Cuddy presents him with a case of a woman caught in an collapsing building, and challenges him to diagnose her on his own, without help, before the day is through. House accepts, hijacks a janitor to serve as soundboard, and diagnoses the woman. Once treatment is started, new symptoms arise. Every time House diagnoses a new problem, another crops up. The woman's boyfriend and mother seem to have no idea about what went on in her life. They claim she was a happy young woman, but House can prove she was on anti-depressants when he finds her diary. They are sure she was no drinker, but House proves she was a heavy drinker. The boyfriend claims they wanted children, but House finds evidence of at least one abortion, and traces of anti-conception medication. When she proves to be allergic to a drug she has recently taken without problems, House starts to suspect something else is going on. People lie, but the facts never do. Yet here, the facts seem to lie as well. Wilson has another way of forcing House to hire a team : he kidnaps House's new guitar. House goes overboard about this, and kidnaps one of Wilson's patients. The realization that the patient could be mistaken by the staff for someone else, finally sets House on the right path to solve the problem at hand. He grudgingly admits that, with a team, he would have solved the case much faster, and decides to hire new people. Of course, he will do it \"the House way\".—damienklael</td>\n",

As House probes the woman and her injured daughter for any leads as to what might be causing her condition, House is convinced that the woman is withholding information. When the woman's daughter reveals some very descriptive details about her mother's personal life, House isn't so sure the woman hides anything about herself from the people around her, especially her daughter. As the team runs tests to find out what caused her paralysis, the woman loses her eyesight and her system begins to shut down, and House and the team are baffled as to whether it is the woman herself, or her own physiology that is lying to them. Meanwhile, House lets his team participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange, but he puts his own twist on the holiday tradition.—Blue, taken from the FOX website.</td>\n",

When he then gives her an injection of epinephrine, she goes into cardiac arrest, leading Dr. Cuddy to assume that House gave her an accidental overdose. Absolutely sure that he gave the patient the correct dosage, House begins a series of unorthodox treatments to uncover the truth, and also does a bit of snooping into the sister's past.—Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>   \n",

       "490   House is without a team, but is unfazed by it. Cuddy and Wilson both try to get him to hire a new team, but House argues he doesn't need a team. Cuddy presents him with a case of a woman caught in an collapsing building, and challenges him to diagnose her on his own, without help, before the day is through. House accepts, hijacks a janitor to serve as soundboard, and diagnoses the woman. Once treatment is started, new symptoms arise. Every time House diagnoses a new problem, another crops up. The woman's boyfriend and mother seem to have no idea about what went on in her life. They claim she was a happy young woman, but House can prove she was on anti-depressants when he finds her diary. They are sure she was no drinker, but House proves she was a heavy drinker. The boyfriend claims they wanted children, but House finds evidence of at least one abortion, and traces of anti-conception medication. When she proves to be allergic to a drug she has recently taken without problems, House starts to suspect something else is going on. People lie, but the facts never do. Yet here, the facts seem to lie as well. Wilson has another way of forcing House to hire a team : he kidnaps House's new guitar. House goes overboard about this, and kidnaps one of Wilson's patients. The realization that the patient could be mistaken by the staff for someone else, finally sets House on the right path to solve the problem at hand. He grudgingly admits that, with a team, he would have solved the case much faster, and decides to hire new people. Of course, he will do it \"the House way\".—damienklael   \n",

As House probes the woman and her injured daughter for any leads as to what might be causing her condition, House is convinced that the woman is withholding information. When the woman's daughter reveals some very descriptive details about her mother's personal life, House isn't so sure the woman hides anything about herself from the people around her, especially her daughter. As the team runs tests to find out what caused her paralysis, the woman loses her eyesight and her system begins to shut down, and House and the team are baffled as to whether it is the woman herself, or her own physiology that is lying to them. Meanwhile, House lets his team participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange, but he puts his own twist on the holiday tradition.—Blue, taken from the FOX website.   \n",
