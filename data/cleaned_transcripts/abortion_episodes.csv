 All right. You heard the doctor. 
 Here we go. 
 We got a GSW.

 We're gonna need some hands out there. 
 Clear Trauma   . 
 A patient's gonna strangle 
 on Christmas lights. 
 -He's between the cars. 
 -l see him. 
 Okay, l can see him. 
 All right, he's still breathing. 
 l got a pulse. 
 We gotta get him out of here. 
 Lift him up. 
 All right. 
 Easy! Watch his head. 
 Joe, you got him? 
 Bag him. 
 Connie, notify the O.R., get Benton 
 and order eight units O-neg. 
 Bob, call Security. 
 We got a gangbanger here. 
 Gangbanger? 
 Dial  - -  and say, ''Help!'' 
 Open the Trauma Care Unit! 
 ln winter, l wish they'd 
 dump the bodies inside. 
 Yeah, pretty inconsiderate of them. 
 Trauma  , call the blood bank. 
 We need eight units of O-neg. 
 And l need a page on Benton. Now. 
 Get his clothes off. 
 Gary, can you grab that? 
 Abdomen, chest, neck, legs. 
 Pulse      and thready. 
 Decreased breath sounds hyperresonant 
 on the right. l'll decompress. 
 Fourteen gauge? 
 Get your souvenirs here. 
 l'll get it out of here. 
 Let's intubate him. 
 Carter, jump in here. 
 Me? 
 You've seen    of these by now, right? 
 Advance the blade to the epiglottis, 
 then lift. 
 -l can't see a thing in here. 
 -Okay, l'll suction. 
 Visualize the vocal cords, 
 and pass the tube through them. 
 Stay away from that esophagus. 
 Good. 
 -You got it. 
 -Nice work, Carter. 
 O.R.'s waiting. 
 What've we got? 
 Tube's in. Let's go! 
 g*nsh*t wounds to the neck, 
 chest, abdomen and legs. 
 lntubated. Gave two liters of saline, 
 needs a thoracotomy and laparotomy. 
 Clear that elevator! 
 -l'd like to follow through the O.R. 
 -There'll be enough bodies there. 
 -l haven't been there yet. 
 -l'll take him from here. 
 l'm the one who found him. 
 Well, you probably saved his life. 
 Let's go. 
 We got a dead shovel in   and 
 a paper cut in the Suture Room. 
 Paper cut? 
 The guy says his newspaper jumped up 
 and att*cked him. 
 We're waiting for psych. 
 lsn't it comforting to know that 
 won't be any different than      ? 
 Excuse me. Carter? 
 Can you call the medical examiner 
 to pick up the dead shovel in  ? 
 What's a dead shovel? 
 Fat man shoveling snow. 
 Heart palpitations and a fractured 
 femur. She's waiting on the orthopods. 
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 
 l've been here for hours now, 
 and l feel absolutely fine. 
 Mrs. Davies is the mitral prolapse 
 with resolved SVT. 
 Yeah, resolved and forgotten. 
 Where's Dr. Lewis? 
 She'll be with you 
 as soon as she can. 
 l hope so. l have a  -year-old 
 at home with the mumps. 
 So do l. 
 Gets on your nerves, doesn't it? 
 Thank you. 
 You can do it. 
 l can do it. 
 Just swing on. 
 You mean hang on? 
 l can't do it, Bob. l can't do it! 
 Yes. Yes, you can! 
 You okay? 
 New Year's revolution. 
 Resolution. l quit smoking. 
 -She had a menthol. 
 -Menthols don't count. 
 My resolution was 
 to quit doing scut work. 
 After l take these to the lab. 
 He failed. Why can't l? 
 -ls Dr. Benton back from surgery yet? 
 -Been and gone! 
 Thank you. 
 This is gross! 
 -Shut up, Stewey! 
 -No, you! 
 You started it. 
 Now stop it! 
 Let the doctor do his work! 
 Perhaps Binky wants to wait outside. 
 You know, Mrs. Bimley, 
 Stewey's eye is gonna be just fine. 
 A word of caution: Keep all the g*ns, 
 even the paint g*ns, away from the kids. 
 Well, obviously. 
 Do you think l'm an idiot? 
 Come on, Stewey, let's go! 
 Binky! 
 l got a bumsicle for you. 
 Freeze-dried at the backdoor. 
 -Let's clear Trauma   . 
 -Got to go. 
 Welcome back. 
 l found him on   rd Street. 
 Gilbert McCabe. 
 Legs frozen to the sidewalk. 
 l was just sleeping. 
 l feel fine. Put me down. 
 You can't even stand up. 
 We had to chip the ice with a tire iron. 
 They woke me up is what they did. 
 Mr. McCabe, my name's Dr. Greene. 
 This is Dr. Hicks. 
 We're gonna check you over. 
 l don't want some colored woman 
 working on me. 
 Like l said, '   is gonna be 
 just like '  . 
 l said, put me down. 
 What are you, deaf? 
 -Dr. Kayson. 
 -l'm very busy, Dr. Lewis. 
 This'll just take a minute. 
 l've got a patient with-- 
 You'll have to wait. l've got 
 a patient coming out of surgery. 
 Mrs. Davies, 
 everything checks out okay. 
 Your heart rate's normalized. 
 We need to increase your verapamil. 
 So l can go? 
 Not until the attending cardiologist 
 gives the okay. 
 Don't worry, you'll have time 
 for your daughter's mumps. 
 They last a good seven days. 
 You have to take them off. 
 The hell l do. 
 -You need Carter? 
 -Not if you do. 
 Bowel disimpaction in   . 
 -How was surgery? 
 -Which surgery? 
 -The g*ng kid from this morning. 
 -He died     minutes in. 
 This is my surgical rotation. 
 -Your ER surgical rotation. 
 -l haven't stepped foot in an O.R. 
 You always treat students like this? 
 Dr. Benton, l hate to complain, 
 but all l do is scut work. 
 l did it for my surgical resident. 
 We all did. 
 And you'll do it until 
 you can do it in your sleep. 
 You are a medical student. 
 You're here to make my life easier. 
 Yeah, l'm also here to learn. 
 And have you? 
 Learned? 
 Glove up and dig in. 
 And don't take all day. 
 -Can you feel anything here? 
 -Keep it where l can see it. 
 Mr. McCabe. 
 -Are you feeling anything here? 
 -Where? 
 -How about that? You feel that? 
 -No. 
 And don't touch those pants. 
 -Now? 
 -No, nothing hurts. 
 And don't get into those pockets. 
 l got all my money in those pockets. 
 What do you keep poking for? 
 My feet feel fine. 
 lt's just that they're a little heavy. 
 Like a chunk of wood. 
 And l wanna take those shoes with me. 
 Do you hear me? 
 Connie, set up a morphine drip and 
 a gram of Ancef, and a tetanus booster. 
 No. l don't want any dr*gs. 
 Heparin,      units. 
 You have severe frostbite in your feet 
 and legs. lce crystals in the tissues. 
 We need to warm them up quickly 
 in a whirlpool bath. 
 You mean like a Jacuzzi? 
 Yeah, like a Jacuzzi. 
 We'll see if there's any tissue damage 
 and decide if we need surgery. 
 Oh, no, l won't need that! That's a 
 perfectly good pair of hoofers. 
 Just need a little warming up, 
 that's all. 
 Tell them l'm taking my clothes with me. 
 l don't want some bonehead 
 stealing them. 
 Mrs. Davies is    years old... 
 ...known history of recurrent, 
 easily controlled SVT. 
 You should've released her hours ago. 
 l tried to talk to you 
 on your way to recovery. 
 You should've come to me 
 a long time before that. 
 Hey, Susie! 
 Not now, Chloe. 
 l did try to find you. 
 l gotta tell you something. 
 Hey, are you one of Susie's teachers? 
 Here's your release. 
 Next time, Dr. Lewis, try harder. 
 Oh, Mrs. Davies needs you. 
 -Stop coming by. 
 -Let me tell you something. 
 -lt can't wait until tonight? 
 -l won't be here tonight. 
 Ronnie and l are moving to Texas. 
 l've come to say goodbye. 
 Susan, are you coming? 
 What are you gonna do? 
 l don't know, 
 learn how to cook chili. 
 This isn't funny. 
 You and Ronnie are moving to Texas. 
 You're not even sure he can get a job. 
 l told you, he's got an uncle 
 that works in a refinery. 
 -Where are you going to live? 
 -l always figure that stuff out. 
 You're pregnant. 
 lt's a little different this time. 
 This is crazy! 
 l don't think you should go. 
 You want me, Ronnie and the baby 
 to stay with you? 
 You don't even want me 
 to have the baby. 
 l just think that you should-- 
 l want to, and l'm going to. 
 At least stay in Chicago. 
 l'll talk to Mom and Dad-- 
 l don't want that! 
 l don't want to stay with people that 
 always think l'm doing the wrong thing. 
 l am gonna love this baby, 
 Susan, so much. 
 And l want everyone else 
 to love it too. 
 You gonna eat that? 
 l'll send you a postcard 
 from the Alamo, okay? 
 Chloe, wait! 
 You don't even have a winter coat. 
 Thanks. 
 l'll wear it. 
 l'll wear it all the time. 
 Give him a liter of Ringer's the 
 first hour,     line. Start a Foley. 
 BP's    over   . 
 Resps shallow at   . 
 Full thickness burns to both legs. 
 Check who's covering plastics. 
 -We need more sterile saline. 
 -Lydia's coming with it. 
 -Third degrees to the scalp and face. 
 -Chest and abdomen burns are minor. 
 -Burn Unit's notified, Mark. 
 -Thanks, Lydia. 
 Pulse ox is   . 
 -Any other firemen hurt? 
 -No. 
 Give him     of morphine. 
 Want me to get rid of them? 
 No, no. Let them stay. 
 Jos√©, you're missing my point. 
 We are not a pizza joint, 
 and we do not deliver. 
 Okay, sure. 
 Take your business elsewhere. 
 -Guy wants us to make house calls. 
 -How quaint. 
 You have, Dr. Ross, 
 won the Pick Three Lotto. 
 We got a runny nose in   , 
 a cough and a sore throat in  ... 
 ...and babies having babies 
 over at Curtain Number  . 
 Babies it is. 
 -Thanks. 
 -Sure thing. 
 So how was New Year's Eve? 
 Sorry l didn't make it. 
 Neither did we. 
 Walt and l fell out by    :  . 
 So what does he think 
 about your new job? 
 He's happy. 
 Kids me about it all the time. 
 Says working for Parks and Recs is 
 like being an urban forest ranger. 
 Yeah, but l bet Mom's proud, right? 
 That's what we need 
 to talk about, Peter. 
 Walt and l saw this really nice place 
 across from Bryn Mawr Park. 
 She'd have her own room, people to spend 
 time with her, nurses to look after her. 
 What are you talking about? 
 l don't think we can keep 
 caring for her. 
 Since the stroke, she's been in and out. 
 She needs constant looking after. 
 l don't know constant. 
 You wouldn't know constant, 
 because you're never around. 
 With this new job, 
 l'm not able to do it anymore... 
 ...and l don't want the kids to 
 take on that responsibility. 
 Steven's in basketball, Joanie's doing 
 plays. l can't ask them to give it up. 
 Why? Because that's what you did 
 when you were looking after me. 
 When Mom went back to work, 
 we didn't have much choice, did we? 
 l do have a choice about my own kids. 
 Jackie... 
 ...there's gotta be something else. 
 What about Mrs. Lukey? 
 -She's only   years younger than Mom. 
 -She looked after that old man. 
 She lives across the street. 
 She can come over and spend the days. 
 l'll make the arrangements 
 to pay for it. 
 Since when do you have extra money? 
 Let me worry about that. 
 ls this a done deal 
 just because you say so? 
 Where have you been for the past   years 
 while Walt and l worried about it? 
 l can't put her in a home. 
 You won't have to. 
 lt's our decision. 
 All of ours. 
 lt can't always be about 
 what you want, Peter. 
 l'm gonna miss my bus. 
 Doc... 
 ...what's the story? 
 How's our boy? 
 lt's not great, guys. 
 Sorry. 
 He's got full-thickness burns 
 to   % of his body. 
 He needs to go up to the O.R. 
 for d√©bridement... 
 ...and then to the Burn Unit. 
 But he'll make it? 
 l'll know more in about     hours. 
 Okay, thanks, Doc. 
 Dr. Greene, can l talk to you? 
 Yeah, can l borrow your pen? 
 l don't know if this is appropriate. 
 l'm not sure Dr. Benton's 
 interested in supervising me. 
 l'm fairly certain that he's not. 
 So the warm, fuzzy demeanor's 
 not getting through to you? 
 Yes, that would be accurate. 
 l had a ton of residents like Benton. 
 l think Benton had 
 a ton of residents like Benton. 
 He's not the worst one you'll get. 
 My advice? 
 Get used to it. 
 Lydia, l need some help 
 with those teenagers. 
 She can't. 
 She's on her way to Radiology. 
 She's quitting smoking. 
 She's chewing nicotine gum. 
 The whole pack? 
 You okay? 
 l've never seen anything like that. 
 l just started... 
 ...three weeks ago. 
 Maybe l shouldn't be doing this. 
 l didn't think it would 
 scare me like this. 
 You need to get some rest. 
 Go home, okay? 
 Get some sleep. 
 Breathe. 
 Breathe. 
 The EKGs are normal? 
 That's right. So are your blood tests, 
 chest x-rays and enzymes. 
 No damage to the heart muscle. 
 So what was this pain then? 
 Probably muscular. 
 You take all this time 
 just to tell me l pulled a muscle? 
 So l take that 
 anti-inflammatory again? 
 Again? 
 A couple of months ago, my wife made me 
 clean the garage. Threw my back out. 
 Two months ago? 
 That's what l said. 
 Oh, they gave you Feldene. 
 Your pain's stopped. 
 You don't need to take it. 
 So l'm out of here. 
 l can't discharge you exactly yet. 
 What's the deal? You said l was fine. 
 l've got three customers this afternoon. 
 l'll run your tests by the cardiologist 
 on call. Then we can sign you out. 
 -Have you seen Mark? 
 -Down one. 
 lt's okay, she's a nurse. 
 Sorry. Chopper's setting down 
 in two minutes with an MVA. 
 -Get Benton for it. 
 -He's still at lunch. 
 Here's your pap tray. 
 Thank you, Dr. Carter. 
 He's your man. 
 Right this way. 
 Paramedics are bringing in an MVA. 
 l need you to bring him down. 
 Wait. By myself? 
 Excellent! 
 lt's    degrees out. 
 You might want to get your coat. 
 My coat.

 All right, come on.

 -Give me a suction cath. 
 -Respirator? 
 -No, we'll bag him. 
 His abdomen's rigid. 
 Peritoneal lavage? 
 Would you like to do that also, 
 Mr. Carter? 
 -No, you can do that one. 
 -Why, thank you. 
 Don't bother, Peter. 
 l got a team scrubbing up. 
 Move him upstairs. 
 Give me the b*llet.

 Great. Missed two appointments, 
 and you tell me to see my own doctor. 
 Sorry it took so long. 
 We wanted to be thorough. 
 Sure, sure. Thanks, okay? 
 -l'll send a nurse in. 
 -Great. 
 Dr. Lewis. 
 When l was a resident, l was always 
 worried about people's approval. 
 The attending, the patients. 
 Maybe because l was a woman. 
 A black woman. 
 Life was a lot easier 
 once l got over it. 
 Don't let the patients 
 get to you, Dr. Lewis. 
 We treat them as soon as we can. 
 Don't apologize for how long it takes. 
 We're a busy hospital, 
 not a restaurant. 
 -Gaby started it. 
 -l did not! 
 -You did too! 
 -Did not. 
 Ladies, you're sisters. 
 We can work this out. 
 Sally didn't want the name Emily. 
 lt's Grandma's name.

 Severe substernal chest pain

 He's had five morphine-- 
 He's got a new holosystolic murmur with

 We need to take certain emergency 
 measures to stabilize your husband. 
 Ms. Maryanski.... 
 Ms. Maryanski, l'm sorry it's not 
 the news that you wanted to hear. 
 No, l want this baby. 
 ls it your husband? 
 He doesn't want to have the baby? 
 Ms. Maryanski... 
 ...this is something that the two of 
 you, as a couple, really should discuss. 
 He's infertile! 
 Well... 
 ...in that case... 
 ...that, yeah, would be.... 
 These are the maxillary sinuses. 
 Opacification on the affected side... 
 ...is a subtle clue that the inferior 
 wall of the orbit is fractured. 
 lf this isn't a good time.... 
 Sorry, it's been a long day. 
 Actually, l'm scrubbing with Dr. Benton 
 on a gallbladder in   minutes. 
 Well, if l know Dr. Benton, 
 he'll be early. 
 Better get out of here. 
 Remember these three things: 
 Cystic duct, common duct, liver. 
 Get out of here. 
 They're asleep. 
 You scared me. 
 Sorry. 
 Their blood gases have normalized. 
 Their CO levels are down. 
 They're gonna be fine. 
 They're on a   :   hold. 
 Well, l just wanted to check on them 
 before l head out. 
 Mr. Babcock owned a bakery. 
 Started it the year they were married. 
 He still makes a three-tiered cake... 
 ...every June    th on their anniversary. 
 They got lucky today. 
 l think maybe they've been 
 lucky every day. 
 Carter.... 
 Don't butt in backwards. 
 You're not sterile yet. 
 Turn on the faucet with your knee. 
 Pop open a brush packet. 
 Come on, get it open. 
 Good. 
 Now, get your hands wet, 
 starting with your fingernails. 
 Scrub your fingers     times. 
 Front, side...

 Like this? 
 Yeah, sort of. 
 Then scrub the palm     times. 
 Back of the hands... 
 ...down the arm... 
 ...front, side... 
 ...back, up to the elbows. 
 Then rinse... 
 ...so that the water runs 
 down your arms... 
 ...not your hands. You got it? 
 Yeah, l think so. 
 Good. Remember,     times. 
 And hurry up. 
 -- ,  ,  ,  ,  ,    . 
 Good, just pull it right back. 
 Sometimes l like to pull 
 the thing back and hold it. 
 Get it out of your way. 
 -There you go. 
 -All right. 
 Let it spring right back. 
 Good. 
 So you saw a piano showroom? 
 Yeah, a piano showroom, right on 
 the Expressway. Drove right by it. 
 lt's-- 
 Let's Bovie this bleeder. 
 What's so strange about that? 
 l've been driving that same route home 
 every night for six years... 
 ...and l never even saw it 
 until last night. 
 But there it was... 
 ...on the Eisenhower, 
 right off Central. 
 Well, l guess that is strange. 
 Scalpel. 
 Okay. Now divide the 
 anterior rectus fascia. 
 Yeah, let's Hoover that puppy. 
 Good, good. 
 Shirley, is it hot in here? 
 No, Dr. Morgenstern. l think it 
 must be the change of life. 
 Pianos on the Expressway? 
 Thank you, Shirley. 
 You may go now. 
 Let's zap that guy, will you? 
 Mr. Carter. 
 Glad you could join us. 
 Tonsil clamp. 
 Peter, divide the rectus, 
 then grab the posterior rectus sheath. 
 Straight arms. 
 Good. Very good. 
 Right hand. 
 Right hand. 
 Sorry, l thought you meant 
 your right hand. 
 No, your right hand. 
 Left hand. 
 Grab it. 
 We'll straighten it up. 
 Good. Spin. 
 Still with us, Carter? 
 Yeah, right here. 
 You're done. 
 Okay, there's the fundus. 
 Okay, grab it. 
 Dr. Benton.... 
 What is it, Carter? 
 Where should l stand? 
 Not right there. 
 And don't touch my shoulder. 
 You just contaminated yourself. 
 Shirley, will you take him out? 
 Want to play a round 
 of foreign capitals? 
 You know, l hate this game. 
 Yes! Doug! 
 Yes! Doug! 
 No! 
 No, no, no! 
 Don't move. 
 What was your name again? 
 Someday l'm gonna believe 
 that line out of you. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Can you remember the names of 
 all the women you've slept with? 
 No. 
 So someday you'll forget mine. 
 Now you're assuming 
 that we won't last. 
 Well... 
 ...yeah. 
 Where are you going? 
 l've got that conference 
 in the morning. 
 We treated this older couple today. 
 They were married    years. 
 -They seemed pretty happy about it. 
 -That's them, not us. 
 How do you know? 
 How did they know? 
 Because if it were us, 
 we wouldn't be doing this. 
 We'd both be married... 
 ...have daughters in Girl Scouts... 
 ...be renting The Lion King. 
 We'd never have met, because we'd 
 already be committed to somebody else. 
 Don't you want that? 
 Not now. 
 Not with me? 
 Same thing. 
 Then why don't l want it? 
 Because you are afraid. 
 -Most men are afraid. 
 -Of what? 
 Responsibility, aging, death... 
 ...diminished sexual capacity. 
 See you. 
 lceland? 
 Reykjavik. 
 Don't move. 
 Belarus. 
 Minsk. 
 Okay, pack off the colon, 
 duodenum and stomach. 
 Suction. 
 Zaire. 
 Kinshasa. 
 Perhaps your student 
 should step a little closer. 
 Yeah, l guess you're right. 
 We're all packed off here. 
 Peel it like a pear. 
 Grab at the ampulla, 
 and dissect Calot's triangle. 
 Mr. Carter. 
 Can you tell us what defines 
 Calot's triangle? 
 The cystic duct, the common duct 
 and the liver? 
 Hold this retractor, will you? 
 Let's get a little Bovie here. 
 Mr. Carter. 
 Have you ever noticed the piano showroom 
 on the Eisenhower Expressway? 
 And so then she blurts out, 
 ''He's infertile.'' 
 Susan, that's my best story 
 of the new year. 
 Sorry, it's just been another 
 incredibly hateful day with Kayson. 
 Well, you buy into it. You can't 
 let him ride you like that. 
 l put salt on them. 
 Shouldn't eat salt. 
 -What are you doing? 
 -l need more Tabasco. 
 -You haven't tasted them yet. 
 -Don't need to. 
 -But if you haven't tasted them-- 
 -You have a problem with this? 
 No. Absolutely not. 
 Saw Chloe wandering 
 around the halls today. 
 She was so calm 
 l hardly recognized her. 
 Thanks, Mark. 
 Sorry, that was stupid. 
 They're moving to Texas. Ronnie will 
 dig for oil, and she'll have his baby. 
 Assuming it is his baby. 
 Why don't they stay here? 
 -l told her to get an abortion. 
 -Why'd you do that? 
 -Because l think she should. 
 -That's not very supportive. 
 Supportive of what? 
 My sister's fantasy of having a child? 
 She thinks it's like having a pet. 
 A little puppy who will follow her 
 and love her forever... 
 ...who won't care that she's 
 an alcoholic and abuses dr*gs... 
 ...that she gets diseases from 
 sleeping with every guy on the corner. 
 This baby may turn her around. 
 You don't know. 
 Like the one we delivered 
 this afternoon? 
 -Maybe. l don't know. 
 -Well, l do. 
 No, you don't. That's the point. 
 None of us do. 
 Chloe and the baby will have a chance. 
 Who are you to decide? 
 l'm her sister. 
 l pick up the pieces. 
 lt's still her choice. 
 l would support it if she'd ever taken 
 any responsibility for her life... 
 ...before taking on another. 
 l love her, but she 
 can't even part her hair. 
 So do l think she should bring a child 
 into this world? No, l do not. 
 Kayson? 
 Vennerbeck is dead, Dr. Lewis. 
 Oh, God. 
 l've reviewed his file. 
 He shouldn't have been released. 
 You approved it. 
 l didn't have all the information. 
 What information? 
 Two months ago he had back pain. 
 The diagnosis was musculoskeletal. 
 lt was atypical angina, 
 and you should've told me. 
 -You didn't ask for his medical history. 
 -Do l have to ask for everything? 
 What are you suggesting? 
 l am suggesting this case was 
 more complicated than you thought. 
 That your experience 
 was not sufficient... 
 ...to either determine that 
 or to present it to those who could. 
 l presented what you asked for. 
 But not the entire picture! 
 And because of that, a man is dead. 
 And his wife is 
 consulting their attorney. 
 Dr. Morgenstern is aware 
 of this situation. 
 And l have requested 
 a full case review.

 Randi, you know we got

 The morgue's slow. I put him

 - Good thinking.

 Not a single patient. 
 It's too cold to be sick.

 I've got tenure review this week.

 Dr. Greene? Legal sent you

 Won't help.

 Is that why E-Ray's

 So I'm kind of in a bind. 
 Sorry. Not interested. 
 All right. We'll keep looking. 
 Wendy. 
 Very good! 
 How much are a dozen bananas?

 Mary, what's up? 
 Budget just came out. 
 We've got a crisis conference 
 tomorrow morning. 
 - Crisis conference? 
 - ER nursing's $  ,    over. 
 Can't we add to it? 
 You're gonna have 
 to let two nurses go. 
 But I'm understaffed as it is. 
 Name me a department that isn't. 
 The county's out of money. 
 You've got three junior RNs: 
 Maylik... 
 - Malik. 
 - Malik McGrath, Chuny Marquez and Conni... 
 Oligario. 
 You can keep one. 
 Which two get the ax? 
 That's your decision. 
 I don't know. 
 I've never done this before. 
 I gotta have an answer by tomorrow. 
 Are you on tonight? 
 Leave it on my e-mail. 
 Make sure I get it by

 If you could choose how to die,

 That's morbid. 
 If I could choose how to die,

 - Nope, but we got takeout. 
 We ordered you your usual. 
 What do I owe you, Chuny? 
 - Put it away. 
 - Come on. Conni? 
 - We got you covered. 
 - Thanks. 
 - My hands cold? 
 - Oh, God! Sadist! 
 I'm sorry about that 
 surprise Christmas morning. 
 Santa didn't come? 
 I opened my door to 
 a homeless street urchin. 
 - You opened my door. 
 - Right. I opened her door. 
 - She stole Mom's silverware. 
 - I'll pay for it. 
 - She won't take your money. 
 - I won't offer again. 
 My New Year's resolution is to 
 resist charitable impulses. 
 Risk Management said we're 
 overdue for a safety check. 
 Why tell me? 
 You're the safety officer. 
 They want it done tonight. 
 - I got    charts to do... 
 - Carol and I will take it. 
 What happened to resisting 
 charitable impulses? 
 Speaking of, anyone wanna 
 sign up for a night shift study? 
 Boy, it is dead! 
 Finished my charts. 
 It's not even  :  . 
 - Want some action? 
 - What do you got in mind? 
 Edson's sick, you can take 
 his place on the code team. 
 Absolutely. 
 Hey, John. 
 He boned me, man! 
 Benton wouldn't let you off? 
 Two days is all I asked for. 
 Son of a bitch! 
 You know, Dennis... 
 ...if Monique's with this other guy, 
 there's nothing you can do... 
 ...even if you did fly down there. 
 I'd sure as hell like 
 the chance to try. 
 You wanna go to that place 
 and get some fries with gravy? 
 I wish I could. 
 I got all these charts to do. 
 Okay. I hear you. 
 If Benton asks, I'll be 
 back in an hour. 
 I thought you finished the charts. 
 I've listened to him moan about 
 that girlfriend for two weeks. 
 Tonight is slow enough. 
 Who's our first lucky customer? 
 Lady fell asleep at McGoo's. 
 Waitress brought her in. 
 She's kind of loopy. No I.D. 
 Says her name's Shelly. 
 No needles! 
 I just wanna sleep. 
 Temp's    , and look at this. 
 Photophobia. 
 I'm Dr. Greene. 
 I need to examine you. 
 Leave me alone! 
 You have symptoms of meningitis, 
 which is really serious. 
 We need to do a spinal tap 
 just to be sure. 
 Let me give you 
 a shot of antibiotics. 
 No needles, I said! 
 If you do have meningitis and we 
 don't treat you, you could die. 
 Die, cry, let me fry. 
 Do you know where you are? 
 In the hospital, talking to Dr. Greene 
 with a head like a bean. 
 Do you know what day it is? 
 Thursday, January   th. 
 Bing! Correct! 
 Alex Trebek, next: 
 Stupid Questions for $    . 
 I'm   o/o sure it's meningitis, which 
 is probably causing her mental status. 
 She won't let me take blood. 
 She can't make her own decisions. 
 - I need a consent override. 
 - Run it by Risk Management. 
 - No, I don't. 
 - Yeah, you do. 
 All consent overrides 
 go through Legal. 
 Fine. Tell them 
 I'm doing a spinal tap... 
 ...on a demented woman 
 without her consent. 
 Well, we've got some loose tile here. 
 And some crumbling grout. 
 Faulty tile and grout. 
 This could be trouble 
 in an open wound. 
 Trouble indeed! Good catch. 
 Did you note 
 the wobbly IV stands? 
 Roger that. 
 You got a flair for this. 
 Thank you. 
 You know... 
 ...this clock could fall 
 right off the wall. 
 I don't know how you do it. 
 It's established that night work 
 disrupts circadian rhythms. 
 I've heard that. 
 I hope to prove 
 moderate physical exertion... 
 ...can switch circadian rhythms 
 back into phase. 
 When you say 
 ""moderate physical exertion""... 
 A few minute's exercise. 
 Jog around the block. Not strenuous. 
 It's all set up. 
 I don't know, I'm not in good shape. 
 You look plenty healthy to me. 
 Oh, my God! 
 - Are you okay? 
 - What were you doing? 
 Safety check. You okay? 
 - I'm bleeding. 
 - I can stitch it up. 
 I would prefer Jeanie. 
 And you were doing so well. 
 Maggie, you got anything good? 
 Carol Hathaway dropped 
 a clock on Weaver's head. 
 - Deliberately? 
 - I'm foggy on the details. 
 We got paramedics pulling up. 
 Now we're talking! 
 - Nobody called for a surgical consult. 
 - I'm saving you the trouble. 
 Found him on the floor 
 in acute distress. 
 Chest and belly pain. 
 Vitals, normal. 
 Wouldn't let us start an IV. 
 Does this hurt? 
 Looks like a surgical abdomen. 
 - I haven't made that assessment. 
 - You don't have to. 
 Should I call for an Attending? 
 Up and over! 
 Let's get an IV started. 
 I think I hear a rub. 
 I may have a pulsatile mass. 
 Give me a   -lead and a chest film. 
 Get me a cross-table abdomen. 
 - Which first? 
 - Chest. 
 Abdomen. 
 He could have an aneurysm. 
 - I don't want to miss an acute MI. 
 - I don't want to miss a triple-A. 
 If it's an MI, he needs TPA. 
 If it's an aneurysm, 
 he goes to O.R. 
 Time is heart muscle. 
 Ever have an aneurysm 
 blow up in your face? 
 Hey, guys. 
 I'm feeling much better. 
 - You need to lie down. 
 - You need x-rays. 
 No. I'm fine... 
 ...except for a stuffy nose. 
 Could I have a flu shot? 
 I remember this dude. 
 To get a ride to the hospital, 
 he calls     and plays possum. 
 But I'm on Social Security. 
 I can't afford a cab. 
 And it's too cold for the bus. 
 You want a flu shot? 
 If it wouldn't be too much trouble? 
 It's all yours. 
 Gee, thanks! 
 I'm just saying, there's no point 
 in me going back to general surgery. 
 You learned all there is? 
 I want another Pediatric rotation. 
 - Why? 
 - I want to be a pediatric surgeon. 
 She said that my technique 
 was excellent. 
 You're in luck. He's doing 
 a jejunal atresia tonight. 
 If he'll take you, 
 you're back in Pediatric. 
 Could I cover Pedes Sick-U? 
 Anything else? 
 No, thank you. 
 - Chuny, you got that LP tray? 
 - By the door. 
 Can you give us a hand? 
 We may need you. 
 There's someone... 
 Why won't you tell me your address? 
 Excuse me. Who are you? 
 Dr. Greene? 
 Pat Guinet, Hospital Counsel. You 
 want to do a spinal tap on this patient? 
 - That's right. 
 - She's not keen on the idea. 
 I've assessed her 
 as mentally incompetent. 
 We just had a fairly 
 coherent conversation. 
 Is that a medical diagnosis? 
 Look, doctor, she's clearly 
 a borderline case. 
 We have been sued 
 by these patients in the past. 
 I'm saving her life, 
 and you're talking legal exposure. 
 That's why I'm paid. 
 I'm paid to help sick people. 
 I'm not gonna wrestle 
 with you, doctor. 
 I'm writing on the chart: 
 ""You're advised against treating 
 this woman without her consent."" 
 And you and anyone... 
 ...who assists you, will be 
 putting your jobs in jeopardy. 
 Get a psych consult. 
 If they agree she's incompetent, 
 put her on a hold and proceed. 
 Until then, don't touch her. 
 Just one more stitch. 
 Have you given any more thought 
 to participating in my study? 
 I've got paperwork I need to do. 
 It won't take much time. 
 Just    minutes every couple hours. 
 - Lf we get busy, it'll be a problem. 
 - It's been slow so far. 
 My being HIV-positive 
 won't skew the results? 
 Won't make a bit of difference. 
 Tonight's my last night to 
 collect data. And if l... 
 My findings will be incom... 
 well, worthless, really. 
 But see, if you're too busy, 
 I respect your decision. 
 Just as I've always respected 
 and supported your decisions. 
 What would I have to do? 
 He scores! 
 - We finally get a bonafide patient? 
 - But we can't touch her. 
 She asked for another blanket 
 and a snack. 
 So we're not a hospital, 
 we're a bed-and-breakfast? 
 Psych come down? 
 - No, not yet. 
 - Try again. I'll be in the lounge. 
 - Call Missing Persons? 
 - Yeah, but no one's missed her. 
 We got a wheelchair with no brakes... 
 ...and three IV stands 
 I think are wobbly. 
 What do we do with them? 
 Ugly! 
 If it isn't my favorite thief. 
 You got your wallet back. 
 My mother's silverware? 
 I didn't take it. I swear. 
 Do I call Security, 
 or will you leave by yourself? 
 No, listen, man. 
 I need some bread. 
 No, serious. 
 There's this dude trying to pimp me. 
 And I don't wanna... 
 He says I gotta pay him 
 bucks, or he'll k*ll me. 
 Maybe we should tell the cops. 
 I don't deal with cops. 
 And I don't deal with liars who take 
 advantage of people who help them. 
 You're a creep. You know that? 
 A creep and a pervert! 
 That's right! This doctor 
 made me go down on him! 
 He gave me VD. 
 He got me pregnant! 
 And now he wants me 
 to pay for the abortion! 
 Child molester! 
 Lovely girl. 
 I wanted to ask you about 
 a Pediatric surgical rotation. 
 This isn't a good time. 
 I'll be in Pedes Sick-U all night. 
 - You were looking for me? 
 - You're on Sick-U with me. 
 Isn't Zeidenberg on? 
 Order everyone's labs 
 and advance the drain on Bed  . 
 Here's one for you. 
 ""Longing for your embrace. 
 Financial officer seeks life 
 of adventure with very special lady."" 
 - Forget it. 
 - Sounds like money, honey. 
 What are we gonna talk about? 
 Dow averages? 
 ""Sensual M.D.,   . 
 -  '   "". 
 - I like tall. 
 Makes up in passion what 
 he lacks in hair."" 
 Not me. 
 I'm not so desperate to use personals. 
 You calling me desperate? 
 No. That's not what I meant. 
 So where do you find all your dates? 
 - I haven't had one in a while. 
 - See? 
 Don't knock it till you try it. 
 Dr. Greene, 
 psych's here on that lady. 
 Who is it? McDonald? 
 No, some intern. 
 I didn't realize we were 
 coming down this hallway. 
 Neither did I. 
 Which room was it, anyway? 
 I don't know. 
 It was either this door or this one. 
 No, Doug. It's this one. 
 Right. Lots of stolen 
 moments in there, huh? 
 Yes, there were. 
 So should we? 
 - What? 
 - Open the door. 
 Oh, yeah, sure. 
 Why not? 
 Come on. You got it? 
 - Did it always smell like this? 
 - I think it did. 
 Now, if I remember... 
 ...I bet we still got some candles. 
 - What? 
 - Yep! Look at this. 
 Got a match? 
 Oh, my God! 
 Shelly, I'm gonna ask you to commit 
 three things to memory: 
 A fire engine, a mobile home 
 and a pen. 
 Why? 
 Just try to remember them. 
 Can you tell me the date? 
 Get away! 
 Temp's up to    . . 
 Look, we're running out of time. 
 Shelly? The date? 
 I already told Dr. Greene-bean. 
 Was she oriented to time? 
 More or less. 
 Oriented to time. 
 Shelly, can you spell ""world"" 
 backwards? 
 U-O-Y 
 W-E-R-C-S. 
 Screw you. 
 Backwards. 
 Right. 
 Good concentration. 
 Can you remember the things 
 I told you earlier? 
 Yes. 
 What are they? 
 A fire engine, a pen, a mobile home. 
 Now leave me alone, cornpone. 
 She's oriented to person, 
 time and place. 
 Her mental status exam is normal. 
 She's uncooperative, 
 she speaks in rhyme... 
 ...and doesn't care that she 
 could die without treatment. 
 There are criteria for competence. 
 She doesn't meet them. 
 She's a woman with no I.D., 
 found passed out in a restaurant. 
 She doesn't meet the criteria. 
 Do you realize your 
 decision could k*ll her? 
 That kind of hyperbole 
 isn't very helpful. 
 Patients have a right 
 to make bad decisions. 
 - Not when they're demented. 
 - That's where we disagree. 
 Get McDonald down here. 
 Tell him it's life or death. 
 Dr. Benton? 
 The Serena kid's in 
 second-degree heart block. 
 Where's his chart? 
 - Kenner's patient? 
 - Yeah, but Kenner's back in surgery. 
 Where are the labs? 
 - On the chart. 
 - The calcium's not here. 
 It wasn't picked up. 
 Give him    of Lasix, IV push, and run 
 a liter of saline to diurese him. 
 Where's Gant? 
 I don't know. 
 Dr. Fogg at Cambridge did 
 a similar study with rodents... 
 ...and could double serum cortisol 
 with five minutes on the treadmill. 
 - How many more minutes do I have? 
 - Fifteen. 
 Dr. Weaver, I'm getting 
 a reading of     lux. 
 - Put the goggles on her. 
 - Goggles? 
 The lights approximate daylight. 
 We wanna make sure your body 
 thinks it's night. 
 What else do I have to do? 
 One more exertion test, heart 
 and lung readings, and that's it. 
 Wendy, let's take 
 the RPMs up to   . 
 I met the guy once last summer. 
 Some type of mortgage broker. 
 I don't know when 
 she started seeing him. 
 Why are you here when a kid 
 is dying of hypercalcemia? 
 You're supposed to monitor 
 his calcium. 
 - I sent the labs in. 
 - Why, if you don't check them? 
 It takes an hour. 
 Look at this.   . ! 
 - He went into a bradyarrhythmia. 
 - I was going to get them. 
 Gant, that kind of excuse 
 kills patients. 
 If you can't do the job, 
 then you don't need to be here. 
 Make another stupid 
 mistake like that, you won't be. 
 Hey, you okay? 
 It's a code. 
 I'm on the code team. 
 Listen, we'll talk, all right? 
 We'll talk when I get back? 
 It's weird, being down here again. 
 Makes me realize how unhappy I was. 
 When you were with me? 
 It wasn't your fault. 
 I just didn't think much of myself. 
 - I'm sure I didn't help. 
 - A lot of stuff didn't help. 
 But it's just different now, you know? 
 I actually feel good. 
 What's different besides us not 
 being together? 
 I used to think I couldn't do things. 
 Now I'm taking a pre-med course. 
 I trust you did well 
 on your midterms. 
 B plus. 
 Clearly, you're not trying 
 hard enough. 
 I guess it's about feeling in control. 
 I guess. 
 Of course, 
 there's things you can't control. 
 Such as? 
 Administration's making me 
 fire two nurses. 
 - Really? 
 - But don't tell anyone. 
 They don't know, and I 
 don't know who it'll be. 
 I'm not gonna say a thing. 
 You know what's really depressing? 
 Being here right now... 
 ...makes me realize how much 
 happier I was back then. 
 - God, you're pathetic. 
 - Yes. 
 - You on the code team? 
 - I was gonna ask you. 
 - Where the hell is A-   ? 
 - I was gonna ask that too. 
 Do you know where A-    is? 
 Somebody's having a heart attack. 
 Sorry. Have you seen the men's 
 room? A toilet overflowed. 
 Nope. Can't help you. 
 ""   ,    . 
 . 
 -    ."" 
 - It must be this way. 
 - I'll do the central line. 
 - I will. 
 - Have you run a code before? 
 - More than you have. 
 Well, here's the toilet. 
 Code team? You're late. 
 Oh, no! 
 - I'll take over. 
 - I got it. 
 He's got a rhythm. 
 - I got a good pulse. 
 - Thank God! 
 CPR course finally paid off. 
 Now, if I could just find that john! 
 Dr. Carter will show you. 
 - Know why I hate going to a shrink? 
 - Why? 
 Because you have to 
 talk about yourself. 
 That's the point, Doug. 
 It's embarrassing. 
 I tell her about my patients. 
 She lets you? 
 She says I prefer talking about them 
 because solving their problems... 
 ...is easier than solving my own. 
 It's probably true. 
 Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, no. 
 You thinking about Charlie? 
 I was tough on her today. 
 Well, you know, 
 you gave her a chance. 
 Several. There's a certain point 
 you just gotta say, ""No. It's over."" 
 Why do those words 
 sound familiar to me? 
 Conni and I wrote 
 a personal ad for you. Wanna hear? 
 Sure. 
 ""Sensitive doctor. 
 Tall, white and handsome."" 
 - Handsome? Really? 
 - Sure. Why not? 
 ""Loves the Cubs and Kawasakis."" 
 Hold on. I own a bike, 
 I don't know if I love it. 
 Chicks love guys with bikes. 
 I got mine in the garage. 
 Your bike? 
 They let me keep it here. 
 But I haven't run it. 
 - Your battery's gonna die. 
 - I gotta start it up. 
 Don't mention the bike. I don't 
 wanna attract motorcycle chicks. 
 Someone like me? 
 No. I didn't mean... 
 Shelly's gone 
 and so are her clothes. 
 - Check the restrooms. 
 - I did that already. 
 Did you see a female 
 patient leave here? 
 Brown hair and red hat? 
 She just left. 
 I'll get Security. 
 Could you grab my coat? 
 Shelly? Shelly? 
 Shelly, you need to come back inside. 
 I want the bus. 
 Listen to me. 
 You're very sick. 
 We need to treat you. 
 - Right away. 
 - Go away. 
 Shelly, come on. 
 Put me down! 
 I wanna go on the bus! 
 Put me down! 
 Help! Help! 
 Why are you hurting me? 
 Grab her legs. 
 Chuny, take her shoulders. 
 Malik, bring her knees 
 up to her chest. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm gonna give you 
 a shot to numb the skin. 
 No! No needles, please! 
 I don't see a psych hold. 
 - Help me. 
 - I got tired of waiting. 
 Hold still. 
 I want everyone's names. 
 - Chuny Marquez. 
 - Lydia Wright. 
 Malik McGrath. 
 No, please! 
 I got fluid. 
 There I was, baring my soul 
 in a way I never really had before. 
 - All of a sudden, I hear snoring. 
 - I'm sorry. I'm so tired. 
 Oh, God! I've got   /  hours 
 to make my big staff decision. 
 - What am I gonna do? 
 - Sorry, what? 
 You're hilarious. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Charlie? 
 Get a gurney! Let's go! 
 What happened? 
 - He found me. 
 - The pimp? Hang on. 
 Get the gurney, Conni! 
 Benton was out of line. 
 - Was he? 
 - Way out of line. 
 - I feel like punching out the bastard. 
 - Well, that would be unwise. 
 I suppose I could tell Anspaugh... 
 ...but then again, I don't know. 
 I think Benton's right. 
 Lately, I've been one step behind, 
 five minutes too late. 
 See you. 
 - Aren't you covering the ER? 
 - It's dead. 
 What I wouldn't give 
 for a good five-car pileup. 
 It's  :  . 
 Time for the 
 Charlie Chan Mystery Movie. 
 What's the point of this exactly? 
 To compare your cortisol 
 after indoor and outdoor exertion. 
 - That's it? 
 - No more sweating after this. 
 Get your knees up, like a drum major. 
 That's it. There you go. 
 Go! Go! Go! 
 Okay, sweetheart. 
 Squeeze this hand. 
 Good. All right. 
 Now squeeze this hand. 
 That's okay. That's all right. 
 - I think she's got a broken right ulna. 
 - Ears are clear. 
 Can you move your jaw for me? 
 Side to side. 
 It hurts. 
 That's okay. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Let's get a panorex. 
 She's got a broken jaw. 
 Let's get a film of the chest, 
 right arm, orbits. 
 She has bruising around her groin. 
 She may have been r*ped. 
 All right, kiddo. 
 It's okay. 
 Your idea's gonna 
 make you a millionaire? 
 - Money in the bank. 
 - Let's hear it. 
 Flypaper in a can. 
 Like aerosol. You spray it on 
 your car so bugs stick to it. 
 You peel off one big sheet. 
 Then boom! 
 - Your car is clean. 
 - You're kidding, right? 
 - I'll call it ""Bug Off."" 
 - That's the dumbest idea ever. 
 Why not just clean it off 
 with a hose? 
 Okay, I got another one. 
 Stethoscope condoms. 
 I don't even want to know. 
 Take my advice. 
 Don't quit your day job. 
 How's it going? 
 Dr. Kenner. 
 We had a scare. 
 His calcium went up to   . ... 
 ...which sent him into heart block. 
 I had to diurese him. 
 I got him back to a normal sinus. 
 Well, it looks fine now. 
 - Good work. 
 - Thank you. 
 I'd like to do another 
 Pediatric rotation... 
 ...and I'd like to do it with you. 
 Correct me if I'm wrong. 
 I understood that Dr. Keaton 
 isn't recommending you. 
 She told you that? 
 Well, it is a pretty small club. 
 We do talk occasionally. 
 Dr. Kenner, I learned a lot 
 from Dr. Keaton... 
 ...but our styles were very different. 
 We didn't quite mesh. 
 Why don't you talk to her 
 and tell her your perspective... 
 ...about not meshing and so on. 
 - Maybe she'll reconsider. 
 - And if she did? 
 Then we could talk. 
 Without a recommendation, 
 I really can't help you. 
 Where am I going? 
 To Radiology to take x-rays. 
 We'll use a machine called a CAT scan 
 to make sure your head's okay. 
 I'm scared. 
 It's okay. 
 I'll come with you. 
 Hang on. 
 Want me to get a r*pe kit? 
 I'm gonna talk to her 
 and see what happened. 
 - Which bone would you choose? 
 - Maybe a finger. 
 If I had to choose a bone to 
 break, I'd choose a clavicle. 
 That's good. 
 No surgical intervention. 
 - I'd go with a skull fracture. 
 - Oh, you would! 
 Crazy! 
 ""Venture to Karachi on the rugged... 
 ...Grand Trunk Road which, 
 while breathtaking... 
 ...is prone to landslides 
 and firefights... 
 ...by warring sectarian factions."" 
 Abby, don't go. 
 Put the book down. 
 Dr. Keaton? 
 - Did you lock the door? 
 - I thought you did. 
 Dr. Keaton, l... 
 Peter, could you wait 
 outside, please? 
 - Anything? 
 - Just doing the ink stain now. 
 I admire you, Dr. Greene. 
 That took guts. 
 Thank you for your support. 
 Don't worry about that lawyer. 
 I'm going to take full responsibility. 
 They can't fire all of us. 
 Sorry if I offended you earlier 
 with that motorcycle crack. 
 It takes a lot to offend me. 
 But seriously, I'd be lucky 
 to find someone like you. 
 Wanna get the lights? 
 Is it meningitis? 
 Cryptococcus. 
 You were right. 
 Randi, have you seen 
 a black binder? 
 The nursing budget? 
 It fell out of the cubby, 
 so I looked at it. 
 Well, where is it? 
 Bad news for some people, huh? 
 - You shouldn't have looked. 
 - I was curious. 
 I took an accounting course. 
 Well, that's no excuse. 
 - It's the overtime that's k*lling you. 
 - What? 
 ER nurses work   -hour shifts. 
 After eight hours, they get overtime. 
 - It's screwing with your budget. 
 - I don't know what else we can do. 
 Put everybody on  -hour shifts. 
 You'll save a hundred grand a year. 
 I know teacher/intern relationships 
 can undermine reputations. 
 The innuendo and rumors. 
 I need to know if you'll be 
 discreet about this. 
 I came by to see if you'd reconsider 
 writing me a recommendation. 
 You've always complimented 
 my surgical skills... 
 ...and with a recommendation, I could 
 get another Pediatric rotation. 
 And if I don't? 
 What do you mean, if you don't? 
 Will you report my relationship 
 with Dr. Carter? 
 You think I'm threatening you? 
 Are you? 
 If your recommendation isn't based 
 on my abilities as a doctor... 
 ...I don't want it. 
 I can't do that, Peter. 
 You've got the makings 
 of an excellent surgeon... 
 ...but not a pediatric surgeon. 
 Dr. Greene, another letter from Legal. 
 What do you know? 
 I've been written up again. 
 Twice in one night. 
 They cc'd Anspaugh. 
 That was very thoughtful. 
 Jerks. 
 Why don't I just get some frames 
 and put these up on the wall? 
 You should do it. 
 - This is George Dunleavy. 
 - What can I do for you? 
 The police said that you 
 may have found my sister, Shelly. 
 A couple of days ago, 
 she said she was sick. 
 I told her to see a doctor. 
 I haven't heard from her since. 
 Does your sister have any 
 psychiatric problems? 
 She was pretty incoherent. 
 Meningitis can cause 
 temporary dementia. 
 Will she be all right? 
 Take a day or two, 
 but she should be fine. 
 - Thank you, doctor. 
 - Sure. 
 I want you to know, Dr. Keaton 
 and I never talked about you. 
 We never said anything about you 
 remotely negative, ever. 
 Carter, it never occurred 
 to me that you had. 
 We were just talking about you. 
 Dr. Gant feels that you've treated 
 him inappropriately in public. 
 Calling him lazy and stupid, 
 I understand? 
 I said what he did 
 was lazy and stupid. 
 It wasn't inappropriate. 
 His inattention almost k*lled a child. 
 That's not true. 
 You neglected your duties. 
 If you feel that way, speak 
 to me. Don't yell at me in public. 
 All right, settle down. 
 You were there, weren't you? 
 Do you feel Dr. Benton's reaction 
 was inappropriate? 
 His language was strong, and I can 
 understand how Dennis feels. 
 But given the circumstances... 
 ...I'm not sure 
 I'd call it inappropriate. 
 Sounds like you have to 
 develop thicker skin, Dr. Gant. 
 And if similar issues arise 
 in the future... 
 ...I suggest you take them up 
 with Dr. Benton directly... 
 ...before you come crying to me. 
 The hard truth is, there's no money. 
 They want me to let people go. 
 - So who gets fired? 
 - Nobody. 
 I sent up a proposal that solves 
 our problems without losing jobs. 
 - You cutting back hours? 
 - No. 
 Instead of three   -hour shifts, 
 everyone will work five  -hour shifts. 
 For the same money? 
 A little less. 
 But we have to work 
 four hours more a week. 
 That sucks. 
 Or two of you are history. 
 - I don't buy that. 
 - They got the money. 
 I'm not giving up my OT. 
 None of us are. We got a contract 
 negotiation coming up. 
 Management pulls this, we walk. 
 That's right. 
 I didn't think you'd 
 really go to Anspaugh. 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 I didn't know what to say. 
 And with Benton standing there... 
 John, it's okay. I didn't mean 
 to put you on the spot. 
 So we're cool? 
 Yeah, we're cool. 
 I'd better get back to the ER. 
 I'll see you later. 
 It's like an x-ray of your head. 
 There's nothing to be afraid of. 
 - Will you stay with me? 
 - I'm gonna be in the next room. 
 Charlie, were you r*ped? 
 Promise you won't tell the cops? 
 I'm not gonna tell anybody. 
 You'll be okay. 
 Here we go. 
 Okay, let's see. 
 Hey, Mark! Mark! 
 You forgot your curriculum vitae. 
 Thanks! 
 After tonight, I figure my chances 
 for making tenure are about nil. 
 But I did my job, 
 and I can do my job somewhere. 
 - Tenure or no tenure. 
 - Same here. 
 They're messing with our overtime. 
 I'll go someplace else. 
 - That's the spirit! 
 - I gotta go. 
 Chuny, you hungry? 
 Wanna grab some breakfast with me? 
 Sure. 
 First I gotta take the bike for 
 a spin just to charge the battery. 
 Why don't I charge it up with you? 
 Sure. Hop on! 
 You want me to get in this box? 
 ""This box"" is a body plethysmograph. 
 - It accurately measures lung capacity. 
 - Why is that important? 
 I need accurate specifications, 
 or I can't correlate the data. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I get claustrophobic. 
 Look at all the windows. 
 You can look out. 
 I'm sorry. I can't. 
 If you don't, I have to 
 throw out two months' work. 
 - I'm not getting in. 
 - You're getting $  . 
 - Shut up. 
 - Please? 
 I'm sorry. It's final. 
 I can't. 
 How about that? 
 - Wendy. 
 - What? 
 - Get in the box. 
 - Me? 
 We'll test lung volume. 
 Then get on the bike. 
 But it's almost daylight. 
 Here, wear the goggles. 
 You won't know the difference. 
 How is she? 
 She's got a broken arm, 
 a lot of bruises. 
 A concussion. She was r*ped. 
 I'll get a kit 
 and call the police. 
 When does the social worker 
 get here? 
 They should be on now. 
 You want me to call? 
 No. I'll do it. 
 The eggs are burning. 
 Oh, well. We'll just have 
 to make some more. 
 I didn't call a surgeon. 
 We finally got a good one. 
 Some guy got hit by the EI. 
 - What you got? 
 - You got a mess. Take a look. 
 Yuck! Which end is up? 
 Jumped or fell in front of a train. 
 Open skull fracture, multiple 
 extremity fractures, flailed chest. 
 - Any signs of life? 
 - He's got a weak pulse. 
 Now all he needs is a face. 
 He's   /  . 
 He ain't gonna last. 
 Everybody, grab hold 
 on my count.  ,  ,  ! 
 - What is this? 
 - Man versus moving El train. 
 su1c1de? 
 He either jumped or tripped. 
 Lost the pulse. 
 Put O-neg on the rapid infuser. 
 Set up a central line. 
 Page Gant. He's supposed to be 
 covering the ER. 
 - I'll do it. 
 - How are his eyes? 
 He's lost one, 
 and the other's swollen shut. 
 Gray matter in the hair. 
 Increased breath sounds. 
 I'll put in a tube. 
 It's a surgical procedure. 
 -    French. 
 - Whose beeper? 
 It's coming from him. 
 -    blade. 
 - What number did you page Gant to? 
 This room,     . 
 That's the number on this pager. 
 Oh, my God! The patient. 
 It's Gant. 
 Dennis? 
 Oh, sweet Jesus! 
 Carter, put the tube in! 
 Seal him with thoraseal! 
 Move! 
 - Flat line. 
 - Give me an amp of epi... 
 ...and atropine. 
 Let's go, Carter! 
 I'm trying! 
 Get it in! Get it in! 
 It's in.

 then you can keep your money.

 Cancer's back.

 I don't want any more chemo.

 We often tape laparoscopic procedures.

 - Right. I'm sorry. 
 Before I make any decisions about 
 your loan application... 
 ...I have to clarify a few points. 
 Yeah? 
 You only included one tax return, 
 , listing your income... 
 ...as a surgical resident with 
 an annual salary of $  ,   ? 
 Yeah. Before taxes. 
 We'll need your other returns 
 from previous years. 
 There aren't any. Before that, 
 I was a med student. 
 No summer jobs? 
 Well, I... 
 - ... crewed in the Whitbread in     . 
 - Where was that? 
 Capetown. Fremantle. 
 Capsized between Sydney and Auckland. 
 It's a yacht race. 
 And you earned? 
 A few thousand. 
 But after living expenses... 
 I spent more than I made. 
 You're a Resident in emergency 
 medicine now. Is that correct? 
 Yeah. When I shifted from surgery, 
 I agreed to do so without pay. 
 But I'm gonna ask for a paycheck 
 next year, for sure. 
 I would hope so. 
 What about this trust fund? 
 The holdings are in 
 my grandfather's name... 
 ...and I am no longer 
 drawing funds from it. 
 Would he be willing to 
 cosign for your loan? 
 I want my application to be 
 judged on its own merits. 
 - On its own merits, I must reject it. 
 - Why? 
 Either talk to your grandfather... 
 ...or acquaint yourself with 
 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
 - Peter? 
 - Dr. Morgenstern. 
 I looked over your report for the 
 Morbidity and Mortality Conference. 
 It was quite evenhanded. 
 Well, I just charted what happened. 
 Sometimes these things can become 
 so ""he said, she said. "" 
 - There's no need for that. 
 - No, no. 
 Lizzie and I did an aortobifemoral 
 bypass in   hours,    minutes. 
 Well, that's wonderful, Robert. 
 Is M and M still on, or can I buy 
 Lizzie a five-egg omelet? 
 It's still on. 
 Looks like you're not out of 
 the hot seat yet. 
 Will Anspaugh be there? 
 No. He requested that I messenger 
 the meeting notes over to his house. 
 Is the funeral today? 
 - Yeah. 
 - I sent flowers from the department. 
 Well, looks like a cruller 
 and a Coke is all we have time for. 
 My treat! 
 Mark? I'm going to a surgical 
 M and M. Can you cover for an hour? 
 Sure, what's going on? 
 It's the Swanson laparoscopy. 
 Right. Peter's case. 
 It's actually Dr. Morgenstern. 
 Right. Have fun. 
 I'll hold down the fort. 
 I thought you said... 
 - ... he's the best. 
 - He is! 
 He rolled my med school loan into... 
 ...a Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae, Ellie Mae, 
 whatever. 
 All I know is I don't have to eat 
 meals out of a can anymore. 
 - Did you catch that Sox game? 
 - Missed it. 
 Center fielder, pop fly, 
 catching a few z's. Pay up! 
 I'm short right now. 
 Can I get you? 
 Sure. I know you're good for it. 
 My aunt made a k*lling 
 selling Tupperware. 
 - Tupperware? 
 - Those little plastic storage things- 
 - I know what Tupperware is. 
 - How about Amway? 
 - You're really enjoying this. 
 - Yeah, a little. 
 - Heads up, doctors! 
 - Carter, you're up. 
 This day gets better and better, 
 doesn't it? 
 Grabarsky, who do you got? 
 Mike Lembreaux. Doesn't know 
 when to say when. Fell over a curb. 
 A curb? Maybe we should 
 have those removed. 
 His wrist looks pretty bad. 
 Well, from the smell of things, 
 we can skip the pain medication. 
 Let's check out that wrist, 
 Mr. Lembreaux. 
 I wanted to eulogize him somehow, 
 but I... 
 I never felt comfortable 
 in his mother's church. 
 So austere. 
 No pomp and ceremony, just... 
 ...silent judgment. 
 I thought the silence 
 was for contemplation. 
 It's just... 
 Well, you can imagine how 
 her Quaker parents felt... 
 ...when she brought home 
 a West Point man. 
 Well, you ended up getting married. 
 Yeah. 
 The hawk and the dove. 
 Long time ago. 
 Scotty... 
 ...wanted you to have 
 the stuff in this box. 
 Green Day. 
 I'm surprised he didn't burn a hole 
 through this one. 
 - What? 
 - Soap Opera Digest. 
 I knew he was getting those future 
 plots from somewhere. 
 The most important aspect of 
 M and M... 
 ...is not to linger on our missteps... 
 ...but to analyze every case 
 as a teaching tool. 
 Dr. Benton. 
 Thank you. 
 - Gonna need a reduction. 
 - An open reduction. 
 - Internal fixation in the O.R. 
 - Not so fast. You're not in surgery. 
 I got my real ones knocked out 
 in Joliet. 
 He can't breathe! 
 He can't breathe! 
 - I'm showing him something. 
 - Keep breathing on the nebulizer. 
 - Leave this kid alone. 
 - Get him out of here. 
 - Put your teeth back in your mouth. 
 - I can talk to anybody! 
 Take deep breaths. 
 Don't tell me what to do. 
 Leave me alone! 
 Guys, get the soft restraints! 
 Leave me alone! 
 Leave me alone! 
 Stop it! Leave me alone! 
 Please help him! 
 You'll be fine. He's cyanotic! 
 I'm gonna intubate him. 
 - Check his right wrist. 
 - I'm intubating. 
 - Get me    of ketamine. 
 - Forty of ketamine 
 What are you doing bringing 
 a psycho in here? 
 - I didn't realize. 
 - This boy is a critical asthma patient. 
 Nobody cares about Pedes. 
 .  ETtube. 
 - I'm really sorry. 
 - Here we go. Give me suction. 
 Morgenstern's attempt to control the 
 hemorrhage by incision was futile. 
 Bleeding obscured the operative field, 
 but we were controlling it. 
 - It was difficult. 
 - What did you do next? 
 Called for additional suction. 
 Then you decided to change 
 course and open the chest. 
 Who made that incision? 
 I did. 
 Morgenstern allowed you 
 to crack the chest? 
 - Not exactly- 
 - I didn't feel it- 
 Gentlemen, one at a time. 
 Dr. Benton? 
 I took over the surgery. 
 What do you mean, ""take over""? 
 In the heat of the moment, 
 Dr. Benton became agitated. 
 Dr. Benton? 
 I pushed him aside. 
 What was your justification 
 for such an action? 
 The man was bleeding out. 
 The midline incision was adequate. 
 It was the varices. 
 No. He needed 
 to be cracked immediately. 
 And that justifies committing battery? 
 The man was dying. 
 Would you have stood there? 
 I would have assisted the Attending. 
 After three minutes of 
 arterial bleeding... 
 ...cross-clamping the aorta was 
 the only alternative. 
 No, Peter. I don't think it was. 
 No, it was the only alternative! 
 Gentlemen, it's best to adjourn... 
 ...and convene a resident review 
 at   :   to discuss it. 
 I agree. Dr. Morgenstern? 
 Yes. I think that would be for the best. 
 What do we have here? 
 A   -year-old woman,    weeks 
 pregnant, found unconscious. 
 - GCS   , multiple lacs, vitals stable. 
 - Let's go! 
 The Chicago Reproductive Center 
 was bombed. 
 The abortion clinic? 
 They also do prenatal care. They're 
 still pulling people from the rubble. 
 Blowing up clinics. Bastards! 
 - How many we got? 
 - No idea. It's chaos down there. 
 We got a   -year-old, second trimester. 
 Chest pain, shortness of breath. 
 BP's real low,   /  .

 You're at a hospital.

 - Zoe Kearney. A wall fell on her. 
 - How far along is she? 
 - Six months. 
 Clear Trauma  ! 
 We can't release patient 
 information over the phone. 
 The hospital has no official 
 comment at this time. 
 It's the Trib. They want to know 
 if any abortion docs died. 
 They're ""gynecologists. "" 
 We don't have any information. 
 A vanload of protesters with 
 minor injuries came in. 
 Triage them. 
 We're swamped with criticals.

 get to you as soon as they can.

 as soon as we can. 
 Have somebody look at that. 
 - What? 
 - Your head. 
 Thirty-two French. 
 - Urine dip's negative. 
 - Blood gas? 
 PO   . PCO   . 
 PH  .   on    liters. 
 Borderline, but okay. 
 Resps down to   . 
 Fetal heart rate    . 
 No contractions. Mom's    /  . 
 - Where's my boyfriend? 
 - He's outside. 
 Is he okay? 
 - He's fine. Relax. 
 - Still want the blood? 
 Hang a unit of red cells. 
 Get her to CT. 
 - Come on, let's go. Got it? 
 - Yeah. 
 Send her blood to Radiology. 
 - Where's she going? 
 - Taking her to CT. 
 - What's on the scope? 
 - Sinus tach at    . 
 - Let OB know where we're going! 
 - I'm right behind you, okay? 
 Was she in for an abortion 
 or prenatal care? 
 She's   ,    weeks. Kind of 
 late for an AB, don't you think? 
 We've got fetal heart tones,    . 
 CBC, type and cross for four 
 units, and cath a urine. 
 Pulse ox   . BP   /  . 
 Good cap refill. 
 Also get a chest. 
 Shield her abdomen 
 and let's prep her for a pelvic. 
 I've got her chart. Brianna Thomas, 
 -week-pregnant nullip. 
 - In for a suction extraction. 
 - An abortion? 
 Looks like they didn't finish. 
 BP's dropped,   /  . Pulse    . 
 She's hemorrhaging. 
 Complete the AB. 
 Grab a gyn tray. 
 Grab a tray! 
 We need to evacuate the uterus. 
 - Now, doctor. 
 - I can't. 
 Speculum! Betadine! 
 Set suction on high, and get me... 
 ...a size    cannula. Let's go! 
 - Second liter's in. 
 - Hang a third and repeat a crit. 
 Anna? Can I speak to you 
 for a moment? 
 Sure. 
 - Kerry, you want some coffee? 
 - No, thanks. 
 What happened in that trauma today? 
 - I'm sorry. I froze. 
 - That can't happen. 
 I couldn't complete the abortion. 
 - Why not? 
 - I don't know. 
 The fetus was so far along and- 
 What about Brianna Thomas? 
 Your patient was hemorrhaging. 
 I don't know. I didn't ex- 
 The baby had a chance, you know? 
 There are patients and procedures 
 that we might find distasteful- 
 Distasteful? Come on, Kerry, 
 I'm not squeamish. It just felt wrong. 
 We can't allow our feelings 
 to dictate our standard of care. 
 - I don't. 
 - But you did. 
 Your moral objection to abortion- 
 I don't have a moral objection! 
 Well, something happened 
 in there today. 
 I'm his son, Burke. 
 He lives with me. 
 How long has he been wetting the bed? 
 Maybe two days. 
 He smelled pretty bad. 
 - He's had urine infections before. 
 - Right. 
 Temp's    , and he looks dehydrated. 
 We try to get him to eat 
 or drink, but he won't. 
 Let's start a line of normal saline. 
 Give him a     cc bolus. 
 CBC, Chem-  , blood cultures 
 times two, urine CNS. 
 You got it. 
 I don't think that's necessary. 
 Before, they just gave him antibiotics. 
 We need to do a full evaluation. 
 - If you're worried about being sued- 
 - It's nothing to do with being sued. 
 You'll poke him and prod him... 
 ...and then thousands of dollars later, 
 you'll give him antibiotics. 
 Go have a seat while we 
 work on your dad. 
 Unbe-friggin-lievable! 
 Grab a blood gas kit and show 
 Mr. Newton to Chairs. 
 I can show myself. 
 He's a charmer. 
 When's the last time anyone 
 bathed this guy? 
 From the looks of these bedsores, 
 about the same time they turned him. 
 So much for ""honor thy father. "" 
 I don't understand your argument. 
 The decision has been made. 
 Dr. Benton allowed his emotions 
 to get a little out of hand. 
 Otherwise, he's a good resident. 
 Who committed battery. 
 Peter's a good surgeon. 
 But you can't let this stand. 
 Like you said, Dr. Weaver, 
 the decision's been made. 
 Unless you have a problem with it? 
 No. 
 Debra, would you ask Dr. Benton 
 to come in, please? 
 Dr. Benton, we have reviewed 
 Dr. Swanson's chart and the autopsy. 
 I thought the autopsy was inconclusive 
 due to the state of the body. 
 Regardless, this committee feels the 
 matter warrants further investigation. 
 I don't know what to say. Everything 
 I saw and did is in this report. 
 Chart aside, you pushed an Attending. 
 You're out of the rotation 
 pending a formal inquiry. 
 You're suspending me? 
 Until Dr. Anspaugh returns 
 and there's a full investigation. 
 When can I return to my job? 
 We don't know yet. 
 - And this is effective...? 
 - Immediately. 
 She threw three PVCs, unifocal, 
 no R on T. Should I give her lidocaine? 
 Three? No. Let's observe. 
 Her chest tube stopped draining. 
 cc's. 
 Resps are a little high at   . 
 Zoe, we looked at your CT. 
 There's no evidence of organ damage. 
 We still want to 
 admit you for observation. 
 - For how long? 
 - We're not sure. 
 It's kind of hard to breathe. 
 - Pulse ox always   ? 
 - No. It's down. 
 I'm fine. What about the baby? 
 You have fetal heart tones, 
 which means that the baby is alive. 
 As for kicking, you tell me. 
 - We should name him Lucky, huh? 
 - ""Her. "" 
 - I have a feeling. 
 - Do you want to see him or her? 
 - We're gonna do an ultrasound. 
 - Yeah, cool. 
 Zoe, what's wrong? 
 - BP's down to    palp. 
 - Are you in pain? 
 - Pulse ox   ! 
 - She's bradying down! Let's go! 
 Hang on. Step back! 
 Pulse is   . You gotta give us 
 room to work here. 
 Oh, no! No! 
 - Pulmonary embolus? 
 - Probably. 
 - Repeat a gas,.  atropine. 
 - Damn! 
 All right. Start CPR. 
 This one is almost to the bone. 
 I've seen all I need to see. 
 I'll put this paperwork through. 
 Hopefully, we'll get him 
 into an extended care facility. 
 - I'd appreciate it. 
 - I just need you to sign this. 
 I'll run it down to the courthouse. 
 Thank you for taking 
 care of this so quickly. 
 I'd say it was my pleasure, but see 
 how people treat their own parents? 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Carter, what gives? 
 I've been sitting here forever. 
 Your father exhibited 
 textbook signs of neglect. 
 - That's crazy. 
 - He hasn't been bathed for weeks. 
 He's covered in feces. 
 He's got bedsores to the bone. 
 I've recommended that he be placed 
 in an adult-care facility. 
 You don't have any say. 
 I have power of attorney. 
 The hospital has claimed 
 temporary guardianship. 
 Really? Who'll pay? 
 I handle the Medicare. 
 His Medicare payments will be 
 transferred to the facility he's in. 
 Expect to hear from my lawyer. 
 Look forward to it. 
 It feels like there's something in there. 
 With all that glass flying 
 after the expl*si*n... 
 ...I didn't want to take a chance. 
 No, you did the right thing. 
 It's so sad. These extremists... 
 ...blowing up buildings 
 with people inside. 
 It's pretty stupid if the idea 
 is to save lives, huh? 
 Exactly. 
 I marched with Dr. King in the '  s. 
 I thought the world would learn 
 something from him. 
 Yeah. 
 Would you put your chin up here 
 for me, please? 
 Must be hard on you as a doctor, 
 and of course a young woman... 
 ...to know that for every life you save, 
 they're taking one away in that clinic. 
 I don't think about it like that. 
 I don't think a lot of people do. 
 It's like that old poem 
 about the Nazis. 
 You know. First they came 
 for the Jews... 
 ...then for whoever, and when they 
 came to take me- 
 Doctors who perform abortions 
 aren't Nazis. 
 Of course not. 
 But if you sit around while they're 
 taking the children, who's next? 
 All right. I see something in there. 
 I knew I wasn't crazy. 
 Hold real still for me. 
 I got it. 
 Okay. You're all set. 
 If you have any discomfort, 
 you can take some ibuprofen. 
 Use these drops four times a day. 
 Come back tomorrow for a re-check. 
 Thank you. 
 This is some information 
 on our group. 
 We hold strategy meetings 
 every Wednesday. 
 - The address is on- 
 - No, thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, can't forget this. 
 STOP ABORTIONIST GENOCIDE 
 Hey, Miss Martinez! You forgot this. 
 - I thought we felt the same. 
 - No, we don't. 
 You're not a peaceful protester. 
 That sign is a call to arms. 
 The bomber saw it, or one like it. 
 It's reality. If it upsets you, 
 then it's done its job. 
 The only job it's done is to encourage 
 v*olence. And, yes, that upsets me. 
 She was okay before. 
 She was fine. She was talking. 
 She had a clot in her lung. 
 It deprived her brain of oxygen. 
 There's no way to predict 
 it would happen. 
 Are you sure? 
 We're gonna do an EEG 
 and a brain scan to confirm it. 
 So she's in a coma? 
 It's like a coma, yeah. Yes. 
 People come out of comas. 
 Not when the brain has been deprived 
 of oxygen as long as Zoe's has, no. 
 What about the baby? 
 The baby appears to be fine. 
 Can you save her? 
 Probably. I think so, yeah. 
 And it's a girl? 
 Yes. 
 You hear that, Zoe? 
 You were right. 
 It's a girl. 
 - Wanted to talk to you before I left. 
 - Aren't you on till  ? 
 - No. I've been suspended. 
 - You're not serious? 
 - Yeah, well, I wish I wasn't. 
 - We need help here, now! 
 I'll call you later, okay? 
 What have we got? 
 She's my trainee. She got crushed 
 underneath some unstable debris. 
 - We took care of all the traumas. 
 - People were trapped underneath. 
 BP    palp. Pulse     and thready. 
 IV's infiltrated, poor cap refill. 
 - Dr. Corday? 
 - Oh, my God! Allison! 
 - Clear Trauma  ! EBL on scene? 
 - Half a liter. 
 Hope you didn't mess up 
 my beautiful graft. 
 - We need X-ray in here now. 
 - Blood bank on their way. 
 A   -year-old custodian. 
 Multiple lacs to the chest and back. 
 BP's   /  . Pulse thready at    . 
 Sir, are you with us? 
 - Peter? 
 - I'm on my way home. 
 - Very funny. 
 - I'm not joking. I've been suspended. 
 Not by me you haven't. I need you! 
 All right. 
 Let's get   sh**t O-neg. Call 
 the trauma team, we're on our way. 
 All right, let's roll him. 
 Open pneumothorax. Let's tube him. 
 Damn it. We got a pumper! 
 - No pulse! 
 - All right. Start CPR. 
 We need to crack him. 
 Thoracotomy tray. 
 - Cricoid pressure? 
 - Here's your    blade. 
 A  .  ET tube. Let's go. 
 - Suction. 
 - There it is. 
 Dramatic aortic dissection 
 and rupture. 
 I'm in! Hyperventilate him. 
 Can you get the Satinsky in? 
 No. I'm sticking my finger in. 
 Don't let go. 
 You stopped the bleeding. 
 - I'm holding CPR. Carotid pulse? 
 - Faint. 
 Pump in more O-neg. 
 Get him upstairs. 
 Malik, you stay with us. 
 Keep bagging him. 
 Let's go, people! 
 Go, go, go! 
 Alert the bypass team. 
 You set the pace. 
 We're following you. 
 Watch that IV. Call the O.R., 
 tell them we're coming! 
 Dr. Benton, I thought 
 you understood- 
 Not now. 
 He's tamponing an aortic tear. 
 - Don't jostle the gurney. 
 - Carry on. 
 All right, hit five. 
 - We need four units O-neg. 
 - What's up, Lizzie? 
 Decreased breath, 
 hyper-resonant, hemopneumo. 
 I got the chest tube. 
 Can we give her morphine? 
 - Check the BP first. 
 - It hurts! 
 You've got rib fractures. 
 Try not to talk. 
 Where have I heard that before? 
 Thora-Seal's filling. 
 We need an abdominal CT. 
 She's unstable. 
 Do a peritoneal lavage. 
 Type and cross for eight. 
 Pulse ox is down,   . 
 Here's the O-neg. 
 You want me to do it? 
 No. You do it. 
 Okay. 
 Hey... 
 Hi. I'm sorry to wake you up. 
 I was just resting my eyes. 
 I brought you juice and a sandwich. 
 I figured you'd be hungry. 
 Thanks. 
 You feeling okay? 
 Fine, considering. 
 Were you my doctor? 
 No. That was Dr. Weaver. 
 Two docs, no waiting, huh? 
 My boyfriend brought my clothes. 
 I'll give you your bed back. 
 - Are you feeling well enough to go? 
 - Like I said, I'm fine. 
 I'd just rather be at home. If you 
 don't mind, I'm gonna get changed. 
 Okay. Sure. 
 Sorry. 
 Doctor? 
 Hi, Mr. Newton. How are you feeling? 
 I'm tired. 
 That's from the dehydration. 
 Malnutrition, mostly. 
 Where... Where's... 
 Where's Burke? 
 He left. 
 He deals with the paperwork. 
 Your son is no longer your guardian. 
 For the time being, I am. 
 Why? What? 
 The elder abuse unit is filing 
 paperwork to put you into a home. 
 But I have a home. 
 You have some very serious 
 medical problems... 
 ...resulting from what we believe 
 is very serious neglect. 
 I'm    years old. 
 I've slept in the same bed... 
 ...for    years now. 
 I'm just trying to help you. 
 I want to die in my own bed. 
 You're not sterile. Go scrub. 
 I'm not letting go. Get    units 
 packed cells. Let's move. 
 Okay, people, 
 on my count. One, two, three. 
 Move this gurney. 
 Mark, help me roll him. 
 Open the instrument tray. 
 - No one's gloved and gowned. 
 - Just do it. 
 Get gloves, gowns, masks 
 and caps in here now. 
 - Okay,    blade. 
 - Get him a mask. 
 Tonsil sucker. 
 All right. I'm gonna mobilize 
 the aorta. Metz! 
 - Let's move, let's move. Come on. 
 - What's going on? 
 Peter's got his hand on 
 this man's aorta. 
 Potts' clamp. 
 I'll do a revised clamp-and-run. 
 Got a second Potts? 
 Stand by. 
 Got it. 
 Take your finger out now. 
 - Set up the Bovie. 
 - Pulse is stronger. 
 Okay, let's go for a BP. 
 .  Prolene on a vascular needle. 
 Here we go. 
 Suction, please. 
 Somebody Hoover that. 
 Systolic's up to   . 
 Terrific. 
 Okay, we can take over now. 
 Bovie, please. 
 A   , please. Keep them coming. 
 Retractor and Bovie. Four-by-four 
 and a sponge stick, please. 
 Cut that. 
 Good, good, good. 
 A   , keep them coming. 
 It's looking very good, very good. 
 - Oh, sweet Jesus! 
 - There's gotta be another test. 
 - My angel, sweetheart. 
 - What's he doing here? 
 - He was with her during the bombing. 
 - I bet he was. 
 - We were getting a checkup. 
 - You k*lled my daughter. 
 Proud of yourself? 
 If she'd stayed with you, 
 she would've k*lled herself. 
 Calm down. 
 He needs to get the hell out of 
 my daughter's room. 
 I love her. 
 You guys treated her like crap. 
 We're calling an OB consult. 
 Come with me. 
 Give them some time alone. 
 All right? Come on. 
 Here we go. Come on. 
 She's been in asystole for    minutes. 
 - Another   of epi. 
 - You already had   . 
 - We got a response. 
 - Two beats is not a response. 
 - Start an epinephrine drip. 
 - And a heart transplant too? 
 Stop being such a prick. 
 Get me two units of packed cells! 
 - Dr. Weaver? 
 - Yes. 
 I wanted to say thanks 
 for all you did. 
 The abortion and all. 
 Right. You're welcome. 
 It's the most memorable one 
 I ever got. 
 - You've had others? 
 - A few. 
 I thought Earl would want this baby. 
 Like he'd get serious about us, 
 but he hit the roof. 
 Our clinic can advise you on 
 family planning. 
 Earl doesn't like that stuff. 
 Pills make me fat. 
 There are preferable forms of 
 birth control than abortion. 
 Why are you being such a bitch? 
 Because you're being irresponsible. 
 More likely, it's because you 
 don't get any yourself. 
 It's a very difficult decision. 
 Neither of which will bring Zoe back. 
 It's true. But if the decision is 
 to keep the baby... 
 ...you have two options: The first is 
 we perform an emergency C-section. 
 We deliver a very premature baby, 
 and we take Zoe off the respirator. 
 The baby would have to go in 
 an incubator, right? 
 That's right. Probably months of 
 intensive care. 
 What's the other option? 
 The other option is that we 
 keep Zoe on life support... 
 ...until we can deliver 
 the baby full-term. 
 And what do you recommend? 
 I recommend the later delivery. 
 You're suggesting that our daughter... 
 ...be made into a human incubator. 
 Even though she has no 
 chance of recovery. 
 It's the baby's best chance. 
 I don't want to see Zoe left lying 
 there like some kind of vessel. 
 She wanted this baby more 
 than anything in the world. 
 You have no say in this matter. 
 I'm the baby's father. 
 I'm Zoe's father, 
 and you and she are minors. 
 The decision... 
 ...is mine and her mother's. 
 They can't do this, can they? 
 I'm sorry it took us so long 
 to get to you. 
 I understand. 
 I was just really freaked out. 
 It's not every day the room 
 you're in explodes. 
 Understandable. Okay. You're all set. 
 Keep it elevated and dry, and come 
 back in two days for a re-check. 
 - Okay? 
 - Yeah. 
 You left your insurance form blank. 
 Yeah. I left my card at home. 
 - Can you call someone to get it? 
 - No, I'll pay cash. 
 That's not necessary. 
 Your insurance will cover this. 
 No, I know. 
 I just... 
 ...don't want my husband to know 
 I was at the clinic. 
 I thought I was too old for 
 this kind of thing to happen. 
 Then I started to puke up 
 corn flakes every morning. 
 Now I have to find a new clinic. 
 Preferably one that is not ticking. 
 - You haven't had the abortion? 
 - No. 
 And if my husband finds out, 
 he just won't have the heart. 
 Our youngest daughter's in college. 
 He put all four kids through college. 
 He worked five years 
 past his retirement... 
 ...to be able to pay for it. 
 I've never kept anything 
 from him, but- 
 What if you told him 
 what you told me? 
 I can't. I'd love to... 
 ...but I can't. 
 Anyway, what do I owe you? 
 Don't worry. 
 Bring your card tomorrow. 
 I could leave a license 
 or something as collateral. 
 - It's all right. I trust you. 
 - Thanks. 
 If anybody asks... 
 ...you can get a laceration 
 like that from a dog bite. 
 Have you seen Corday? 
 She's still in O.R. 
 with Beaumont. 
 Okay, thanks. 
 She made it, huh? 
 What's wrong? You okay? 
 Yeah. 
 It was scary. 
 You can put them back together, 
 but you can't keep them that way. 
 Scotty always had such 
 great school spirit. 
 I think I can speak for 
 the whole team when I say... 
 ...we're really going to miss him. 
 I was gonna sing a hymn. 
 But as I'm sitting here, 
 thinking of Scott... 
 ...there's a song that he loved. 
 And it'll always remind me of him. 
 Zadro, I fancy seeing you 
 on the surgical floor. 
 I wanted to tell you, we appreciate 
 what you did for Allison. 
 She's a fighter. 
 With a damn good guardian angel. 
 Lizzie... 
 ...I want to apologize for when I 
 spoke during the Beaumont surgery. 
 I know that she means a lot to you. 
 I just hope you forgive me. 
 Of course. It's been 
 a crazy day for all of us. 
 I get off in about an hour. 
 Do you want to get a drink? 
 Decompress? 
 Look, I'm knackered. 
 Any other day. Okay? 
 I understand. If you change your 
 mind, you have my number. 
 Yes, I do. 
 David? 
 I forgot what this place 
 was all about. 
 The teamwork. 
 The well-oiled machine. 
 What? 
 I've let this situation get 
 completely out of hand. 
 I told myself the varices 
 were too friable. 
 That my field was obscured. 
 That I was protecting 
 Dr. Swanson's dignity. I wasn't. 
 I was covering my own ass. 
 Look, if you make a mistake, 
 that's all that it is. 
 No. No. 
 It's more than that. 
 What are you watching? 
 What am I not watching? 
 That's the question. 
 This is the tape of Swanson's 
 laparoscopy. 
 Where did you get it? 
 I took it right after the surgery. 
 I've been too chicken to look at it. 
 I guess I thought we could 
 avoid a confrontation. 
 A resident can take a note 
 in his file, right? 
 Peter's got so much less 
 to lose than- 
 I can toss this right now. 
 No one would be the wiser. 
 You wouldn't have called me if 
 that's what you were going to do. 
 Jeanie? 
 I wondered where you'd gotten to. 
 I'm just sitting in here. 
 It's very peaceful. 
 Yes, it is. 
 When Scotty was going through 
 the worst of it... 
 ...I went into his room. 
 Found his journal. 
 I know I shouldn't have 
 looked at it... 
 ...but I wanted to understand him... 
 ...the way you and his mother 
 seemed to. 
 He loved you very much. 
 He said, ""Jeanie just gets it. 
 I don't have to explain anything to her, 
 because she already knows. "" 
 That's very sweet. 
 He told me what he wanted to be 
 when he grew up. 
 Some kind of rock 'n' roll star, 
 probably. 
 He wanted to join the Army. 
 He did? 
 I paged OB. They'll send somebody 
 to discuss your options. 
 We've decided to keep the baby 
 and wait until it's closer to term. 
 Good, I'm glad. 
 Donny will be glad too. 
 This is no longer 
 any of Donny's business. 
 Give it a little more time. 
 I've contacted our attorney. My wife 
 and I are filing for sole custody. 
 Is this to teach Donny a lesson? 
 Nothing could teach him 
 what he deserves. 
 I've seen parents twice his age... 
 ...who weren't responsible 
 enough to seek care. 
 Responsible? Getting 
 a   -year-old girl pregnant. 
 Forcing her to leave home. 
 Drop out of school- 
 - Please, Miles. 
 - No. 
 - The doctor thinks he's an expert. 
 - No, it's just- 
 It's just what's best for the child. 
 We let Donny into our lives once 
 and he took our daughter away. 
 He's not gonna 
 take our granddaughter. 
 - I don't want to go. 
 - Everything will be fine. 
 This is for the best. 
 I'm not sure it is. 
 You filed a legal report. 
 You can't rescind that. 
 I want to go home. 
 I want to go home. 
 If you won't listen to me, 
 listen to him. 
 Someone being abused can't always 
 determine the best course of action. 
 This isn't a hypothetical. 
 This is an adult human being who's 
 deciding to go home. 
 Your report said he was 
 non compos mentis. 
 He was severely dehydrated. 
 Once we ran fluids in him, 
 he's become lucid. 
 Mr. Newton, I know you're scared. 
 But I'm scared about what's going to 
 happen to you if you're not cared for. 
 I'm fine. Dr. Carter, 
 call Burke. He'll explain. 
 Don't force me to get 
 the police involved... 
 ...and press charges against your 
 son and daughter-in-law. 
 Can she do that? 
 - Please don't let her do that. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 Don't let her do that! 
 - I'm sorry! 
 - I want to go home! 
 Kerry. 
 Anna. 
 What happened today, it threw me. 
 It's been on my mind. 
 - I wanted to talk to you about it. 
 - Same here. 
 I should have explained myself better 
 instead of flying off the handle. 
 - You were right. 
 - No, just let me explain. 
 I did some overseas work in Africa 
 where abortion is illegal. 
 And I saw   -year-old girls 
 in septic shock... 
 ...from botched procedures. 
 And there was nothing we could do. 
 I've made it a priority to be 
 the best doctor I can be... 
 ...and to support all 
 my patients' choices. 
 If you had asked me when I 
 got up this morning... 
 ...I would've said the same thing. 
 But in this case, 
 she was so far along. 
 What if another Brianna Thomas 
 comes in? 
 I'd love to be able to tell you that 
 if the same case came in tomorrow... 
 ...I'd do the procedure without 
 a second thought, but I don't know. 
 Peter, I'm glad I caught you. 
 I was on my way to your apartment. 
 I'm sorry about that surgery, 
 but I already had my hand in there. 
 No, you did the right thing. 
 You were thinking on your feet. 
 That's not what I want to talk about. 
 I wanted to let you know that one of my 
 last two acts as Chief of Surgery... 
 ...is to rescind your suspension. 
 What do you mean? 
 That's Swanson's laparoscopy 
 in full living color. 
 The mistake wasn't yours. 
 I cut the gastric artery. 
 My last act as chief will be to resign. 
 - It was just one incident. 
 - No. 
 When I saw you in that trauma today, 
 the passion that you exhibited... 
 ...it's been years since I felt that. 
 It might have something to do with 
 my heart attack. The pressure... 
 ...of feeling that I just 
 don't belong here anymore. 
 What do you mean? 
 You're a great surgeon. 
 You taught me everything I know. 
 I was a great surgeon. 
 But what happened... 
 ...what I allowed to happen... 
 ...it just proves that I'm not 
 a very great man. 
 That's what I gotta work on. 
 Here. 
 - You smell that? 
 - What's that? 
 The smell of spring. 
 All green, and full of possibility. 
 Ramen Delight. You feeling suicidal? 
 No, I'm just poor. 
 John Truman Carter, poor? 
 It's a long story. 
 I've had a bit of a long week. 
 I overdid it with a patient. 
 Thought I was doing what was best. 
 Better to overdo it and be wrong, 
 than not do anything at all. 
 I'll tell you what. 
 Dump that liquid sodium 
 and I'll buy you a burger and a beer. 
 - I don't know. 
 - Come on. It's not an option. 
 - Hey, guys. 
 - Hey, Jeanie. 
 Is it still raining? 
 It's not so bad. 
 It's kind of nice, actually. 
 Peter? 
 I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
 Come on in. 
 I'll turn the music down. 
 - Let me take that. 
 - Oh... 
 Here, look, you're soaking wet. 
 Yeah. Cheap umbrella. 
 What possessed you to 
 come out in these elements? 
 My day, my week, my life. 
 I heard about Morgenstern. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 I lost my mentor today. 
 And the hospital... 
 ...they lost a great surgeon. 
 You can be so close to somebody... 
 ...and then they're gone. 
 And you've never even told them 
 that you- You know, how... 
 What you- 
 I'm sorry, I'm babbling.

er_5_7,108757,5,7,"Previously on ER: 
 - Someone's down! 
 - We have to wait for a secure area. 
 We should not be out here! 
 I thought you smoothed things 
 between ER and paramedics? 
 You're my new intern. 
 I just gave you an order. 
 I wasn't aware Reece had 
 a hearing problem. 
 My son is my business. 
 And I'm not interested in continuing 
 as Interim Chief. 
 Beard is stuck! 
 I wouldn't have asked if you had 
 told me what you were doing. 
 Sorry you thought it was 
 your business to ask me. 
 Carter? What are you doing here? 
 Hey! Morning, Carter. 
 That's Grace Jones. 
 Hey, I didn't wake you up, did I? 
 I mean, you're on at  . 
 Yeah. But no problem. 
 Good. You settling in down there? 
 Yes, I like it. 
 You have a very interesting 
 CD collection. 
 What? 
 I said, you have 
 a very eclectic CD collection! 
 Thanks. 
 Anything you want to listen to, 
 just ask. 
 Don't ever touch it on your own, 
 though. 
 I've rented to a lot of students, 
 so I had to make that a rule. 
 Carter, let me make you one 
 of these, man. 
 It'll slingshot you into your day. 
 You're in a really good mood. 
 I'm just so glad to be 
 percent focused on medicine. 
 - Hey, can I ask you something? 
 - Sure. 
 Do you find it easy to evaluate 
 other people's work? 
 Time to grade your student? 
 I worry about being too harsh. 
 Does she deserve to be judged harshly? 
 I want to be fair. 
 Lucy hasn't gotten off 
 to a great start this year, clearly. 
 But she's smart and 
 she's willing to work hard. 
 Maybe I should go easy, give her 
 a chance to turn things around. 
 Go on. Keep talking. 
 A stripper? 
 I said, ""Damn! Can't you cover that 
 up?"" She was destroying the magic. 
 I thought I'd ride along this morning. 
 It's more fun than the hospital, 
 isn't it? 
 He likes it on the frontlines, 
 or we need closer supervision. 
 - Somebody's gotta keep an eye on you. 
 - Hey, doc. Here! 
 By the way, can I crash here tonight? 
 My building's being fumigated. 
 Have to ask the captain. 
 Shouldn't be a problem. 
 You can sleep on a Barcalounger. 
 I've done that. 
 Who paged me? 
 I got an   -year-old man 
 with cholangitis for you. 
 I stopped taking admits at  :  . 
 Why didn't you page the on-call team? 
 He came in while you were on call. 
 Dr. Romano specifically asked for you. 
 - How sick is he? 
 - He's septic, intubated... 
 ...hypotensive and in renal... 
 - No, no! This can't be happening. 
 Look, I haven't had a nap in the last 
 hours. Rounds are starting. 
 I have to take a shower, 
 I smell bad. 
 And you give me a patient 
 sick as a dog? 
 What does that say? 
 What does that say?  :  ! 
 I'm not on call! 
 He's in Curtain  . 
 We've all been there. 
 Shut up. 
 - Tony Broadway? 
 - That a great porn star name, or what? 
 - Carol, want to know your porno name? 
 - What? 
 Take your middle name 
 and the street you live on. 
 Like, mine would be Anthony Broadway. 
 Tony Broadway. 
 You're mixed up. That's your 
 romance novelist's name. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - Your porno name is your pet name... 
 ...with your mother's maiden name. 
 My name would be Nibbles McGee. 
 Nibbles. That's a great porno name. 
 Mine would be Fluffy Florez. 
 If you don't have a pet? 
 - Use one you had as a kid. 
 - Nibbles is a great name. 
 I don't think that's right. 
 - What would yours be? 
 - Mine wouldn't work. 
 Have we gotten a package 
 from Lakeside Supply? 
 - This early? 
 - It's supposed to arrive overnight. 
 Tell me when it's here. 
 Kerry, have you got a minute? 
 We need to prepare 
 these Attending schedules. 
 I'm not familiar with 
 the computer down here. 
 It's a snap. Jerry can take 
 you through it. 
 - Can you give me a hand? 
 - I got a lot of patients. 
 Dr. Anspaugh, got a woman 
 complaining about her bill. 
 She was charged for procedures 
 not done. 
 Why are you telling me? 
 Those calls go to 
 the Chief of Emergency. 
 Or the Interim Chief. 
 Tell her you'll pull her chart 
 and call her within two days. 
 I don't know how I'm supposed 
 to learn in this environment. 
 Our relationship has turned 
 adversarial... 
 ...and it's not good for the patients. 
 Dr. Carter, we need to talk. 
 Hey, Lucy. Is everything all right? 
 You're talking to yourself. 
 Not a bad thing... 
 Actually, do you think I should 
 sit down and talk to Dr. Carter? 
 Depends on how direct you want to be. 
 You don't want to be confrontational. 
 - You don't want him to be defensive. 
 - Right. 
 I'd do it over a meal. 
 Oh, like a chat. I like that. 
 Makes sense. 
 Oh, damn! 
 Hey, Lucy? 
 Could you get me a tampon 
 from the thingy? 
 Oh, I got one here. 
 Damn it. 
 - There you go. 
 - Thanks a lot. 
 Peter, sorry I'm late. 
 I was in the ER with an admission 
 you need to see. 
 - The problem? 
 -   -year-old male... 
 ...septic, with cholangitis. 
 He's on mezlo and Flagyl. 
 I got his pressure up with dopamine. 
 He's too sick for open surgery. 
 We'll do a decompression. 
 - I booked the O.R. 
 - Busy night last night? 
 Oh, God, horrible! 
 Twelve admissions, plus this one. 
 I got an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 
 s*ab wound to the chest... 
 ...fall from a second-story balcony. 
 They just kept coming. 
 I worked   -hour shifts 
 as an intern in England. 
 This makes me realize 
 how long ago that was. 
 I'll take him down, 
 and we'll round at  , okay? 
 Lovely. Gives me enough time 
 for prerounds... 
 ...and a shower. 
 You know, I bumped into 
 David Kotlowitz an hour ago. 
 He's a terrific ENT. 
 He's done a lot of work 
 with cochlear implants. 
 Did you tell him about Reece? 
 No, I just told him I had a friend 
 in need of talk on the subject. 
 Don't solicit medical advice 
 on my behalf, all right? 
 I worked with Kotlowitz. 
 That's why I brought it up. 
 - Lf you'd rather I hadn't... 
 - Yeah. 
 Fine, forget about it. 
 - What is that? A sternal saw? 
 - Yes, it is. 
 - What's it doing here? 
 - My midline thoracotomy proposal... 
 ...sailed through 
 the Human Subjects Committee. 
 Nobody told me. 
 Well, I'm certified to use it, 
 so we're up and running. 
 I thought we'd talk 
 before it got underway. 
 Surgeons use it on odd days... 
 ...ER docs get it on evens. 
 Your turn's tomorrow. 
 Hey, bad news. 
 We're still not pregnant. 
 We'll redouble our efforts. 
 If it's more 
 than three times a week... 
 ...we get diminishing returns. 
 Like reusing the same tea bag. 
 - There's a romantic idea. 
 - Wasn't very romantic, was it? 
 Doug? 
 I've got a lethargic infant 
 not eating. You better come see him. 
 - You okay? 
 - Yeah. 
 Baby's name is Sun? Korean? 
 Actually, it's Sun. 
 His mom's a little different. 
 All right, Mrs. Everly. I'm Dr. Ross. 
 Can I take a look at Sun? 
 I don't know what's wrong. 
 He won't nurse. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 Hey, you his big sister? 
 What's your name? 
 - Sky. Hello, doctor. 
 - Well, hello, Sky. 
 Sun and Sky, huh? 
 He was fine until a few days ago. 
 Then I noticed he wasn't nursing 
 so well. 
 - Any solid foods or formula? 
 - Oh, no. Only my milk. 
 My breasts are engorged 
 with him not eating. 
 When was the last time he pooped? 
 - Oh, man. When? 
 - Yesterday morning. 
 - You sure? 
 - Yes, I haven't changed him since. 
 We'll hydrate him. Give him 
 cc's of D  saline. 
 We'll have to do blood tests. 
 And I need your consent 
 to do a spinal tap. 
 You stick a needle into his spine? 
 Won't that hurt? 
 We'll sedate him, no pain. 
 - Mom, it's gonna be okay. 
 - Do you think so, honey? 
 We'll be right back, okay? 
 Get a CBC, Chem-   and blood cultures. 
 Can you assist with the LP? 
 Sure, how do you sedate him? 
 Propafol. 
 I'll get it from Pedes. 
 General anesthesia? 
 Have we done that in the ER? 
 First time for everything. 
 I'll take the proper precautions. 
 Yelling doesn't help! 
 There's an ambulance out front. 
 - Thank God! 
 - Don't open that door. 
 Get away from me! 
 - Come on! 
 - Get away from me! Don't touch me! 
 - Yes, hello. 
 - We got a     call. 
 - I called. 
 - She shouldn't have called. 
 Get in here! 
 - Where's the injured man? 
 - This is not an emergency. 
 Everything's fine. 
 I don't need the hospital. 
 - Your name? 
 - Richard Weingarten. 
 He let this lunatic drill 
 a hole in his head. 
 I'm an emergency physician. 
 Let me take a look. 
 - I'm all right. 
 - Okay, just sit down here. Sit down. 
 What are you ashamed of? 
 - What happened? 
 - It's called trepanation. 
 It's a centuries-old practice, a means 
 of increasing brain blood volume. 
 - I had mine done in Amsterdam in     . 
 - Oh, God! 
 It was like God lifted 
 a weight from me. 
 It's a surgical drill. 
 We're going to the hospital. 
 You can't take me against my will. 
 I've studied this for years. 
 I didn't embark on it lightly. 
 Let us at least put a bandage on 
 and get a blood pressure. 
 Okay, sir, just sign this. 
 It says you refuse treatment. 
 Go to the rig and get some saline. 
 - Come on, Rich. We did it. 
 - The Internet! 
 That's what started this whole thing! 
 - Laura! 
 - I hate it! 
 - Get her outside. 
 - I hate it! 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Outside! 
 - I don't want to go! 
 - Calm down! 
 I'll have you brought up on charges. 
 I want to go back inside! 
 You're an intelligent person. 
 I don't want to take you 
 against your will. 
 I had to do something. 
 All right. Okay. 
 Doesn't look like you 
 penetrated the dura. 
 All I want to do is put a sterile 
 dressing on to clean the wound. 
 I'll leave you some saline 
 and gauze so you... 
 ...or your friend, can keep it clean. 
 I forgot to bring any gauze. 
 I've held enough screaming 
 babies to know. 
 They have to be sedated. 
 Doug? 
 How you doing? 
 You can't administer propafol 
 to an infant. 
 You've done it upstairs for    years. 
 You're not an anesthesiologist. 
 I didn't think you'd have a problem. 
 Well, I do. 
 I have him on a cardiac monitor, 
 pulse ox, dynamap... 
 ...and a crash cart. 
 You cannot just make up policy 
 as you go along. 
 I'm trying to prevent pain, 
 do what's best for this boy. 
 If you want to discuss policy, leave. 
 We'll do it later. 
 We will. 
 Dr. Carter, want to grab lunch later? 
 Let's see. Tell me about 
 this patient in Curtain  . 
 Thirty-year-old male with pain 
 on urination. 
 - The UA is negative for white cells. 
 - Chlamydia. 
 Do a sexual history? 
 He had two partners last year, 
 and used condoms. 
 So he claims. Send up a DNA probe 
 and treat empirically. 
 Treatment for chlamydia? 
 Doxycycline BID, 
 or a dose of Zithromax. 
 You should look at his chart... 
 - Hi, I'm Dr. Carter. 
 - Hey. 
 I need to ask, 
 do you always use condoms? 
 Pretty much, yeah. 
 There's times where you haven't? 
 Once or twice maybe, yeah. 
 That's all it takes. 
 We're gonna give you antibiotics. 
 I think you have a common 
 infection called chlamydia. 
 What, VD? 
 Sexually transmitted disease, yes. 
 She doesn't think so. 
 He also had conjunctivitis and 
 arthralgias at the knee and ankle. 
 Mr. Bussey, excuse us for a moment. 
 He was in Mexico and had diarrhea. 
 The timing and symptoms 
 are classic for Reiter's. 
 - You could've included that. 
 - You cut me off. 
 - You could've said, ""Reiter's."" 
 - I didn't get a word in. You... 
 - I'm always doing what? 
 - Like now, you're defensive. 
 You don't even hear me. 
 So, what's the treatment 
 for Reiter's Syndrome? 
 Indomethacin. 
 - We can still send off for chlamydia... 
 - No, you're right. It's Reiter's. 
 Good pickup, Lucy. 
 Propafol is ideal for use in the ER. 
 First of all, onset is immediate, 
 and it wears off in... 
 Don't you think a doctor 
 should be trained? 
 Got a g*nsh*t to the chest coming. 
 The saw is sterilized in Trauma  . 
 We need to be ready 
 if this guy qualifies. 
 You'll document    critical times. 
 Clock starts when? 
 Soon as the patient enters. 
 Don't they need to have 
 cardiac arrest? He sounded okay. 
 Patients can deteriorate en route. 
 Forty-six-year-old man shot 
 with a BB g*n. 
 - Hemodynamically stable. 
 - A BB g*n? 
 The punk who shot me needs to be 
 put under the jail. 
 Ten years old or not. 
 Let me up off of this, I can walk. 
 - Let him go. 
 - Doesn't need a thoracotomy. 
 - No, a tetanus shot and a Band-Aid. 
 - You can follow me, sir. 
 - Want to turn around, or can we hang? 
 - No, take    minutes. 
 Hey, Carol. What's going on? 
 Just doing a quick blood draw. 
 So how's the clinic going today? 
 Oh, I just love prenatal days. 
 Takes me back to my OB roots. 
 Why don't you let a nurse do that? 
 Because I was trying to be discreet. 
 Let me do it. It's kind of hard 
 to stick yourself. 
 Thanks. 
 What labs you need? 
 Just a CBC, check if I'm anemic. 
 Oh, I only ask 
 because if you'd like... 
 ...I can run the results through 
 the clinic. Be more private. 
 That's a great idea. 
 What I'd really like is 
 to check my hormone levels. 
 Oh, okay. Infertility workup? 
 - I don't want to discuss details. 
 - I wasn't trying to... 
 It'd be great if you 
 run it through the clinic. 
 - Okay. 
 - Thanks. 
 Mark, glad I caught you. 
 I've had to move my surgical schedule. 
 Dr. Lee's interview is pushed to  :  . 
 - Is that a problem? 
 - No, that's fine. 
 - Have you looked at her CV? 
 - Impressive. 
 If she's half as impressive in person, 
 she might be our next Chief. 
 And not a moment too soon. 
 Dr. Greene, I didn't think you 
 were gonna be around. 
 I was on a paramedic ride-along, 
 and we brought in a patient. 
 So, you finish your student 
 evaluation yet? 
 I thought I had till the shift ends? 
 No big deal, this afternoon's fine. 
 I wrote an evaluation for Lucy... 
 ...but I tore it up because 
 I want to be fair. 
 You put something on paper 
 that'll impact her life. 
 Just evaluate her work. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm talking about your porn-star name. 
 Take your pet's name 
 and your mother's maiden name. 
 - Try it. Like mine is Rex Voytek. 
 - Oh, I know that game. 
 But it's your drag name, not porn. 
 - Drag name? 
 - Yeah, the name of your pet... 
 ...and the street you're born on. 
 - I don't think so. 
 RuPaul had it on her show. 
 Leave some crumbs for the rest of us. 
 - Are you the cookie police? 
 - Have some... 
 ...but I brought those for 
 the docs and nurses. 
 - So you're the cookie fairy. 
 - Wait a minute. 
 - Don't worry. 
 - Bad enough you raid... 
 ...the icebox, now you 
 want to call names? 
 Conni, you begrudge us some juice? 
 It's not like you bring anything in. 
 You should thank me for the cookie 
 I keep from your fat snack hole. 
 You just keep talking, Morales. 
 - Hey, what's going on? 
 - That one's got a problem. 
 - You antagonizing them? 
 - He called Yosh a fairy. 
 I called him the cookie fairy. 
 It was a dumb joke. 
 A real dumb joke. 
 Ready to head back? 
 Yeah, let's go. 
 I got no problem with him 
 being a bone-smoker. 
 I was joking like I would 
 with anybody. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Write the discharge orders soon. 
 - Bed Control likes them by    noon. 
 - Yes, I am aware of that. 
 I told you I'd have a hard time 
 seeing you as my intern. 
 It's complicated for a lot of reasons. 
 Dr. Corday, Mr. Frybush's 
 creatinine is much higher. 
 Thank you. 
 Shall we call a renal consult? 
 Yeah, this guy needs dialysis. 
 - So did you ever get that shower? 
 - No, can you tell? 
 Well, go ahead. I'll cover SICU. 
 - I don't want special treatment. 
 - Turning down a shower? 
 - I've got a lot of work. 
 - Okay, have it your way. 
 Gotta go find Weaver. 
 She's itching to use that saw. 
 Going to the roach coach. 
 Want something? 
 Yes, a triple espresso. 
 Thank you, Kit. 
 Elizabeth? 
 How would you like to scrub in 
 on a bilateral adrenalectomy? 
 Oh, I appreciate the offer, 
 but I'm postcall. 
 I gotta finish my work, 
 and I have to catch up on sleep. 
 A case like this comes 
 once in a blue moon. 
 I'm up to my neck in ER garbage, 
 but I'm not passing this up. 
 Well, it's been a while since 
 my last adrenalectomy. 
 I'll do right, you do left. 
 I can get Dr. Kennedy to cover 
 your service. 
 Jeanie? The baby's spinal tap 
 came back negative for meningitis. 
 What's going on? 
 A lot. We got to talk to the mom. 
 I'll take Sky out of the room. 
 She doesn't need to hear all this. 
 Good idea. 
 Her mom leans on her a lot, 
 don't you think? 
 - A smart kid, though. 
 - Yeah. 
 Okay. Hey. 
 - What did you find? 
 - Spinal tap was negative. 
 I have more questions. Maybe 
 Jeanie and Sky could take a walk. 
 I don't want to worry 
 about her wandering. 
 I'd rather stay here with Mom. 
 Can she help me put 
 some toys away while you talk? 
 It's a good idea. 
 - Mind helping me? 
 - I don't mind. 
 I'll be right back, Mom. 
 - See what toys we can find. 
 - Sure. 
 Okay, we need to see if 
 we can figure out... 
 ...the cause of Sun's deterioration. 
 - Now, has he had a polio vaccine? 
 - Oh, God, polio! 
 He was vaccinated. Is that effective? 
 Do you have a doll at home? 
 - No. 
 - No, really? 
 I had one. Dolls are for babies. 
 I'm a big girl. 
 - And how old are you? 
 - Six. 
 Six. 
 After the adrenal vein, we'll work 
 our way around the medial... 
 ...and inferior edges of the gland. 
 Cut, please. And another tie. 
 Elizabeth, cut. 
 Elizabeth? 
 Sorry. Yes. 
 You do need a rest. 
 Why don't you step out? 
 No, I'm fine. I'm fine. 
 Go take a nap. 
 Sorry I dragged you along. 
 Dr. Goodman? 
 - Can I run something by you? 
 - Make it quick. 
 Male with aphasia and arm weakness. 
 CT scan was normal. 
 Spinal fluid is clear. 
 I'm thinking vasculitis or MS? 
 Send off a sed rate 
 and a complement level in the CSF. 
 Look at the differential. May be some 
 zebras you haven't considered. 
 Okay. Hey, Yosh, is that 
 Lucy's palmtop? 
 I love this. She let me borrow it. 
 - Can I use it? When you're done. 
 - I'm done. 
 Here you go. 
 - Know how to work it? 
 - Yeah, Lucy showed me once. 
 I'd hoped to avoid this. 
 But things haven't improved. 
 I don't know how I'm supposed to 
 learn in this hostile environment. 
 Our relationship has turned 
 completely adversarial... 
 ... and it's not good 
 for the patients. 
 We need to talk. 
 This crazy bastard lets Dr. Greene... 
 ...Iook inside the hole 
 with a penlight. 
 - Unbelievable! 
 - I thought I'd seen it all. 
 Doc writes him a scrip 
 for antibiotics. 
 The guy thanks us for coming. 
 Yeah, I've got a way 
 with ranting lunatics. 
 - I ain't kidding. You do. 
 - Hey, what's up, guys? 
 - We're all here. 
 - You're not on today. 
 Truth is, they're here because 
 we got you something. 
 You like it? 
 - It's great. 
 - You're one of the g*ng now. 
 - Almost. 
 - Almost? 
 There's something every 
 paramedic does. 
 It's only appropriate 
 that you do too. 
 How many patients have you brought in 
 strapped to a backboard with a collar? 
 What do you have in mind? 
 Come over to the table, 
 we'll show you. 
 As a part of our training, 
 we all get on the board ourselves. 
 You want me to lie on the board. 
 Don't worry. We all did it. 
 - Comes with the coat. 
 - Gotta drop your pants. 
 No, he doesn't! 
 Forget about that part, guys. 
 All right? Forget it. 
 I have to get back to the hospital. 
 Then don't fight. Just lie down. 
 - Come on. 
 - Relax, guys, back off. 
 Let him do it on his own. 
 You want me to lie down. 
 - There. 
 - There you go. 
 Get him! 
 Got the shower on? 
 - Come on, the shower's on! 
 - Get the shower! 
 Stop it! Stop it! 
 Take it easy, doc. 
 Hey, guys, guys. Come on. 
 Let him up. 
 - Let him up. 
 - We weren't gonna hurt you. 
 Much. 
 It's all over for now. 
 Jer, know what your name is 
 as a porn star? 
 That game is tired. 
 - I've got the best, Satan Monroe. 
 - Your mother's maiden name is Satan? 
 - Carol, I need you. 
 - What's wrong? 
 Young woman complains of severe 
 right lower quadrant pain. 
 Pregnancy test positive, 
 a possible ectopic. 
 - Name? 
 - Maria Jones. 
 Five pregnancies. 
 Two live births, two abortions. 
 Hi, Maria. 
 We're gonna take care of you. 
 - It hurts, it hurts! 
 - All right. 
 Let's get a CBC, Beta HCG, Chem-  . 
 Type and cross two units, 
 and start a line of saline. 
 - Did you do a pelvic? 
 - No, she's in too much pain. 
 She said I'm pregnant. 
 Is my baby okay? 
 Okay. 
 Let's do an ultrasound 
 while we're at it. 
 It just hurts so bad! 
 Okay, you're gonna be fine. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 We were just about to start 
 without you. Dr. Lee, Mark Greene. 
 Sorry if I held things up. 
 I'll try not to take it personally. 
 You've been flexible with your time. 
 We appreciate it. 
 - I'm happy to be here. 
 - Let's get right to it. 
 ""Three years as associate chief. 
 Excellence in Clinical Teaching Award 
 two years in a row."" 
 How do you think you can improve 
 our department? 
 You could benefit from an eight-bed 
 observation unit for   -hour stays. 
 Paid for how? 
 We're a cash-poor county hospital. 
 - That's why you need it. 
 - Tell us more. 
 I set up a unit like it in Atlanta. 
 And it saved the hospital $  million 
 a year in unnecessary admissions. 
 What kind of patients 
 are we talking about? 
 - Lucy, take this. 
 - What is it? 
 Your evaluation. 
 It's blank. 
 You fill it out since you think 
 I'm so adversarial. 
 And keep track of this 
 before someone walks away with it. 
 You listened to my notes? 
 You're so sure I'd give you 
 a bad evaluation... 
 ...you're planning a countermove. 
 A hostile workplace? 
 I didn't know it's time 
 for evaluation. 
 Please. Why'd you want to have lunch? 
 To get things out in the open. 
 Well, they're out in the open. 
 Why don't you fill that out, and let's 
 see how fair-minded you can be. 
 - How long will they be upstairs? 
 - Not much longer. 
 What was the name of the doll you had? 
 - Baby. 
 - Was Baby a boy or a girl? 
 She wasn't a boy or a girl. 
 She didn't have a penis or a vag*na. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Letting him lick the spoon. 
 Does your brother lick the spoon? 
 Sometimes, with things that he likes. 
 - Like what? Yogurt? 
 - Sun doesn't like yogurt. 
 - What does he like? 
 - Lots of things. 
 Does he like honey? 
 Your little brother licks honey 
 off of your spoon? 
 - He likes it. 
 - Okay. 
 Sky, let's go find your mom 
 and Dr. Ross, okay? 
 Okay. 
 - I like the observation unit idea. 
 - Good. 
 - Very good presentation. 
 - Thank you. 
 I'd be happy to give you 
 a tour of the ER. 
 I don't need to be hand-held. 
 But I do want to walk around. 
 Feel free. I'll catch up with you. 
 It's a pleasure. 
 - Mark, do you like her? 
 - She's good. 
 You didn't say much. 
 Didn't think you're impressed. 
 I'd like to continue this 
 in a less formal setting. 
 I'll see if she can come for dinner. 
 - Would you be...? 
 - I can't tonight. 
 I'm sorry. Excuse me, Dr. Anspaugh. 
 - Are you feeling better? 
 - A little bit. 
 Going to the bathroom helped, huh? 
 Maybe it was just gas pains. 
 You haven't had any bleeding, 
 which is good. 
 You're further along than we thought. 
 Looks like    weeks. 
 - I wasn't even sure I was pregnant. 
 - Look. 
 Can you tell? Is it a boy or a girl? 
 Can't say for sure. 
 It looks like a girl. 
 After having two boys, that'd be nice. 
 Well, I don't see a penis. 
 You can't always tell 
 on an ultrasound. 
 You'll have to come back... 
 ...make sure she stays healthy. 
 I'll do that. 
 Come on, Corday. 
 Pull yourself together. 
 It's just a few more hours to go. 
 Elizabeth, can you do me a favor? 
 Watch the service? 
 I've gotta see Dr. Kotlowitz. 
 - Really? 
 - Yeah, I ran into him. 
 Actually, I went looking for him. 
 Peter, that's terrific. Yes, go! 
 - I can cover service. 
 - Thanks. 
 I need orders on a new admission. 
 I'm not in the mood for jokes. 
 - No, Mr. Ramos is back. 
 - Ramos? Fem-pop bypass? 
 I discharged him yesterday. 
 He's back with an infection 
 and an asthma attack. 
 - You know the rules. 
 - Yep, I know. He's mine. 
 He's on continuous albuterol. 
 Hello, Mr. Ramos. 
 Let's take a look at your legs. 
 I was hoping you'd be here today. 
 Oh, where else would I possibly go? 
 I asked the mom if she'd given 
 the baby food. 
 Guess I talked to the wrong person. 
 The baby's lucky. 
 We can treat botulism. 
 - But what do we do to help Sky? 
 - She's fine. 
 Her mom's draining her childhood. 
 As much neglect and abuse as I see, 
 trust me, Sky is okay. 
 - She needs to be a little girl. 
 - Yeah, that's true. 
 Hey, guys. Okay, now... 
 ...you can't give honey 
 to your brother... 
 ...or to any baby 
 because it can hurt them. 
 Honey can have botulism spores. 
 Their intestines are immature, 
 and they can't k*ll off the spores. 
 He's maxed out with a pressure of   . 
 Systemic resistance is     . 
 Let's start Levophed. 
 Dr. Corday, I need you here. 
 Mr. Ramos is pretty tight. 
 You okay? 
 Yep, I'm fine. 
 - How much albuterol? 
 - Twenty an hour. 
 - He's had Solu-Medrol. 
 -     in the ER. 
 - Okay, I'll push some magnesium. 
 - Magnesium? 
 It relaxes the smooth muscles 
 of the bronchioles. 
 Can you look at Mr. Frybush? 
 Give me five minutes, okay? 
 Carter, can you explain 
 this evaluation? 
 If it's this bad, 
 you should've come to me. 
 Do you have something against her? 
 - Wait a sec... 
 - I want to see you and Lucy. 
 We're gonna figure this out. 
 Find her and then me. 
 - Can I hang on to that? 
 - No! 
 Sound like you're in a good mood. 
 Do me a favor? 
 I need a place to crash. 
 Building's being fumigated. 
 Would Carol mind? 
 - You kidding? Come over. 
 - Save me a few bucks. 
 - Sure thing, glad to have you. 
 - Thanks. 
 He's set up for another 
 four hours of continuous. 
 Magnesium's on board. 
 - How are you feeling, Mr. Ramos? 
 - Dizzy. 
 - Whoa. What's happening? 
 - Maybe he's hypoxic. 
 - How much mag did you give him? 
 - Two grams IV push,    cc's. 
 Forty cc's of    percent mag? 
 Not    percent! Five percent! 
 No, Dr. Corday, 
 you gave him    percent. 
 My God, you're right. 
 I gave him a lethal dose. 
 - He's not breathing. 
 - ET tube! 
 Bradying down. Heart rate's   . 
 Two grams calcium gluconate. 
 Push an amp of atropine. 
 Bag him, prep for IJ. 
 I'll float a pacemaker. 
 - Lost the pulse, in P.E.A. 
 - I'll start compressions. 
 Seven and a half gloves and 
 French Cordis introducer. 
 The cochlear implant is a miracle, 
 and the technology keeps improving. 
 I'm impressed by what I read. 
 Don't read. 
 Talk to people who have it. 
 Talk to parents of kids... 
 I can get you in touch with people 
 who faced the same. 
 Great, I've already heard 
 an earful from the opponents, so... 
 The fanatics. 
 Well, they've got their agendas. 
 The level of passion with which 
 these people attack you, it's bizarre. 
 Someone used the word ""genocidal."" 
 Said I was eradicating deaf culture. 
 Deafness is not 
 an alternative lifestyle. 
 People who claim it is 
 are beyond reasoning with. 
 The thing I figure is... 
 ...why make an argument against 
 hearing and speaking? 
 Honestly, know what I think? 
 I think it comes down to laziness. 
 A deaf person can function. 
 But some people don't want 
 to exercise... 
 ...and do all the drills it takes. 
 Look, it's years of hard work. 
 Yeah, but they have the energy 
 to attack me. 
 The hell with them. 
 Don't stand in my way... 
 ...when I'm trying to help a person 
 function. 
 Why don't you tell me 
 how you really feel? 
 Anyway, you bring in your son 
 and we'll see if he's a candidate. 
 Do you work closely with Dr. Corday? 
 Actually, she's my intern. 
 She told me about the fallout 
 with Rocket Romano. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Do you know if she's seeing anybody? 
 I'm just wondering. 
 I'm pretty sure 
 she's involved with somebody. 
 - I'm not surprised. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Oh, well. 
 - Thanks. 
 You bet, anytime. Give me a call. 
 Check, please. 
 Systolic,    palp. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 We've got capture. 
 Turning the rate down to   . 
 - Did you page Dr. Benton? 
 - Done. 
 - Pulse is stronger. 
 - Good. 
 Pupils are fixed and dilated. 
 That could be the atropine. 
 That, or he stroked out. 
 What happened? 
 I gave him enough magnesium 
 to cause a cardiac arrest. 
 - Twenty grams. 
 - Oh, no. 
 I looked at the label. 
 I thought it said   percent... 
 ...but it was    percent. 
 But I looked at the label. 
 - I got your blood work back. 
 - Thanks, Lynette. 
 Progesterone level's normal. 
 That's good news, you ovulated. 
 I've been trying to get pregnant, 
 and I haven't. 
 - How long have you been at it? 
 - Couple months. 
 Give yourself at least six months... 
 ...before you start worrying. 
 Yeah, you're right. I'm crazy. 
 Maybe you guys need to increase 
 your activity. 
 How often do you, you know, do the do? 
 - What? 
 - Oh, sorry, am I being indiscreet? 
 Carol, what's the deal? 
 I went to see your ectopic. 
 She's dressed, ready to leave. 
 - Maria Jones? 
 - She pulled her IV? 
 Maria, where are you going? 
 I feel better. I'm going home. 
 You were in so much pain, 
 I couldn't examine you. 
 - But I'm better now. 
 - But, wait. 
 We need to make sure 
 everything's okay with you. 
 Just let the doctor look you over. 
 Look, I just wanted to know 
 if it was a boy or a girl. 
 Nothing's wrong, so why worry? 
 Wait! You were faking those 
 abdominal pains? 
 - Are you crazy? 
 - You weren't sure you were pregnant. 
 Why would you lie and cause 
 all that drama... 
 ...to find out if it's a boy or a...? 
 - No, are you gonna abort this baby? 
 - Let go of me! 
 - Carol! 
 - She's had two boys and two abortions. 
 Are you getting rid of this child...? 
 It's my baby and I'll do what I want. 
 I told you that ultrasound 
 is inconclusive. It could be a boy! 
 Lady, take your hands off of me. 
 Carol, let her go. 
 Girls are trouble anyhow. 
 What's the matter with you? 
 What's the matter with you?! 
 How could you inject a patient 
 with    grams of magnesium? 
 I make no excuses. 
 It was a grievous error. 
 Where were you during this, 
 Dr. Benton? 
 I was out of the hospital. 
 I came when I was paged. 
 It wouldn't have mattered, anyway. 
 You left your intern unsupervised. 
 This patient may have suffered 
 brain injury. 
 I stopped by the unit. 
 Mr. Ramos' eyes are open, 
 and he's responding. 
 You are not to leave while on duty. 
 You are not to leave 
 your intern unsupervised. 
 I know it's hard for us all to view 
 Elizabeth as an intern. 
 But we've opened up this hospital 
 to enormous liability. 
 I'll speak to Risk Management 
 and the hospital attorneys. 
 They'll determine what information 
 to release to the families. 
 Don't either of you discuss 
 this with anyone. 
 Can we get together 
 and not talk about this? 
 I have to pick up my son 
 from my sister's house. 
 All right. 
 You just need to get 
 a good night's sleep. 
 I didn't fill this out. 
 - Who did? 
 - She did. 
 - Why did she? 
 - Because he told me to. 
 I didn't say to give it to him, 
 I said to give it to me. 
 - No, you didn't. 
 - Okay, wait. 
 Don't talk to each other, talk to me. 
 Mark, I wanted to know 
 how she thought she was doing... 
 ...before my final assessment. 
 I tried to put myself 
 in his shoes... 
 ...and be critical. 
 He said, ""fill it out""... 
 ...meaning ""turn it in."" 
 - How could she assume that? 
 Makes no sense. 
 That's part of his problem. 
 Incomplete directions. 
 I give incomplete directions? 
 - Name a time. 
 - Just one? 
 Tell her to name a time 
 when I gave her... 
 ...incomplete directions. 
 - Okay, talk to each other. 
 Don't talk to me. 
 Whatever this is, I can't fix it. 
 Work it out, both of you. 
 Kerry, I need to talk to you 
 about the x-ray report. 
 Please don't blow me off. 
 Sorry, trauma coming in. 
 Possible candidate 
 for the thoracotomy study. 
 I didn't know that's running. 
 s*ab wound to left chest. 
 Had a pulse in the field. 
 Gave him epi,      cc's of saline. 
 Shocked him twice. 
 Great candidate. The stopwatch? 
 Right here. 
 You mind if I tag along? 
 Now, start the timer. Here we go. 
 On my count: One, two, three! 
 Two units of O-neg on the infuser. 
 Get type-specific as soon as you can. 
 Ten blade, let's go. 
 Good breath sounds bilaterally. 
 Seven and a half gloves. 
 Okay, skin incision is complete. 
 Mark the time. Saw, please. 
 - Sternal retractor. 
 - Good job! 
 - I need a purple top. 
 - Pulse ox   . 
 - Mark the time. 
 - Suction, please. 
 Pickups and Metz. 
 Looks like blood in the pericardium. 
 First hemoglobin is  . . 
 Okay, pericardium is open. 
 Mark the time. 
 I see a s*ab wound 
 to the left ventricle. 
 - What are we at? 
 - Forty-two seconds. 
 Take over internal compressions. 
 Tamponade the wound.  -O silk. 
 One horizontal mattress should do it. 
 - Two units are in. 
 - Hang another two. How's the heart? 
 - Starting to fill. 
 - Get the paddles ready. 
 Okay, cardiac injury is repaired. 
 Mark the time. 
 - V-fib. 
 - Charging to    and clear. 
 - Sinus rhythm. 
 - Cardiac activity restored, mark time. 
 - I've got a pulse. 
 - Excellent job, Kerry. 
 Dr. Greene. 
 Dr. Lee. Finding your way around? 
 Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask you. 
 I didn't feel I connected with you 
 at my interview. 
 - Is that a correct assessment? 
 - How do you mean? 
 I'd look over and wonder, 
 ""Am I making my best case?"" 
 It was a good interview... 
 I like this department 
 and I want this job. 
 I'm one of the baddest ER b*tches 
 out there. 
 If I didn't make my best case before, 
 I'd like to try again now. 
 Can I grab a soda and sit with you? 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Call me when he's in Recovery. 
 - Don, I have something to confess. 
 - Oh? 
 For a while I felt resentment 
 when it became clear... 
 ...I wasn't your choice to run 
 the Emergency Department full-time. 
 - It's not that you weren't qualified... 
 - Hold on. 
 Now I am so grateful to be putting 
 all of myself into medicine. 
 And I want you to know there are 
 no lingering hard feelings on my part. 
 Well, I must say I could sense 
 the bad feelings. 
 I did wish there was something I could 
 do because I value your friendship. 
 Well, how's the job search going? 
 We interviewed a wonderful woman. 
 Amanda Lee, out of Atlanta. 
 - I don't know her. 
 - Join us for dinner? 
 I'd love to hear what you think. 
 Don, I'm trying. 
 But I'm not all the way there yet. 
 Thanks. 
 Isn't it weird living with your boss? 
 No, we get along okay. 
 Plus, it's a bargain. 
 All I have to do is some yard work, 
 clean the gutters. 
 Do the stuff that she can't handle. 
 Roxanne, if you make me forget 
 this day... 
 ...I will owe you the biggest favor. 
 - Lousy day, huh? 
 - My med student is driving me crazy. 
 - Lucy. 
 There's so much I want to teach her. 
 And it's just not happening. 
 I don't think I'm a bad teacher. 
 I don't think she's a bad student. 
 You know what? 
 I can say one good thing about Lucy. 
 She's not here. 
 Oh, you make a good point. 
 - Didn't mean to put you to work. 
 - Don't be silly. It's gonna be nice. 
 - Want some more? 
 - No, no. 
 It was good, though. 
 Hey, who's making all that noise? 
 What's up, man? 
 Come on. 
 Let's get ready to go, huh? 
 Come on, say goodbye to Aunt Jackie. 
 Jackie, who gave him this phone? 
 Oh, it's a toy, Peter. 
 It's a cute shape, and he likes it. 
 He probably saw you on it all day. 
 Hey, hey! 
 I'm sorry. You know, 
 we went to a surgeon today. 
 I'm trying to do what's best, and 
 I feel like I'm in a b*ttlefield. 
 The more information I get, 
 the less I know. 
 I don't have anybody to talk with. 
 What about Carla? 
 Yeah, she's looking for me 
 to take the lead on this thing. 
 I can't go back and forth 
 over it with her. 
 Your girlfriend's a doctor. 
 Why can't you talk with Elizabeth? 
 - Hey, hey. 
 - Peter? 
 - Hey, come on. 
 - Peter? 
 Come on. Hey, man.","[""you lie and cause \n all that drama... \n ...to find out if it's a boy or a...? \n - No, are you gonna abort this baby? \n - Let go of me! \n - Carol! \n - She's had two boys and two abortions. \n Are you getting""]",True

 We'd be better off as friends. 
 Mark, thanks again for dinner. 
 God forbid you listen to me and learn! 
 Yes, I was engaged once. 
 To a really lovely man. 
 And he was k*lled in a freak 
 horseback riding accident. 
 You bring a child into this world, 
 and you think they're helpless. 
 But, actually, I think it's us. 
 We're the ones that are helpless. 
 - What time's that big do at your mom's? 
 - Right after church. 
 I promised her we'd be there for 
 Christmas caroling with Uncle Ted. 
 That the old guy with the banjo? 
 It's a family tradition, kind of 
 like going to Mass on Christmas Eve. 
 If I go, I'll feel like a hypocrite. 
 - Kneeling and standing and... 
 - You could just sit. 
 Everybody gives me dirty looks. 
 Like I'm a pagan. 
 You are a pagan. 
 Oh, what a glorious day! 
 Did you see the sky? 
 - It's like a painting. 
 - Makes you glad to be alive. 
 - Unless you're being persecuted. 
 - What? 
 - He doesn't like Dr. Lee's new system. 
 - What new system? 
 Patients get two charts: 
 For docs and for nurses. 
 We get to do our notes 
 at the same time. 
 Orders get in quicker, 
 patients get meds faster. 
 Docs don't waste time chasing charts. 
 So, what's the problem? 
 ""Someone"" has to keep track 
 of twice as many charts as normal... 
 ...doubling his workload. 
 Not that anyone cares. 
 Good morning, g*ng. 
 Oh, my God, Amanda! 
 What have you done? 
 Christmas nibblies: Dried fruit, 
 mixed nuts, little chocolate reindeer. 
 Don't mind if I do. 
 Wait. First dibs should go to Jerry. 
 It's only fair since he's bearing 
 the brunt of the new charting system. 
 No, thank you. I'm not hungry. 
 As you wish. Seriously, if you find 
 yourself in the weeds, call me. 
 - I'll make sure you get support. 
 - Sure. 
 Excuse me. 
 That's a Christmas card image, 
 the sight of you wrapping a book. 
 Something educational 
 for one of your nieces? 
 No. Actually, it's for you. 
 It's T.S. Eliot. 
 I know you said you liked him, 
 so I got it last month... 
 ...when we were still, you know... 
 Peter, that's so sweet. 
 I can't think of 
 a more thoughtful gift. 
 Thank you. 
 Oh, please, forget it. 
 Listen, I was wondering... 
 ...if we could finish 
 our workups around noon. 
 I need to get out of here 
 early tonight. 
 Oh, you've got big 
 Christmas Eve plans. 
 Yeah. My sister's hosting a dinner. 
 Carla's gonna bring Reece by. 
 - I haven't seen him all week. 
 - I understand. 
 I absolutely hate being away 
 from my family during the holidays. 
 In fact, I'm so desperate not to be 
 alone this Christmas Eve... 
 ...that I bought a ticket 
 to the Surgeons' Society Gala. 
 Oh, golly. 
 Yep. And you won't believe 
 who's sitting next to me. 
 Hey, there she is! 
 So I checked around. 
 We definitely have the coolest table. 
 It's lucky we're both able to make it. 
 A little trouble in paradise? 
 Anyway, so tonight's dinner 
 is semiformal... 
 ...so any slinky black number will do. 
 If I may voice my preference... 
 ...something short 
 and off-the-shoulder would be ideal. 
 Peter, by the way, that reminds me. 
 I have a lot of charts 
 and I want to get out of here early. 
 - I need you to cover my rounds. 
 - That'll mess up my morning. 
 Look at it this way. I get a life... 
 ...and you earn a special place 
 in my heart. 
 Do you know a garage that's open? 
 My crappy car died on the Dan Ryan. 
 On Christmas Eve? Good luck. 
 - Lydia, is that...? 
 - Card from Jen. 
 - My ex-wife sent you a Christmas card? 
 - No. She sent one to me. 
 We've exchanged cards for years. 
 Christmas, birthdays... 
 - I was reading the newsletter. 
 - ""Merry Christmas from the Simons."" 
 - What? 
 - Their new house sounds amazing. 
 - I know.      square feet? 
 - Six bedrooms, three baths? 
 That sounds just like Jen 
 to be bragging about her house. 
 - I wouldn't call it bragging. 
 - She's sharing good news. 
 - Yeah, Jen made partner. 
 - Jen made partner? 
 - The firm even got her a new Beemer.

 - Pacer pads? 
 - Third drawer on the left. 
 ""May God bless you and keep you. 
 Merry Christmas. Emily Ropella."" 
 - Do you remember her? 
 - Not a clue. 
 It's a nice card, though. 
 Does it bother you 
 that God gets the credit? 
 One can be called worse things 
 than ""an instrument of God."" 
 So you believe in...? 
 I give Him the benefit of the doubt. 
 - You? 
 - I don't know. 
 Sometimes I think that God 
 is just this comforting illusion. 
 We want everything to have meaning, 
 so we create this puppet master... 
 ...when everything is just arbitrary: 
 Life, death, natural disasters... 
 The Master is displeased. 
 I'm so sorry. I can't believe 
 he foisted this on you. 
 No use worrying about it now. 
 I'll start the preops. 
 That'll save time. 
 Whatever. 
 Hello, Mr. Gardner. 
 I have the results of your MRI. 
 Good. So, how's it look? 
 Good news. It appears the cancer 
 hasn't spread beyond the capsule. 
 Great. So does this mean 
 I can hold on to my prostate? 
 I'm afraid not. 
 Dr. Romano does want to continue... 
 ...with the radical prostatectomy 
 tomorrow morning as scheduled. 
 But with the surgery, you stand an 
 excellent chance of beating the cancer. 
 It really is very good news. 
 - Is Dr. Romano around? 
 - He's in surgery. 
 Is it something I can help you with? 
 He had mentioned the operation could 
 result in my losing sexual function. 
 I take it that's still the case? 
 We'll do our best to do 
 a nerve-sparing procedure. 
 - But there is that possibility, yes. 
 - How strong a possibility? 
 Well, according to Dr. Romano's notes, 
 as high as    to    percent. 
 Eighty percent. 
 Has Dr. Romano discussed 
 your options... 
 ...about having children 
 in the future? 
 No. 
 Well, you might want to consider... 
 ...paying a visit to a sperm bank. 
 That way, if there's 
 a loss of function... 
 ...you can still have children 
 through alternative means. 
 Right. 
 Dr. Lee? 
 You startled me. 
 Sorry. Dr. Anspaugh would 
 like you to call him. 
 What's wrong with Dr. Greene's locker? 
 I found it ajar. I shut it 
 before something walked away. 
 - Thanks for the message. 
 - Sure. 
 I've got supraventricular tachycardia. 
 It happens all the time. 
 Rate's    . BP's     palp. 
 Just cardiovert me at 
 and I'm on my way. 
 Let's put him on a monitor 
 and get a strip. 
 I'm trying to tell you, 
 I've got SVTs. 
 Just cardiovert me at   . 
 It works every time. 
 I appreciate the tip. 
 But I need to examine you myself. 
 - I'm trying to save some time here. 
 - Stop talking. 
 Would you tell him that I have SVTs? 
 I've got SVTs! 
 - Let go. 
 - I've got SVTs! 
 I heard you! 
 I need to examine you myself. 
 - I'm gonna be late for work! 
 - Let go! 
 Are you one of Santa's helpers? 
 The helpers just pass out the goody 
 bags. I'm an elf. A singing elf. 
 - Oh, part of a choir? 
 - There's four of us. 
 But thanks to ""Super Doc,"" the 
 Elf Tones are gonna be a tenor short. 
 - Here you go. 
 - It says I have SVTs, right? 
 I knew it! You want to shock me 
 at    now, smart-ass? 
 I got an   -year-old, flatline! 
 - How long down? 
 - Unknown. Mother found him. 
 Gave him two rounds of epi, 
 two of atropine. 
 - Got any signs of life? 
 - Got him back once. 
 Get him on a monitor. 
 Carter, check ventilation. 
 - What can I do? 
 - Rectal temp. 
 - Great. 
 - All right. 
 On my count. Watch your hand there. 
 One, two, three, go. 
 Any signs of dr*gs, su1c1de? 
 Said he had a k*ller headache. 
 Took a nap and never woke up. 
 - A subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 - k*ller headache is right. 
 - Monitor's up. 
 - No femoral pulse. 
 - Asystole. 
 - No spontaneous respirations. 
 - No response to pain. 
 - Anybody got any good news? 
 Pupils are... 
 ...fixed and dilated. 
 No corneal reflex. 
 He's only   . 
 Zadro got him back once, maybe we 
 can do it again. High dose of epi. 
 Put him on a pulse ox. 
 An end-tidal CO-  detector. 
 - Paddles, please. 
 - Crank it to   . Let's go! 
 - Let's start at   . 
 - Twenty? Why? 
 Because I said so, that's why. 
 Oh, that's mature. 
 - Charged to   . 
 - Clear. 
 - How did we do? 
 - No change. 
 Fifty? Do I hear   ? 
 - Let's go to   . 
 - Oh, for crying out loud! 
 Why not just go to   ? 
 Because he has a sensitive rhythm. 
 I don't want to overshock him. 
 - Charge to   . 
 - Clear. 
 Anything? 
 - Nothing. 
 - I don't want to question your genius. 
 But can we go to    while I still 
 got some hair on my chest? 
 - Let's go to   . 
 - It's about time! 
 - Charged. 
 - Clear. 
 That did it. 
 Back to normal sinus. 
 Watch him for 
 and then let him go. 
 Thanks for nothing, Dr. Mengele! 
 Time? 
 Twelve minutes. 
 - Check his rhythm. 
 - Still no pulse. 
 - Asystole. 
 - Keep at it. 
 Ten of epi onboard. 
 The boy's mother is in Chairs. 
 - She wants to talk to someone. 
 - Carter, you want to do that? 
 Don't get her hopes up. 
 All right. 
 Give me another epi,   milligrams. 
 - Mrs. Richards? 
 - My son? 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Carter. 
 Your son's heart stopped beating. 
 We're doing everything 
 to start it again. 
 We're giving him medicine 
 and doing CPR. 
 Why would his heart stop? 
 He's    years old. 
 There's a sign that he had 
 a brain hemorrhage... 
 ...which could've 
 caused the cardiac arrest. 
 How? He's the picture of health. 
 It could be a weak artery, possibly 
 something that's existed since birth. 
 The thing is, 
 he's been down a long time. 
 The longer he goes without oxygen, 
 the less likely we can bring him back. 
 - We might need to have a conversation... 
 - Please don't give up on him. 
 He's all that I have. 
 Please. 
 Okay. 
 I'll be back. 
 Hold it. Hold the compressions. 
 Any sign of a rhythm? 
 - Flatline. 
 - Let's call it. 
 Not yet. Keep bagging. 
 You got a reason to keep flogging him? 
 He's   , his mother's only child. 
 And it's Christmas. 
 Want a miracle? 
 He's been down for   . 
 - So, what's five more? 
 - Okay, doctor. Let's go. 
 Resuming compressions. Keep bagging. 
 And another round of high-dose epi. 
 Start a dopamine drip. 
 Get those paddles ready. 
 - He's in asystole. 
 - He may be in fine V-fib. 
 Charge to    . No,    . 
 - Charging. 
 - Let's hold a really positive thought. 
 - Ready. 
 - Clear! 
 - Was that a beat? 
 - My God! 
 - Two beats does not a rhythm make. 
 - Slap some pads on him. 
 All right. Here you go. 
 Can you roll him? 
 - Set it at   . 
 - You're on. 
 - It's not capturing. 
 - Dial up the gain. 
 Come on. 
 Just gotta get it to capture. 
 - He's throwing PVCs. 
 - Hold that lidocaine. 
 Maximum gain. 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 - We got it! 
 - He's got a rhythm! 
 - Take a carotid. 
 - Pulse? 
 - Strong at    . 
 - BP is    . 
 Send him to CT, 
 find out where he's bleeding. 
 - How'd you...? 
 - I'm an instrument! 
 - Way to go! 
 - Hope he's got some brain left. 
 You want contrast? 
 No, but call Respiratory. 
 Make sure they got a vent and scanner. 
 Looks like we got our miracle. 
 If he wakes up. Even if he does, 
 he'll probably have brain damage. 
 Carter. 
 Better prepare the mother. 
 Yes, Ma. 
 Of course we're coming. 
 Uncle Ted wants Doug to play 
 ""Silent Night"" on the tambourine? 
 I think he'd love it. 
 Yeah. Hey, do you have 
 any videotape left in the videocam? 
 Yep. Yes, I am coming to Mass. 
 No, he is not. But, you know what? 
 We should probably respect his choice. 
 It would be nice 
 if we all went together. 
 If I'm needed, 
 I'll be out at the roach coach. 
 I'll be here suffocating 
 under a mountain of charts. 
 That's odd. I swear I had 
 my gloves in my pocket. 
 Dr. Lee took them. 
 What did you say? 
 I saw her at your locker earlier. 
 - That is ridiculous, Jerry. 
 - What's ridiculous? 
 He's accusing Amanda 
 of stealing my gloves. 
 I tell you she had your locker open, 
 and she was very suspicious. 
 I know you're angry at Amanda 
 for the new chart system... 
 ...but to accuse her of 
 being a thief... 
 You didn't see how weird 
 she was acting. 
 Can it, Jerry. 
 I finished the work on Landis. 
 How are you? 
 - Two more preops, then postops. 
 - You may make your dinner after all. 
 What'll it be? Goose in 
 chestnut sauce or roast venison? 
 We gotta call in our entr¬†√Åes. 
 Dr. Romano, Mr. DeMisa is coming back 
 in with postoperative pain. 
 What a pain in the ass! 
 You assisted on his gastroplasty, 
 didn't you? 
 - What? Yeah. 
 - Great! When he comes in, take him. 
 I'm already busy. 
 I'm trying to get home for dinner. 
 Sometimes being a Resident just sucks. 
 So, what'll it be? 
 Mother Goose or Bambi? 
 Are these leads on? 
 The leads are on. 
 Nothing in the alpha, theta or 
 delta frequencies. He's brain-dead. 
 Well, maybe he can be an organ donor. 
 Not too likely. He has type AB blood. 
 That's, what,  % of the population? 
 I doubt you'll find 
 many compatible candidates. 
 - It's worth a try. 
 - Sure it is. Talk to the mother. 
 If she won't go for it, 
 try to persuade her to pull the plug. 
 So much for my miracle. 
 Dr. Corday, the fertility 
 clinic just called. 
 Your patient, David Gardner, 
 is having an MI. 
 His EKG was normal this morning. 
 Is he upstairs? 
 They're taking him to the ER. 
 Okay. 
 I just took an unusual complaint. 
 An irate elf claims you tortured him 
 with the cardioversion paddles? 
 We differed over treatment strategies. 
 I wouldn't quite call it t*rture. 
 I know. I read the chart. 
 He's clearly a nut case. 
 - I'm just making sure you're all right. 
 - I'm okay. 
 Although, to be honest, 
 I could've handled it better. 
 I'm a little off my game today. 
 Blame it on the holidays. 
 - Is it a rough time of year for you? 
 - Not usually. 
 My ex-wife, she sent out this 
 newsletter saying how happy she is. 
 I can't help but see it as her saying, 
 ""Look how well I traded up."" 
 - I got it. 
 - Thanks. 
 - It's a tough time of year for me too. 
 - Really? 
 This is the first Christmas 
 since my brother committed su1c1de. 
 Oh, jeez! I'm sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 It was one of those apocalyptic cult 
 things. The guys with the sneakers? 
 Oh, yeah. I thought that 
 was a couple of years ago. 
 He missed the big event, 
 so he decided to follow on his own. 
 Wow! Sorry. I gotta say you're 
 handling it better than I would've. 
 I credit that to my Grandma Lee. 
 She always said: 
 ""Whatever life throws at you, 
 greet it with a smile. 
 There's nothing as contagious 
 as a positive attitude."" 
 I think we'd all be better off 
 if we followed Grandma's advice. 
 Here we go. 
 Coming through. 
 - Let's get him into Trauma  . 
 - Mr. Gardner, how are you? 
 My chest feels tight. 
 I can't breathe. 
 Is he your patient? 
 Yes, and he's hyperventilating 
 like crazy. 
 Hook him up to a   -lead EKG 
 and a pulse ox. Start a line. 
 Get a mask on him. 
 We need to get your breathing under 
 control. Concentrate on the breaths. 
 Let the breath out slowly. 
 Slowly. 
 - Monitor's up. 
 - All right. 
 Yep, pulse is up to   . 
 That's a good sign. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Breathe in on the count of five. 
 One. 
 Two. 
 Oh, my! You're David... 
 You're David Gardner, right? 
 The trumpet soloist? 
 I saw your guest performance 
 with the Chicago Symphony. 
 I'm sorry. I'm Kerry Weaver, 
 season ticket holder. 
 Breathe out. 
 I just loved your featured 
 performance in Mahler  . 
 It gave me shivers. 
 Slowly. 
 - Where do you go next? 
 - Boston. 
 - Breathe in. 
 - The BSO! Yes! 
 - I got your   -lead. 
 - Breathe out. 
 David, your heart looks just fine. 
 We'll run a few tests 
 just to make sure. 
 But I think that you were 
 just having an anxiety attack. 
 Are you a bit nervous 
 about playing for Ozawa? 
 Breathe in. 
 How long have you had the pain? 
 Ever since the surgery. 
 I wish I'd never had it. 
 I heard stapling my stomach would help 
 me reduce, but I haven't lost a pound. 
 Have you been sticking 
 to the all-liquid diet? 
 - What did you have today? 
 - A little blended tea. 
 What was in it? 
 Bacon and eggs. 
 Mr. DeMisa! 
 But I blended it up. 
 - What else did you have? 
 - A smoothie. 
 And what was in that? 
 Low-fat milk... 
 ...some butternut squash... 
 ...sweet potato pancakes, 
 a honey-glazed ham... 
 ...and a caramel-orange Buche de Noel. 
 - That's a full Christmas dinner. 
 - Oh, also, I'm a little backed up. 
 - What do you mean a little backed up? 
 - Constipated. 
 Okay. He probably busted a staple. 
 Set him up for a gastrograph 
 and give him a laxative. 
 I like the chocolate ones. 
 If that's all right? 
 Dr. Carter... 
 ...I was talking to Steven 
 and he moved his arm. 
 He's having involuntary muscle spasms. 
 I think he was trying 
 to tell me something. 
 I'm afraid that's not possible. 
 We did a test on Steven to check for 
 brain activity. We didn't find any. 
 Well, then... 
 ...it'll take some time and... 
 Time isn't going to help. 
 Steven is brain-dead. 
 No possibility of recovery. 
 I know this is a really difficult 
 thing to think about right now. 
 One way to salvage something 
 positive out of this... 
 ...is to donate Steven's organs. 
 No, I... 
 I can't let you take out his organs 
 when his heart is still beating. 
 If that's the case, I'd ask you... 
 ...to consider signing 
 a ""do not resuscitate"" order. 
 That way, if Steven's heart 
 fails again... 
 ...we won't subject him 
 to overly aggressive procedures... 
 ...by prolonging his life 
 in a vegetative state. 
 I can hope for a miracle, can't I? 
 Well, who do we have here? 
 Mrs. Hutton fainted 
 while shopping at Lakewood Mall. 
 I'm sorry. Don't worry, we'll have 
 you back on your feet in a jiff. 
 All right. 
 You been hitting the nitrous? 
 You gotta greet life with a smile. 
 I do? 
 Yeah. A positive attitude 
 is contagious. 
 So why don't you 
 tell me what happened? 
 I went to Field's 
 Night Before Christmas sale. 
 It was crowded. It was hot. 
 It was stuffy. I passed out. 
 - Very nicely put. 
 - Thanks. 
 Why don't we order Mrs. Hutton some 
 cardiac enzymes, CBC and a Chem- ? 
 Hold it! 
 How much do those things cost? 
 Gosh! I don't know. 
 - You won't tell me? 
 - No, I mean I really don't know. 
 - Please sit up. 
 - Oh, I got your number now. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - You think you're pretty smart, huh? 
 Sweet-talking me into buying all those 
 expensive tests I don't need. 
 Just trying to make a diagnosis. 
 I'm trying to survive 
 on Social Security. 
 We can't all make a doctor's salary. 
 Your insurance will pay for the tests. 
 Oh, so that's your racket! 
 Ripping off insurance companies. 
 It's crooks like you 
 that keep my premiums so high. 
 Get me another doctor! 
 He's the best doctor we have. 
 Well, I don't like the look of him. 
 The way he smiles and talks. 
 I want another doctor! 
 Any doctor as long as it isn't him! 
 Mr. Gardner, your labs look stunning. 
 We should probably wait on the cardiac 
 enzymes before letting you go. 
 At this rate, I should 
 check in for the night. 
 It would certainly save you 
 the drive in for surgery tomorrow. 
 No, the less time I spend here 
 the better. No offense. 
 None taken. 
 So how are you feeling? 
 Like an idiot. Here I thought 
 I was having this big heart attack... 
 ...turns out I'm just a nervous wreck. 
 If you want, 
 you could postpone surgery. 
 No. I have to be 
 recovered by January   th. 
 I'm doing a televised special 
 with the Boston Symphony. 
 Oh, I'll have to mark my calendar. 
 Symphony fan? 
 I know very little 
 about orchestral music. 
 So, what do you like? 
 Well... 
 ...I'm embarrassed to say. 
 How bad can it be? 
 I'm in a disco phase at the moment. 
 Yes, well, I can see why 
 you would be embarrassed. 
 - You paged me? 
 - We've got a problem. He's stuck. 
 - Stuck? 
 - He's wedged in. I can't get him out. 
 - What do you expect me to do? 
 - Help me get him out? 
 I don't have time for that. 
 Have Maintenance 
 take the chair apart. 
 - What? 
 - I gotta go to the bathroom. 
 - You'll have to hold it. 
 - Help! 
 - Help me get him out, please? 
 - Please! 
 Okay, come on. Grab his arms. 
 Oh, man! 
 All right, on my count. 
 One, two, three. 
 What a waste. 
 Why did I do it? Why did I do it? 
 I know... I know better. 
 You tried to save a life. 
 I let that ""instrument of God"" 
 stuff go to my head. 
 Maybe it is all arbitrary. 
 Why does he deserve 
 a brain hemorrhage? 
 And why does it blow on Christmas Eve? 
 What's the point? 
 I got the tests back 
 on that teenager in  . 
 A little Christmas present 
 from the stork. 
 Well, I'd better 
 go give the good news. 
 - Oh, my God! 
 - Here. 
 Oh, Dr. Weaver, you have to read this. 
 - Read what? 
 - A triple-X sex fantasy. 
 Excuse me? 
 I found it in Dr. Lee's charts. 
 It's her handwriting. 
 ""I took M.G.'s gloved hand and placed 
 it on my heaving pink stippled breast."" 
 Why am I reading this? 
 Don't you get it? 
 ""M.G."" is Mark Greene. 
 Come on! 
 What about the glove reference? 
 You have completely lost your mind. 
 You found my notes on Mrs. Condrell. 
 I've looked up and down. 
 - Mrs. Condrell? 
 - That psych patient? It's a sad case. 
 She's psychotic, 
 extremely hypersexual... 
 ...and has these obsessive fantasies 
 about Merv Griffin, of all people. 
 Anyway, thank you. 
 Next time you want to make an ass 
 out of yourself, leave me out of it. 
 - Could there be a mistake? 
 - No mistake, Laura. You're pregnant. 
 Oh, God! 
 What do I do? 
 - Can you talk to your mother? 
 - No way. She'll k*ll me. 
 Your dad? 
 - No. 
 - Thanks. 
 I had to sneak out even to come here. 
 Are you gonna tell them? 
 Not if you don't want me to. 
 I don't. 
 You have some choices: 
 You can have the baby, keep it... 
 ...have the baby, put it up for adoption, 
 or have an abortion. 
 I can't have a baby. 
 There's no way. 
 Can you help me? 
 Yes, I can. I'll be right back. 
 Stephanie, can you...? Thanks. 
 Hey, Carol. 
 I got a pregnant 
 -year-old in there... 
 ...who wants an abortion 
 on the holidays. 
 God! Thirteen. 
 Well, you think you can arrange that? 
 Merry Christmas. Yeah. 
 You can take it from here? 
 Sure. 
 Carla, I know his bedtime is at  :  . 
 I might not be able 
 to make it until then. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 Listen, listen. Okay, okay. 
 It's Christmas Eve. 
 I just want see my son, okay? 
 Okay. Thank you so much. 
 I promise. I will. Yeah, bye. 
 - How's it going? 
 - Don't ask. 
 - You call the ER for DeMisa? 
 - He's still on the toilet. 
 Lizzie, if you're ready, 
 we can go together. 
 I have a couple of patients 
 to finish with. 
 - Is Peter trying to ruin our evening? 
 - No, not at all. 
 It was a joke. 
 Look, I'll see you there. 
 I left these unfinished 
 dictations for you. 
 They need to be in by  . 
 Appreciate the help. See you later. 
 -year-old, unconscious, 
 history of biliary atresia. 
 - Hepatic coma? 
 - Looks like it. 
 - She was fine until six months ago. 
 - What medication is she on? 
 Ampicillin, tobramycin, 
 vitamins A, D and K. 
 The skin's jaundiced. 
 Same with sclera. 
 Her breath smells sweet. 
 - Fetor hepaticus? 
 - Yep. 
 - What's that? 
 - Liver's shut down. Dip a urine. 
 It's getting crowded in here. 
 Can you deal with the parents? 
 Start lactulose,    cc's per NG. 
 We're giving her medicine 
 to clean her blood. 
 - Blood in the urine. 
 - She's bleeding inside? 
 The liver failure's 
 causing her blood not to clot. 
 Oh, God! 
 Is she on the transplant list? 
 She's been Status  A for six months. 
 But they haven't found a match. 
 - Why not? What's her blood type? 
 - AB. 
 What are you doing? 
 Are you hiding back here? 
 Exactly. 
 I tried your grandma's ""greet with 
 a smile"" approach on a patient... 
 ...and she threw me out. 
 - No! 
 Yep. 
 I've restricted myself to the 
 unconscious for the rest of the day. 
 Now, now. 
 There's something about me that 
 brings out the worst in people. 
 I've noticed that. 
 I'm like a magnet for negativity. 
 People get too close... 
 ...I'll pull the positive 
 right out of them. 
 - Oh, my God! 
 - What? 
 - I suddenly feel sad. 
 - Low blood sugar? 
 No. It's definitely you. 
 Hey, shut the hell up. 
 I'm trying to sleep here. 
 Another satisfied customer. 
 Two kids come in. One's brain-dead, 
 the other needs a liver. 
 They're both AB. A godsend! 
 - The mother won't consent. 
 - She will when I get through with her. 
 - Where's his mother? 
 - Not here. 
 - Is he throwing PVCs? 
 - Yeah. 
 Why didn't you call me? 
 Get the pacer... 
 - Can't. DNR. 
 - What? 
 - She said you talked her into it. 
 - There goes your godsend. 
 - She say where she's going? 
 - No. 
 If she comes back, keep her here. 
 Laura, Dr. Sarafini can take you. 
 What's wrong? 
 I just keep thinking. 
 It's a mortal sin. 
 Do you believe that? 
 It doesn't matter what I believe. 
 What do you think? 
 I don't know. 
 Anyone in your family you can talk to? 
 A sister maybe? 
 What about your mom? 
 She'll k*ll me. 
 Look, Laura, this isn't gonna be easy. 
 But it's a very big decision. 
 I don't think you know what to do. 
 You really need to talk to someone. 
 Can you call my mom? 
 Yeah. I can. I'll call her. 
 I'll call her. 
 - She's not back yet? 
 - No. He just went into V-tach. 
 Damn it! 
 I got a faint pulse. 
 Give him    of lidocaine. Get the 
 paddles, I'll take responsibility. 
 Yeah, and I'll lose my license. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - I'll code him myself. 
 - You're crazy. 
 - You can't ignore her wishes. 
 You wanted a miracle? 
 These two kids arriving on 
 the same day is as close as it gets. 
 She may not see it the way you do. 
 I'll bet she does. 
 - You're only thinking of yourself. 
 - And a dying   -year-old girl. 
 Charging at    . 
 Move them. Move them! 
 - Clear! 
 - You're both crazy. 
 - Back in sinus. 
 - Oh, now you did it! 
 Page me if he goes south. 
 I'm going to find his mother. 
 So which section of the orchestra 
 are you going out with now? 
 I've been unattached since 
 I started the tour. Six months now. 
 - That's a long time to be on the road. 
 - Yeah. Sure is. 
 Swarms of groupies in every city? 
 Well, a classical soloist 
 doesn't quite... 
 ...lead the life of a Rolling Stone. 
 But if I'd known I was gonna 
 lose my prostate... 
 ...I would have made more 
 of an effort. Believe me. 
 Are you still anxious 
 about the surgery tomorrow? 
 I was never all that anxious about the 
 surgery, per se. It was more the... 
 What? 
 - You really want to know? 
 - Yes. 
 Well, I went up to your clinic 
 to deposit my... 
 ...DNA. 
 Of course, they directed me to 
 the cubicle where they'd set up... 
 ...the specimen jar and the... 
 ...men's magazine. 
 And l... 
 And I just kept thinking: 
 ""Well, this is it. 
 This is my last sexual experience."" 
 And l... Well, you know the rest. 
 First time in history somebody's had 
 performance anxiety while by himself. 
 David, would you like to grab 
 a bite to eat somewhere? 
 Yes, Elizabeth. 
 I would like that very much. 
 Mr. DeMisa, we got your x-rays back. 
 They're clear, so you are... 
 Mr. DeMisa? 
 Mr. DeMisa? 
 Takata, have you seen 
 our    -pound patient? 
 - What? 
 - I'm missing five patient dinners. 
 Damn it! 
 - Over here. 
 - What is it? 
 Cake crumbs. 
 Looks like German chocolate. 
 Mr. DeMisa? Damn it! 
 He's unconscious. 
 He vomited. There's at least 
 a half a gallon here. 
 No bowel sounds, abdomen's rigid. 
 He really did it. 
 - He blew a staple? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Need a gurney! 
 - Prep an O.R., get an x-ray. 
 Get Romano's ass back here. 
 Mrs. Richards? 
 I'm sorry to bother you... 
 ...but an extraordinary 
 thing has happened. 
 A   -year-old girl with the exact 
 same rare blood type as Steven's... 
 ...came into the ER in liver failure. 
 Now, I can't help but to think... 
 ...that if God meant 
 for Steven to die tonight... 
 ...at Christmas... 
 ...then it must be 
 so that this girl can live. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But I can't think about 
 another child's problems right now. 
 All I want is for my son 
 to die peacefully... 
 ...and to be buried whole. 
 Excuse me. 
 - Lots of free air under the diaphragm. 
 - Yeah, he's perfed his stomach. 
 - Romano? 
 - I paged him five times. 
 - Who's on call? 
 - Guthrie. Just started a Triple A. 
 BP's dropped to    palp. 
 We can't wait much longer. 
 He's got a fever. 
 Give him a gram of cefotaxime, 
 of Flagyl. 
 Hand me a scalpel. 
 - You're starting without an Attending? 
 - He's septic. 
 We keep him on the table, he'll die. 
 What the hell? Hey, Carol? 
 Hey, you see there's a priest 
 in there with that girl? 
 He'll pressure her 
 into having the kid. 
 - Maybe he'll counsel her too. 
 - How'd he find out? 
 She asked me to call her mom. 
 He came with her. 
 - I wish you'd told me about it. 
 - Why? 
 Because I would've tried 
 to keep him out. 
 Are those baked beans? 
 Yeah. 
 And French fries. 
 That's rank! 
 What's this? 
 Coleslaw. 
 Here's a good one. 
 What's that, mystery meat? 
 What the hell are you doing 
 operating on him? 
 Saving his life. 
 You jerk. 
 Get me a gown and gloves now! 
 Peter, get your hands 
 out of my patient! 
 - Give me a little suction here. 
 - Sucker's clogged. 
 Yeah. It's a cranberry. 
 Let's go, Shirley, gloves! 
 - Where the hell is she? 
 - Who? 
 Who do you think? 
 What'd you do, give her extra work? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Step away. 
 - Fine. 
 - Who gave you permission to start? 
 - He was going into septic shock. 
 - You are a Resident. 
 You don't take a piss 
 without permission. 
 Where the hell's Lizzie? 
 Off doing your scut? 
 She left an hour ago. 
 What'd you use to make this incision? 
 A chain saw? 
 He's been drinking. 
 - What? 
 - He's drunk. 
 Go. Call Anspaugh now. 
 Retract the bowel. 
 Retract the bowel, please. 
 Have you been drinking? 
 Are you questioning 
 my surgical fitness? 
 - How many drinks have you had? 
 - Go to hell. 
 I'm gonna ask you 
 to step back, please. 
 - Sponge. 
 - Dr. Romano! 
 - Touch me again, I'll deck you. 
 - Look, you're drunk! 
 All right, Shirley. 
 Get me some clean gloves and a gown. 
 Coming right up. 
 - Who ordered all this stuff? 
 - What is it? 
 Pizza, beer, brandy, 
 whole bunch of spices... 
 The provisions have arrived. 
 How much do I owe? 
 $   , plus a tip. 
 - What's going on? 
 - Christmas party. 
 - I didn't know there was one. 
 - There is now. My treat. 
 It's really crowded. Can we take 
 this stuff into the lounge? 
 Grouch. 
 Thanks, guys. 
 Remember to punch out 
 before boozing. Thanks. 
 - Why do we need brandy and spices? 
 - Hot toddies. 
 - Sultan of Jahore's favorite. 
 - Lf it's good enough for him... 
 Yeah, make mine a double. 
 - Jerry, where's my lab coat? 
 - It was here a minute ago. 
 Where did it go? 
 - I don't even want to hazard a guess. 
 - That's a wise choice, Jerry. 
 I admit it. 
 There's no such thing as miracles. 
 You don't really believe that. 
 I don't know what I believe. 
 I was so sure that I was right. 
 That I had the Big Kahuna on my side. 
 - That's pretty arrogant, huh? 
 - Very. 
 What's going on? 
 Apparently, Mrs. Richards bumped 
 into the Mikamis in the hallway... 
 ...and they got to talking. 
 She consented to the liver transplant. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Before you give Him all the credit 
 you should know something. 
 - What? 
 - I introduced them. 
 What do you know? 
 You're an instrument of God. 
 Oh, please. 
 Sorry. 
 How sorry? 
 Well... 
 Not sorry enough to go to Mass 
 tonight, if that's what you mean. 
 What I don't understand is... 
 ...how I can care so much for a 
 hot-tempered, pig-headed heathen. 
 I'd prefer ""pagan."" 
 Heathen. 
 I'm finishing up 
 my disciplinary report... 
 ...recommending you be terminated... 
 ...for operating without an Attending. 
 - You turn that in, I'll defend myself. 
 - Well, good luck, Peter. 
 I'll have to turn in these labs 
 showing your blood alcohol was.  . 
 You shouldn't have been driving, 
 let alone operating. 
 Don't bluff me, Peter. 
 You didn't draw my blood. 
 Not from there. 
 Mark, look here! 
 - Gotcha. 
 - These hot toddies are delicious. 
 - I want the recipe. 
 - No problem. 
 Hey, Jerry. Want to try one 
 of Dr. Lee's hot toddies? 
 Just give me a beer. 
 - Christian soul out of this world. 
 In the name of God the Father 
 who created you. 
 In the name of Jesus Christ 
 who redeemed you. 
 In the name of the Holy Spirit 
 who sanctifies you...

 No, Luke.

 We are     charts behind in coding. 
 I haven't done one QA. 
 Pull yourself together. Prove your mettle

 Sixteen-year-old driver, MVA,

 - No. 
 I'll take this off. Don't move. 
 I've had my license two weeks. 
 This is the first time he let me drive it. 
 - Any pain here? 
 - No. 
 - Look at me. Look at the nurse. 
 - I'm okay. 
 - Can I use the phone? 
 - Soon as the doctor's done. 
 Neck is clear. Roll away from me. 
 We'll get you off this board.

 It's a '   Mustang,

 I'm sure your father

 - You don't know my father. 
 - Chest is clear. Does this hurt? 
 - Here? 
 - I think the belt caught me there. 
 It's a good thing you were wearing it. 
 CBC, chest x-ray... 
 ...abdominal CT 
 and a surgical consult. 
 - Hit the brakes. I can't believe this. 
 - Insurance will pay. 
 - They can't fix a classic. 
 - They can. 
 Eli, look at me. 
 We call them accidents for a reason. 
 You might think this is a big deal, 
 but it'll be okay. 
 Really. 
 Can I get some extra napkins 
 and more water, please? 
 - Morning, ladies. 
 - No offense, but you look like hell. 
 If you haven't noticed, we're short. 
 - Yeah, it's been pretty quiet. 
 - For you maybe. 
 - Come on, Kate. You gotta finish. 
 - So you got them into daycare? 
 Yeah. They usually 
 don't take them this early. 
 They're just advanced 
 for their age. 
 I couldn't afford a nanny anymore. 
 Sweetie? A couple bites. 
 - I don't blame her. 
 - What? 
 - What is that? 
 - Rice cereal. She likes it. 
 - Yeah, I can see. 
 - She's mad because I fed Tess first. 
 - Come on, Kate, we're gonna be late. 
 - Here, let me try. 
 Good luck. 
 This one's gonna give me gray hair. 
 - Just wait till she's   . 
 - Oh, yeah. 
 - Oh, how gorgeous! 
 - Oh, thank you. 
 - Girls? 
 - Yeah. 
 Oh, they look like angels. 
 Yeah, looks can be deceiving. 
 I don't believe that. No, I don't. 
 You don't give your mommy and daddy 
 any trouble, do you? Beautiful family. 
 - Yes, it is. Aidan, please. 
 - Quit it. 
 - He pushed me. 
 - Wyatt, stop. Wyatt! 
 Wait. Are these all your children? 
 - Yes. 
 - No wonder you collapsed. 
 BP's a little low at   /  , 
 tachy at    . 
 - Wyatt, come here! 
 - A candy bar's stuck. I can get it. 
 - Come here. 
 - Babysitting? 
 LOC at a grocery store. 
 Couldn't leave them. 
 Here, try this. 
 - Say thank you, Wyatt. 
 - Thanks. 
 - You're welcome. Where we going? 
 - Exam  . Abrasion to the temple. 
 - I think I hit my head on a shelf. 
 - Mommy, mommy. 
 - Have you fainted before? 
 - No. 
 - I was feeling dizzy. I'm just tired. 
 - She vomited and has double vision. 
 Mouth and lips are dry. 
 - Is that bad? 
 - Probably just dehydration. 
 - I think his diaper's leaking. 
 - I'm sorry. He pulls at it sometimes. 
 - I got two. 
 - You have to share. 
 - These are mine. 
 - Share it with him. 
 Your dad's nurse is on the phone. 
 - Okay. You got this? 
 - I think so. 
 - Here. You wanna get down? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Tech support was gonna fix this. 
 - I paged them twice. 
 - Which line? 
 - Two. 
 - I can't get labs. 
 - Usually Dr. Weaver yells at them. 
 Don't worry about what he says. 
 Mark, do you know where 
 the extra T-sheets are? 
 There's no abdominal pain 
 or shortness of breath. 
 It's Kerry's system. 
 - How long's the suspension gonna last? 
 - Grab a general adult form. 
 Listen, I understand that, of course. 
 No one is questioning 
 your qualifications. 
 He is? Let me speak to him. 
 - Call for surgical consult? 
 - Trauma Two. 
 Tell him I wanna speak to him. 
 Tell him that I said to knock it off. 
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Fredriksson. 
 Just bear with me, okay? 
 I'll be home tonight and we'll 
 straighten this out. Thank you. 
 - Everything all right? 
 - Yeah, fine. 
 - We're out of the general forms. 
 - Go back to the old charts. 
 Do we have a forwarding 
 address for Lucy? 
 - She got something? 
 - The Matching Program. 
 They forgot to pull her application. 
 Yeah, so some hospital thinks 
 she'll work for them next year. 
 - Call them. 
 - Should we send it to her mom? 
 - I don't know. 
 - What should I do with it? 
 - I'll take care of it. 
 - Carter, are you sure-? 
 - No, I got it. 
 - All right. 
 He's so cute. 
 - I can do that. You don't have to. 
 - It's not a problem. 
 I feel a lot better already. 
 Ian, put that down. 
 - Come here, please. I said, come here. 
 - Four kids under  . That's ambitious. 
 Five, the baby's home. 
 I asked you to please stop, didn't I? 
 Stop that. 
 You're just exhausted. 
 But we're still gonna do a head CT. 
 - That's enough. 
 - And I'm giving you some saline. 
 - What's a CT? 
 - It's a picture of your brain. 
 A volunteer down in Pedes 
 agreed to watch the kids. 
 - I don't wanna be any trouble. 
 - It's no trouble. 
 You kids wanna go play? 
 - No. 
 - We've got Nintendo. 
 ""Super Smash Bros. ""? 
 I don't know. 
 They got something with a gorilla. 
 - Wyatt, hold Emily's hand. 
 - Okay. 
 - Follow your brother. 
 - Bye. 
 Okay, guitar. I need the guitar. 
 - Thank you. 
 - We're gonna have a lot of fun. 
 Okay, here you go. 
 Let's go. 
 - How do you do it? 
 - One day at a time. 
 - Good bowel sounds. Any nausea? 
 - No. 
 - There's no guarding or rebound. 
 - There was before. 
 Eli, what happened? 
 - I had an accident. 
 - With the car? 
 - I lost control- 
 - How fast were you going? 
 - I don't know! 
 - It's okay. Don't worry about it. 
 - The car is bad. 
 - No big deal. 
 - I'm Dr. Finch. 
 - What's wrong with him? 
 We may need to perform exploratory 
 surgery to rule out internal injury. 
 - Oh, God... 
 - That's not necessary. 
 - You don't know? 
 - We'll observe him. 
 Let's keep him NPO 
 and check his CBC every six hours. 
 - Sure. You have a minute? 
 - Yep. 
 I'll do whatever it takes to replace it. 
 I promise. 
 I don't care about the car. 
 I can get another. 
 - He has a lap belt injury. 
 - Let's wait on the CT. 
 CT is only    percent sensitive. 
 You should explore him. 
 - No peritoneal signs. 
 - He did. 
 You asked for a surgical opinion. 
 I've given you one. 
 Let me know what the CT shows. 
 - ICON is positive. She's pregnant. 
 - The woman with the kids? 
 Yeah, eight weeks. 
 There's ketones in her urine. 
 No time to eat. 
 I guess this wasn't planned. 
 Maybe she wants a softball team. 
 - She already go to CT? 
 - Five minutes ago. 
 Call Radiology and talk to her 
 about her diet. 
 Carol, do we have 
 any Materna vitamins? 
 Try drug lockup. 
 Can you sign for central-line kits? 
 - Sure. Where? 
 - Right there. 
 Now sign out three cases 
 and put two and initial. 
 It's a game I play. 
 I need two, so I ask for three. 
 - So every time- 
 - Don't ask, Mark. I get what I need. 
 Okay, whatever it takes. 
 Thanks. Maybe I'll have you sign off 
 on crash carts too. 
 Bring it on. I'm easy. 
 Hey, Carol. 
 Can you give a dose of Levaquin? 
 - Sure. 
 - Did the girls settle in? 
 - They seem to like it? 
 - I don't know. They're babies. 
 I'd worry about the staff. 
 ""The Hathaway twins hit daycare. "" 
 - Ross. Their last name is Ross. 
 - Right. 
 - Sorry. 
 - No, don't worry. They're fine. 
 Good. Good. 
 And run in a liter of saline. 
 Okay. 
 - Mr. Simpson? 
 - Yes. 
 Dr. Kovac. 
 You experience some chest pain? 
 It's not really pain. It feels tight. 
 - How long does it last? 
 - Few seconds. 
 I think I'm having anxiety att*cks. 
 I can't breathe, 
 my heart starts pounding. 
 - History of heart disease? 
 - No. 
 - What brings it on? 
 - I'm going through a bad divorce. 
 I see. Does the pain move 
 anywhere else? 
 I got aches and pains all over. 
 She gets up every morning thinking 
 how she can screw with me. 
 Okay, let's get a   -lead EKG 
 and draw cardiac labs. 
 - You married, doc? 
 - No. 
 Stay that way. 
 It's not enough she bankrupts me... 
 - ... she's putting me in the grave. 
 - We'll see what we can do. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 There. 
 Looks like a good heartbeat. 
 By the time one gets to sleep, 
 another one's hungry or needs changing. 
 Or somebody's into something 
 he shouldn't be. 
 Do you have any help? 
 My husband works a lot. 
 You should see our grocery bill. 
 Well, you have to take 
 better care of yourself. 
 You're malnourished. 
 You have to eat more and take vitamins. 
 Did you know you were pregnant? 
 How long have you known? 
 I don't know. 
 Have you told your husband? 
 No. 
 - And you were fasting? 
 - No! I don't have time to eat. 
 You weren't starving yourself 
 to induce a miscarriage, were you? 
 We both wanted a big family. 
 I just thought I'd get a break. 
 Your body protects the fetus first. 
 But you're putting your 
 own heart and kidneys at risk. 
 Were you trying to terminate? 
 There are safer ways to do that. 
 Have you considered an abortion? 
 I can't have another baby right now. 
 I just can't. 
 - Another Webril. 
 - Poor guy slips, breaks his neck. 
 This woman falls down concrete steps 
 and cracks her wrist. 
 The benefits of alcohol consumption. 
 I could do with a margarita. 
 I don't remember the last time 
 I had a drink. 
 It's the ""no caffeine"" 
 I couldn't deal with. 
 - Thanks, Mark. 
 - Three-inch roll. 
 I'm thinking of weaning them. 
 It's been six months. I don't know 
 how much longer I can deal. 
 - I can't believe you've lasted this long. 
 - So I'm not a terrible mother? 
 If you planned on being 
 the perfect parent, fail now... 
 ...while they can't remember. 
 Another three-inch. 
 You okay? 
 - They deserve a father, Mark. 
 - Doug's been seeing them. 
 He asked me to move to Seattle again. 
 And I think he's serious this time. 
 What did you tell him? 
 - Do you have a second? 
 - Go ahead. I got this. 
 Okay. 
 - What's up? 
 - She was starving herself to miscarry. 
 - ""Supermom""? 
 - I may have talked her into an abortion. 
 - She didn't ask for one? 
 - She's scared. 
 Come here. 
 - She doesn't want her husband to know. 
 - Refer her to the GYN clinic. 
 I offered to arrange things 
 for her upstairs. Today. 
 - What's the rush? 
 - This might be her only opportunity. 
 - She can't get out of the house? 
 - She needed me to make it happen. 
 She's not in a state 
 to make her own decision? 
 - No, she just needed a push. 
 - And you pushed her? 
 - I don't know. 
 - Did you give her options? 
 Yes. The husband won't let her adopt 
 out. It's gonna push her over the edge. 
 If she's gone to this much trouble 
 to avoid an abortion... 
 ...there's a part of her 
 that has a problem with it. 
 Or her husband does. 
 - Can GYN even do it? 
 - I haven't asked them. 
 All right. Talk to them. 
 It might not even be possible. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Be careful, Abby. Make sure. 
 - Your surgical consult is here. 
 - And who might that be? 
 - How about a clue? 
 - Dr. Romano? 
 Okay. See? 
 Need a doctor to take a look? 
 Don't worry about me. 
 I'm getting some Lasix. 
 - Belt injury? 
 - CT is clear. But he's guarding. 
 You know, just discussing a patient. 
 I could use a discussion. 
 - Maybe I should see the patient. 
 - Good idea. 
 Eli, Mr. Emerson, this is Dr. Benton. 
 He's a surgeon. 
 - How's your belly? 
 - A little sore. 
 - Does this hurt? 
 - Only when you press hard. 
 - Any back pain? 
 - No. 
 - His white count is up. 
 - Was the other surgeon wrong? 
 - What other surgeon? 
 - Dr. Corday. 
 Could you give us a second? 
 - Elizabeth saw him? 
 - I didn't get a chance to tell you. 
 I disagreed with her. 
 I wanted a second opinion. 
 His belly is fairly benign. 
 No back or flank pain. 
 - He could have a bowel leak. 
 - There's no fever. 
 Delay can raise mortality 
 from five to    percent. 
 Okay. I'll do an ex-lap, okay? 
 Thank you, Peter. 
 - One, two, three. 
 - Oh, God! Watch my back, would you? 
 How far did you fall? 
 - Six, eight feet. 
 - Coworkers said four. 
 Four, my ass! I felt a pop. 
 I think I blew out a disk. 
 Complains of leg weakness, LOC. 
 I passed out. Everything went black. 
 BP's    /  . Pulse   . 
 - Is that bad? 
 - That's normal. 
 Press on my hands with your feet. 
 Jeez! 
 - That hurt? 
 - Yeah! What do you think? 
 Does your employer cover 
 on-the-job injury? 
 - He better. 
 - I'm gonna press down. 
 Tell me if it increases 
 the pain in your back. 
 - Oh, stop, stop! 
 - Pain is MU. 
 - What's that? 
 - We're gonna check it all out. 
 Better get a CBC 
 and a lumbar-spine series. 
 - What exactly is MU? 
 - Made-up. 
 - You think he's faking? 
 - Oh, yeah. 
 Hey. So is it anxiety att*cks? 
 I'm not sure. 
 But your cardiac enzymes are normal. 
 And I'm not seeing 
 irregularities on the EKG. 
 - I didn't think it was my heart. 
 - You might be stressed. 
 I could've told you that. 
 I still need to monitor you 
 for six hours to eight hours. 
 You said everything was okay. 
 Heart damage may not 
 show up right away. 
 The way you came in, 
 I wanna make sure. 
 I just got myself all worked up. 
 You see, she's... 
 She's driving me crazy. 
 I never wanted a divorce. 
 - Hell... 
 - Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson. 
 Every time. I'm sorry. 
 It just hits me. 
 I don't know what I'm doing. 
 I'm sorry. 
 - No, don't worry. It's okay. 
 - Every day... 
 Every day another damn letter 
 or phone call from her lawyer. 
 More threats, more demands. 
 I don't know what I did wrong. 
 I love my son. 
 I loved her, I still do. 
 I understand. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not your problem. 
 Maybe I can get a clinical 
 psychologist to talk to you. 
 Clinical psychologist? 
 That worse than the ordinary kind? 
 Hi. 
 I checked on your kids. 
 They're having a great time. 
 They need to eat. 
 They're eating now. 
 Kids don't complain about hospital food. 
 You sure this is what you want? 
 No, it's not what I want. 
 It's what I need. 
 Okay. I worked it out with GYN. 
 There's a doctor who can 
 squeeze you in now. 
 Take me up before I change my mind. 
 Yeah. Well, the thing is... 
 ...I'd hate for you to change 
 your mind later on. 
 No, I know. 
 I meant... Forget it. 
 No, tell me. 
 I feel like such a hypocrite. 
 I know that this is so wrong. 
 I keep telling myself I'm doing 
 this for my family. 
 Maybe you better take more time. 
 My husband is a good man 
 but he'd never understand. 
 It's better if he doesn't know. 
 Let's just get it over with. 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 This isn't easy to do alone. 
 An hour of continuous nebs 
 should do it. 
 - It's that nurse. 
 - Now what? 
 - Your dad made racial slurs. 
 - She's Swedish. 
 - Maybe he called her a meatball. 
 - Say I'm on my way. 
 I put the shoulder back in. 
 Check the films. 
 - Does he have an orthopedist? 
 - Give it to Ortho. 
 - You leaving? 
 - I've been on since  :  . 
 Can you take Exam  ? 
 - Yeah, sure. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Pull these. 
 - You have a critical value. 
 White count's    ,   : leukemia. 
 - Who? 
 - Fazio. 
 - Workers' comp guy? 
 - What? 
 He fell off a ladder. 
 Look,   % blasts. 
 - Get a Hema-Onc consult. 
 - Where's Carol? 
 - Upstairs. 
 - Again? 
 - She's on break. 
 - Again? 
 - Are you a hall monitor? 
 - I need an NG tube. 
 - So do it. 
 - You let this go on? 
 - Let her be. 
 - The chief wouldn't. 
 You try raising two children. 
 Why should I suffer? 
 - Quit whining. I'll do it. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Where's my MVA? 
 - Cleo's? 
 - Yes. 
 - Benton took him. 
 - Benton? 
 - Yeah. 
 Hey. How are you feeling? 
 Something's wrong. 
 I'm having back spasms. 
 The x-ray shows no fractures. 
 - But I still have pain. 
 - I'm sure you do. 
 - I can't work like this. 
 - You're not going to work. 
 Yeah? For how long? 
 You have acute 
 myelogenous leukemia. 
 Leukemia? You mean like the cancer? 
 - Yes. And it can cause bone pain. 
 - Come on. Get out of here! 
 - I fell down! 
 - It's in your blood. 
 Hematology will admit you... 
 - ... and start chemo. 
 - Wait a second. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - We need you now. 
 - I'll be back. 
 - Doc! 
 I'll be right back. 
 - Push.   epi. 
 - What is it? 
 - Ten-year-old in shock. 
 - No response to albuterol. 
 - Allergies? 
 - Peanuts. Pressure's dropping. 
 Draw    ketamine,    sux. 
 - Pulse ox   . 
 - Start rapid induction. 
 No, I've got it. 
 BP is    palp. 
 - Come on. Let's go. 
 - Hold on. 
 - You want cricoid pressure? 
 - I can't pass it. 
 Set up for fiber-optic intubation. 
 mg of Solu-Medrol. 
 - Okay, out of the way. 
 - I've got it. 
 - You've done one? 
 - Two. 
 - Keep gentle tension. 
 - I know. I'm feeding it in. 
 - There's the epiglottis. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Keep going. 
 - I can't see. 
 - Pulse ox   . 
 - Bag her. 
 - I just need to- 
 - I said, get out. 
 - What? I almost had it. 
 - I'm taking over. 
 John! 
 - Up to   . 
 - All right. Let's go again. 
 - Thank you. He'll be better tomorrow. 
 - He couldn't be worse. 
 Is she gone? 
 Yeah, okay? She's gone. 
 - We'll be lucky if she returns. 
 - Says you. 
 We need her. 
 Someone has to be here. 
 Not if I went to the hospice. 
 You'd be surrounded by strangers. 
 No stranger than Nurse Von B√ºlow. 
 And look at this room. 
 It's like a damn hospital! 
 - How much is this costing? 
 - Don't worry. 
 - What the hell is that? 
 - A portable toilet. 
 - You got me a Johnny-on-the-spot? 
 - It's just for convenience. 
 I am not taking a dump 
 in your living room, Mark! 
 I am not an invalid! 
 I can still make it to the bathroom! 
 Dad. Sit down. Come on, sit down. 
 - Sit and relax. 
 - This is what I didn't want happening. 
 - Relax. 
 - I won't use it. 
 I'll get your albuterol, okay? 
 I'll take it back, all right? 
 Here. Just take a few puffs. 
 Nice and easy. Calm down. 
 - Where is he? 
 - The suit. 
 - Mr. Parker? I'm Abby. 
 - Hi. You're taking care of my wife? 
 Yes. She was a little dehydrated 
 and tired. 
 She came by ambulance. 
 It's standard when patients 
 lose consciousness. 
 - God. 
 - It's okay. 
 Mostly, she just needs to rest. 
 She overdoes it. 
 She does too much. 
 - You should get her some help at home. 
 - Yeah. Can I see her? 
 - She went upstairs for tests. 
 - What kind of tests? 
 She was anemic. 
 We checked her heart and blood. 
 - Let's find your kids. 
 - Okay. 
 - But she only needs rest. 
 - She does. We're being thorough. 
 - I should be there. 
 - That'd be difficult. 
 - What's all this? 
 - I've got an ex-lap. 
 - Were you going to call me? 
 - I didn't know I needed permission. 
 Did your friend tell you 
 I'd examined the patient? 
 - Dr. Finch advised me of your opinion. 
 - I bet she did. 
 - I made my assessment. 
 - That boy is asymptomatic... 
 - ... except for a bruise. 
 - His white count rose. 
 - She should've called me. 
 - You'd made up your mind. 
 I was observing him. 
 She may not be as comfortable 
 with me as you... 
 ...but I might have changed my mind. 
 Maybe. 
 Stop scrubbing. 
 - What? 
 - You heard me, I said stop. 
 - I'm operating on him. 
 - No, you're not. I am. 
 - I'm ready. 
 - Sorry to have wasted your time. 
 It's my prerogative 
 to schedule cases... 
 ...especially ones I've seen first. 
 - You mean you're pulling rank on me? 
 - Absolutely. 
 - Carter? 
 - Yeah. 
 Dan Shine. 
 You sent me a patient for a biopsy. 
 - How'd it go? 
 - His bone marrow is normal. 
 - No. He had   % blasts. 
 - Someone else did. He's normal. 
 What? 
 They mixed up records. 
 Do you have a patient named Simpson? 
 - Can you find Dr. Kovac? 
 - Just a second. 
 No, now! 
 - Did you talk to him? 
 - You might want to go up. 
 I stuck him, 
 then told him we were wrong. 
 That he wouldn't die. 
 He wants to sue. 
 I'm sure he did. 
 Excuse me? They took my wife up. 
 I wanted to see if she was back. 
 The name's Parker. 
 Gynecology Clinic. 
 Wait. Gynecology Clinic? 
 I thought she was anemic. 
 I didn't take care of her. 
 You can wait right over there. 
 - Call me if you find Simpson. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Excuse me, what's your name? 
 - Abby. 
 Abby, yeah. It says ""GYN"" 
 by my wife's name. Is that right? 
 Why don't you have a seat? 
 I'll check. 
 - Is there something wrong? 
 - No, she's fine. 
 Why is she in Gynecology? 
 Is she pregnant? 
 You should wait. 
 I don't want to wait anymore! 
 Tell me what's wrong with her. 
 - I can't. 
 - Why? 
 Medical information is private. 
 It's my wife. What can't I know? 
 - Mr. Parker- 
 - Is she having an abortion? 
 - Is she? 
 - I can't say. 
 What floor is Gynecology on? 
 - What floor is Gynecology on?! 
 - Ninth. 
 - You needed me, Carter? 
 - Yeah. 
 - You're sure it's not another mistake? 
 - We double-checked. 
 How long? 
 - It's hard for me to say. 
 - Ballpark, best guess. 
 With a bone-marrow transplant... 
 ...there's a    percent survival rate 
 at five years. 
 Without one? 
 Chemotherapy alone? 
 About half of that. 
 We'll do what we can 
 to find a match. 
 Type your family: brothers, sisters- 
 I don't have any brothers or sisters. 
 - Are your parents living? 
 - I have an uncle. 
 That's good. 
 And your son. 
 He's only  . 
 Probably the best chance. 
 I should call my wife. 
 Yeah. 
 - You called for a consult? 
 - Yeah. Abdominal pain. 
 - A hot appy. 
 - Didn't bring them to the O.R. yourself? 
 - Temp's    . 
 - I just closed Eli Emerson's belly. 
 - I thought Peter was- 
 - No, he was my consult. 
 - There's no perforation. 
 - What a relief. 
 - Pity I had to cut him open. 
 - Better to know than regret it later. 
 Yes. 
 You may have special access 
 to Peter... 
 ...but from now on, 
 come to me if you have a problem. 
 Obviously you agreed with him. 
 - ""Yes, Elizabeth,"" will do. 
 - Do you want this? 
 - Which room? 
 - Four. 
 - Hey, what's going on? 
 - They took all my stuff. 
 The city swept his street. 
 - When was your last drink? 
 - I tried to get up on a dumpster. 
 - They pushed me down. 
 - How much have you had? 
 They took my pillows. 
 I had a tarp for rain. 
 - Have you eaten? 
 - No money. 
 Let's get a banana bag. 
 CBC and blood alcohol. 
 - Did you hit your head? 
 - What? 
 - Did you hit your head? 
 - Hold still, Pablo. 
 - Let me go. 
 - Hold still. 
 No. 
 - Soft restraints. 
 - It's okay. 
 - Call Security. 
 - It was an accident. Pablo, be still. 
 - What's that? 
 - Haldol. 
 - What? No! 
 - Let me go. 
 - Carter, what are you doing? 
 - No. Carter. 
 - What's wrong? 
 - He's violent. 
 It was an accident. 
 They don't come any gentler. 
 - Are you going to help? 
 - No! 
 All right, fine. 
 Call me when he calms down. 
 - You got any four-by-fours in here? 
 - Let me check. 
 - Xeroform, Adaptic... 
 - If not, in the suture room. 
 Hold on, I'm still looking. 
 Here we go. 
 - What's going on? 
 - What, with Pablo? 
 Your overreaction to Pablo. 
 Or am I now overreacting? 
 I was being careful. 
 Maybe it was a bad call. 
 - Are you okay? 
 - Yeah, I think so. 
 I know what it's like 
 to have life change. 
 A year ago I was living with Doug. 
 Now I'm living alone with two babies. 
 Go figure. 
 - Yeah. 
 - It takes a while to deal with it... 
 ...to get used to it. 
 You still need to get used to it. 
 - Lucy matched. 
 - Oh, God. Where? 
 Here. Got a spot in Psych. 
 Go figure. 
 There's always gonna be something. 
 Well, what are you gonna do? 
 Go back to work. 
 - She's not really Swedish. 
 - What? 
 Fredriksson. She's married to a Swede. 
 She's Dutch. 
 - So you did talk to her. 
 - No, I didn't talk. 
 She yapped and yapped. 
 Finally, about halfway through 
 watching Rosie O 'Donnell... 
 ...I said to stick her thumb 
 in her dike and shut up. 
 - You didn't. 
 - Sure, I did. 
 To stick her thumb in her dike? 
 She got what I meant. 
 And it worked. Not another word. 
 - What is this? 
 - Meatloaf. 
 The only recipe of Mom's 
 I remember. 
 - Where's the egg? 
 - What egg? 
 Your mom cooked it with an egg. 
 You'd get a sliver per slice. 
 I forgot. 
 I never much liked the egg, 
 always ate around it. 
 Okay. 
 - Work was pretty decent today. 
 - That's good. 
 So anything happen here? 
 Like what? 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe you and she did something. 
 What the hell would we do? 
 Play Parcheesi? 
 Dad, forget it. Okay? 
 I was just making conversation. 
 Yeah, okay. Whatever. 
 Your mom served it with peas. 
 Not with string beans. 
 Yeah. I guess so. 
 - Hey, Abby. 
 - Hey. 
 How's she doing? 
 - Pretty well. She's gonna be okay. 
 - That's good. 
 I want to apologize. 
 I let my emotions get the best of me. 
 Of course. 
 Lynn let herself get rundown. 
 She just got depressed. 
 I guess I didn't see. 
 It's easy for that to happen. 
 She's resting now. 
 I'm gonna check on my kids. 
 Sure. 
 - Hi, how are you doing? 
 - I'm okay. 
 - I saw your husband. 
 - He was upset, but he's better now. 
 He forgave me. 
 - He forgave you? 
 - We all make mistakes sometimes. 
 What you did today 
 was a mistake? 
 He didn't call it that. 
 Just a moment of weakness. 
 - Well, what do you think? 
 - He talked to a doctor. I'll be fine. 
 - We'll be able to try again soon. 
 - For another baby? 
 Ken's a wonderful father. 
 We both love kids. 
 We've always wanted a big family. 
 Kids are great. 
 - Why don't you rest, okay? 
 - Thanks. 
 - Look at Kate's hat. She's so cute. 
 - Isn't that Tess? 
 Nope. Tess is the one eating the hat. 
 - Hey, Luka. You off? 
 - No. 
 Heading out to meet a trauma. You? 
 - After I pick up the girls. 
 - Isn't that adorable? 
 Yeah. Very beautiful. 
 - See you. 
 - Bye. 
 - Has anyone seen Benton? 
 - I think he crashed. 
 - Oh, God! Dr. Kovac... 
 - What? 
 - He had two children. Two, wasn't it? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. Where are the girls? 
 I'm on my way up to get them. 
 How much longer are you on? 
 If Romano has his way, 
 probably forever. 
 Luka, I just realized, 
 looking at those pictures... 
 I've never seen 
 any pictures of your children. 
 - You want to see one? 
 - That'd be great. 
 Jasna. That was her birthday party. 
 She was  . 
 - She's beautiful. So is your wife. 
 - Yeah, she was. 
 - Can I see your son? 
 - I don't have any. 
 You don't have any now, or at all? 
 I'm lucky to have this. 
 No, to see Marco... 
 ...I just have to close my eyes 
 and he's there. 
 Usually with chocolate ice cream 
 on his face and hands. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - No, no, no. Thank you for asking. 
 Oh, here I go. Back to work. 
 - See you tomorrow. 
 - Bye. 
 - What is it? 
 - It's me. 
 Cleo. 
 - What's wrong? 
 - Nothing. Lie down. 
 - I thought you were going home. 
 - Maybe later. 
 This is okay for now. 
 Dr. John. I thought the dog got in. 
 No, it's just me, Corrine. 
 - Couldn't sleep? 
 - No. 
 - You want me to make something? 
 - I'm fine. Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 - Good night. 
 - Good night. 
 Mark! 
 Mark! 
 - Dad? 
 - Mark! 
 Just a second. 
 - What's wrong? 
 - I told you this would get in the way. 
 What happened? 
 I was trying to go to the bathroom. 
 I got tangled up in these. 
 - Damn! 
 - I should've moved this stuff. 
 I should be able to go to 
 the bathroom by myself. 
 It's my fault. 
 I didn't leave a lamp on. 
 I tried. But I got tangled up... 
 It's no big deal, Dad. 
 My pajamas are soaked! 
 Well, don't worry. 
 I haven't wet the bed 
 since I was  ! 
 All right. Just sit down here, okay? 
 I'll put the shower on. 
 You shouldn't have to do this, Mark. 
 Think how many times 
 you did this for me when I was little. 
 Well, I'm a grown man. 
 Whoa, wait, wait. 
 This isn't right, Mark.

 You still need to take it easy. 
 You seem to have taken on several 
 additional responsibilities in my absence. 
 Romano told me 
 to keep this place running. 
 I don't usually do this. 
 - Bring somebody home. 
 - Trust me. I don't either. 
 Lool, I appointed you Associate Chief... 
 ...so that I have a lieutenant 
 on the front lines that I could count on. 
 Now, you want to be barefoot 
 and pregnant in the kitchen, 
 you have my blessing, go forth and multiply. 
 - How old are you? 
 - Twenty. 
 - In September. 
 - She's a teenager. 
 - Carter. 
 - I didn't know. 
 - I like you a lot, Rena. 
 - You wish I was older. 
 Can't keep me here. I need to go! 
 You've got to let me go. 
 My kids are coming home from school. 
 I meet them at the bus stop 
 at  :   every day. 
 Relax. It's only    in the morning. 
 My icebox is empty. 
 I've got nothing to cook for dinner. 
 You're in the hospital, ma'am. 
 We're going to take care of you. 
 I could get some ground chuck. 
 But they want    cents a pound. 
 - Peter! 
 - Have you heard of such a thing? 
 I remember paying    cents a pound. 
 - Where have you been? 
 - Don't even think about T-bone. 
 I had to put a Swan in upstairs. 
 This the consult? 
 - Mrs. Howard. 
 - So, what's the problem? 
 Nursing home sent her in 
 because she's not eating. 
 Doesn't sound surgical. 
 Could be. You took out 
 her gallbladder last month. 
 - But there's macaroni and cheese. 
 - Hello, Mrs. Howard. 
 - So nice to see you. 
 - I'm Dr. Benton. 
 I know. I never forget 
 a handsome face. 
 - Simon? 
 - She's afebrile. 
 I've ordered a hemogram... 
 Simon! Simon! 
 Simon! 
 - Who are you? 
 - Simon! 
 Are you Simon? No? 
 Yosh, you seen a little guy 
 running through here? 
 - Sorry. 
 - Hey, Carter. 
 - Lose something? 
 - Simon. 
 - Where's his mom? 
 - Mom went to the cafeteria... 
 ...to get some chocolate milk. 
 But Simon's not getting any treats... 
 - ... until he lets me draw his blood. 
 - I don't want you to take my blood. 
 We're only gonna take 
 about this much. 
 - If you sit still, this won't hurt. 
 - I don't want a needle. 
 - How about a papoose? 
 - I think we're okay. 
 You sure? 
 Hate for you to lose him again. 
 - Will you just hold his arm still? 
 - Okay. 
 Be brave and do not move. 
 - Good one at the wrist. 
 - Antecube looks better. 
 No! 
 - Want to try an arm board? 
 - No. Let's take a break. 
 Abby, I need another nurse. 
 - You okay here? 
 - Go. 
 - He kicked me in the face. 
 - We need some Haldol. 
 Careful. He bit 
 a nurse's finger in Psych. 
 - What's he doing down here? 
 - He cut up his face. 
 - You want some help? 
 - Yeah. 
 Hey! Man, what'd you do that for? 
 - It was an April Fools' joke. 
 - April Fools'? 
 Was that Haldol? 
 E.R. 
 The board is full, gurneys are lining the 
 halls, we got another    in the rack. 
 We desperately need to clear out the 
 rooms, and you're wasting your time... 
 ...on April Fools' pranks. No more 
 shenanigans for the rest of the day. 
 - Have I made myself clear? 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 - Dave! 
 - Yeah. 
 - How much did you give him? 
 - Ten milligrams. 
 - Okay. I want you to take a nap. 
 - I'm fine. 
 - What did I just say? 
 - Go take a nap. 
 - Before that? 
 - No more fooling around. 
 That's right. Now, get back to work. 
 - Malucci! 
 - It wasn't me, I swear. 
 - What? 
 - Nothing. 
 - What's the matter with him? 
 - Ten of Haldol. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 - Hey. 
 - Dr. Carter. 
 You were supposed to get this 
 after we took blood. 
 - I'm sorry. I can get another one. 
 - No. That's okay. 
 - You want another chocolate milk? 
 - No, really- 
 I don't mind. Be a good boy, Simon. 
 I'll be right back. 
 - I didn't call you down here. 
 - The nurses did. 
 - They said you were having some trouble. 
 - Not me. 
 Well, he's ready now. 
 - Malik, can you give me a hand? 
 - Yeah, sure. 
 - It's better if you don't hold onto him. 
 - Yeah. We tried that once. 
 - Ended up in the closet. 
 - Trust me. 
 Purple and a red top. 
 Okay, Simon. Are you ready? 
 You might want to give 
 Simon here a friendly hug. 
 Keep blowing bubbles, Simon. 
 Blow right through the pain, okay? 
 Fine. 
 Good. That's it. 
 - Good boy. 
 - What do you want for the labs? 
 A CBC, lytes, BUN, 
 creatinine and glucose. 
 Okay. We are done. 
 You were very brave. 
 Let me hook you up with a 
 Band-Aid, and you are good to go. 
 - Thank you. 
 - No problem. 
 - So how's your internship going? 
 - It's good. 
 Yeah? I haven't seen you 
 around lately. You been busy? 
 Yeah. 
 - I should probably get back. 
 - Nice to see you again. 
 You too. 
 Is this the trauma? 
 Yeah. Eddie Palcynski,   , 
 single g*nsh*t wound to the belly. 
 - Hypotensive initially. 
 - I take it he's not an innocent victim. 
 - Tried to hold up a liquor store. 
 - Wasn't me. That other dude had a knife. 
 - Any pain in the chest? 
 - Just my stomach. 
 - What happened to you? 
 - Chased his partner. 
 - You get him? 
 - Not exactly. 
 No, you actually 
 would have had to run. 
 - Heard you had a GSW. 
 - Right upper quadrant. 
 - Can you get this? 
 - No problem. 
 - Need a hand? 
 - Take a look at that arm injury. 
 - You just need a Band-Aid. 
 - Yeah, over your mouth. 
 - Officer? 
 - Be good, they'll give you a lollipop. 
 On my count. One, two, three... 
 - Where is my purse? I've lost my purse! 
 - Hey, who's got the screamer? 
 - Dr. Finch. Benton cleared her belly. 
 - Can we put her in a room? 
 - If we had one. 
 - Nurse, I need my wallet and car keys. 
 - Nice outfit you got there, Randi. 
 - Thanks, Dr. Carter. 
 - I can't go anywhere without my keys! 
 - You look nice too. 
 So are you Dr. Carter 
 now or Mr. Hyde? 
 I'm sorry about that. I guess 
 I just needed a cup of coffee. 
 And I suppose seeing Miss Bubbles 
 had nothing to do... 
 - ... with your sudden mood change? 
 - No. 
 No? Come on. You've been 
 moping around here for days. 
 And then the minute she shows up, 
 you turn into Mr. Congeniality? 
 I was just being friendly. 
 I was! 
 Did somebody order a school bus? 
 Grace Linden. 
 Stuart's having an asthma attack. 
 Get a gurney and a hand-held neb. 
 You use an inhaler? 
 - Empty. 
 - How long's he been bad? 
 About    minutes. 
 There are fumes on the bus. 
 - Exhaust fumes? 
 - No, something else. 
 - Some of the kids are throwing up. 
 - We can't bring them in. 
 It's a HAZMAT situation. Until 
 we know there's no contamination... 
 - ... you have to wait outside. 
 - In the cold? 
 A gram of cefotetan and 
 repeat the CBC in pre-op. 
 - What's this? 
 - Small-caliber g*nsh*t to the liver. 
 I want four units 
 of type-specific in the O.R. 
 - Thought Benton was on. 
 - Yeah. You need something? 
 How long's the case? 
 Couple of hepatic drains, 
 couple of sutures and we'll be done. 
 - Sounds quick. 
 - Should be. 
 Hope so. 
 - He needs     of Solu-Medrol... 
 - We are walking. We are not talking. 
 Let's get him into a gown 
 and bag his clothes. 
 Okay. Can you hop up here? 
 Stu, Stu, stupid! 
 I think you broke your ass. 
 I can see the crack. 
 When the hand goes up, 
 the mouth goes shut. 
 - Arms up. 
 - You guys on a field trip? 
 - Art Institute. 
 - Oh, yeah? The Gauguin exhibit? 
 - We never made it. 
 - Hey, nice rack, Stu. 
 - Make them bounce. 
 - Okay, that's enough! 
 Hey, doc, you do liposuction? 
 Toby, next time it is you, 
 me and the principal. 
 - Keep moving. We are walking... 
 - Don't even listen to them. 
 Anything else? 
 Some number-one chromic 
 on a liver needle. 
 Lizzie, I heard you're doing 
 an ex-lap on a GSW? 
 - You heard correctly. 
 - Sure you can still reach the table? 
 Least I can see the table. 
 Well, I was gonna offer 
 to assist after my AV shunt... 
 ...but not if you' re gonna go 
 prenatal on me. 
 Actually, if you really want to help, you 
 can order me some pizza and ice cream. 
 Think you need it? 
 - Razor wire. 
 - More like a cyclone fence. 
 - It's pretty deep. 
 - We can help you. 
 - I need to use the toilet. 
 - We're gonna move you to a quiet room. 
 I need you to 
 spread your fingers like this. 
 Dr. Weaver, we got 
 a status asthmaticus. 
 Chuny, can you help her 
 with the bedpan, please? 
 He needs continuous nebs. 
 Where do you want to put him? 
 - One second. 
 - Sit up for me, Stuart. 
 - Hey, your guy is seizing in  . 
 - Okay. 
 - Cock your wrist back like this: 
 - I'll go by myself. 
 - Can't keep me here or where to go. 
 - Stand up. 
 - You can let me go if I want to go. 
 - Hold your hands like this: 
 - A prisoner I'm not. 
 - I'm gonna press down. 
 - Just keep them up, all right? 
 - Let me go. I don't need to be here. 
 - Hey! 
 - This is not right. 
 - Drop the g*n, ma'am. 
 - Can't do this to me. 
 - Drop the g*n, ma'am. Drop it now. 
 - Just leave me alone! 
 Everybody calm down. 
 Put it down now 
 and no one will get hurt. 
 - Leave me alone! Just leave me alone! 
 - Drop the g*n. 
 Leave me- 
 blade. Set up a cell saver 
 and try for a pulse ox. 
 Central line is in. 
 - Two units on the infuser. 
 - Rib spreader. 
 - We asked three times. 
 - She didn't respond. 
 - Asystole. 
 - Start internal compressions. 
 How'd she get your g*n? 
 - What are you gonna say? 
 - Put the suction on high. 
 - We'll talk about it. 
 - Right atrium is shredded. 
 - We should figure it out. 
 - Aortic root is blown away. 
 - Guess one shot wasn't enough. 
 - Come here. 
 Another amp of epi. 
 Side-biting clamp and pick-ups. 
 I need a cordis introducer for the atrium. 
 - I need a lap pad. Let's go! 
 - Hope they get their story straight. 
 It's okay. 
 All clear. No carbon monoxide, 
 no flammables. 
 The kids smelled something? 
 Maybe, but it's gone now. 
 Probably just mass hysteria. 
 That's it? 
 Kids smell nail-polish remover, pretty 
 soon everybody thinks they're sick. 
 - Do we need to scrub them down? 
 - No one's contaminated. 
 All right. Let's split them up. 
 Who had vomiting? 
 - Me. 
 - So did I. 
 Luka, postural vitals and a pulse ox. 
 Okay. Come with me. 
 What's your name? 
 - Emily. 
 - Are you still nauseated? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Any stiff neck or double vision? 
 - No. 
 - Are you really a doctor? 
 When I'm not out fighting crime. 
 This way. 
 All right, guys. Let's go. 
 - We like it out here. 
 - They say fresh air's good for you. 
 - Put out your cigarette. 
 - You got a spare ashtray? 
 Come on. 
 - Beck's suture. 
 - Fifth and sixth units are in. 
 How's she doing? 
 Heart's empty. Not so good. 
 Looks like hamburger in here. 
 Officer Kimball, 
 did you discharge your w*apon? 
 - Go with Detective Westland. 
 - Satinsky. 
 - Officer Grant, you're with me. 
 - Push another atropine. 
 I need the names of the 
 treating physicians. 
 - Dr. Weaver. 
 -   French Foley. Let's move, people. 
 - And Dr. Benton. 
 - Okay. Inflate balloon. 
 - Did you witness the sh**ting? 
 - We both did. 
 B- E-N-T-E-N? 
 - O-N. 
 - Okay. Hold compressions. 
 - Still asystole. 
 - Is she gonna make it? 
 - Not if you don't let us do our job. 
 - Let me know if she expires. 
 - Resume compressions. 
 - You want some more blood? 
 - How long has she been down? 
 - Half an hour. 
 All right, let's get two more units, and 
 I need some more   silk. Come on. 
 Deep breath. 
 Excuse me. 
 - Once again. 
 - Is that stuff still in my lungs? 
 I don't think so. 
 Everything sounds good. 
 - What kind of chemical was it? 
 - We don't know. 
 Well, then how do you know it's safe? 
 Because your oxygen level is normal 
 and your lungs are clear. 
 Do you think it could hurt my baby? 
 You're pregnant? 
 I think so. 
 Laura Beckton,   . Put her car 
 into a fire hydrant. She's altered. 
 - This is a crime scene. 
 - We have a critical- 
 - Go around. 
 - Let us through! 
 I can't. 
 - BP,    /  . Pulse,   . 
 - What's with all the cops? 
 We had a sh**ting. Let's get X-ray 
 down here. Laura, open your eyes. 
 Pupils are equal and reactive. Let's get 
 a portable C-spine, chest and pelvis. 
 Head CT to follow. Looks like 
 Peter's patient didn't make it. 
 - What patient? 
 - Little old lady from the hall. 
 - That's my patient. 
 - Cop shot her. 
 What? 
 Feeling better? 
 Starting to. Did that lady die? 
 - Think it'll be on the news? 
 - Yeah. 
 She could have blown my head off. 
 Weren't you scared? 
 - A little. 
 - Then why'd you get in front of me? 
 Guess I wasn't thinking. 
 I was really scared. 
 Me too. 
 You're still wheezing. 
 - Have you had a cold? 
 - No. 
 Well, something triggered your asthma. 
 Think it was the fumes? 
 - Maybe. I don't know. 
 - You're not sure? 
 I'm just trying to help. 
 It was the fumes. 
 Where'd they come from? 
 You know that anything that 
 you tell me, it's a secret. 
 Another  .  proline. 
 - Shirley, can you rub my back for me? 
 - Excuse me? 
 Yeah, just above the waist 
 on the right. 
 Oh, yes. Yeah, that's it. 
 Okay. Release the vessel loop. 
 Oh, yeah. That's it. 
 I'm sorry. This must be the day spa. 
 I was looking for the O.R. 
 Everything's under control. 
 I hope so. 
 You've been in here long enough. 
 I've repaired the liver, the diaphragm 
 and now the IVC. 
 What about the defect 
 to the ascending colon? 
 Where? 
 Little lower. 
 Yeah, right there. 
 I hadn't fully run the bowel yet. 
 Or maybe this is too big a case, 
 given your delicate condition? 
 We were doing perfectly well 
 until you came in, thank you. 
 - Are you crying? 
 - No. 
 We don't cry in the O.R., 
 that's what the ladies' room is for. 
 I'm not crying! 
 Good. Then you 
 won't mind if I scrub in. 
 - Where's Malucci? 
 - He's with his new fan club. 
 - As if. 
 - Find him. 
 - Right now? 
 - No, sometime in the next two weeks. 
 - Don't be so snippy. 
 - Some kids on the bus... 
 - ... had a can of solvent. 
 - Huffing? 
 - Trying to get high. 
 - I've got a pregnant girl. 
 - What were they using? 
 - I don't know. 
 They held a rag over my patient's 
 face and forced him to take a hit. 
 - Tox screens are negative. 
 - Solvents don't show up. 
 - We need to find out. 
 - I know where to start. 
 Don't implicate Stuart. 
 He's afraid of payback. 
 - Tell him. 
 - Dr. Dave was talking to me... 
 - ... and he fell asleep in the chair. 
 - Now he's drooling. 
 Okay, Mr. Gunderson, you need 
 to change into a gown. 
 The doctor will be in to examine you. 
 Just have a seat on the... bed. 
 Dave. 
 Dave. Dave! 
 I'm good. 
 I'm good. 
 No, man. You gotta 
 stick it up his butt. 
 - Okay, guys. What were you sniffing? 
 - What? 
 - On the bus. 
 - You smell something on the bus, Eric? 
 Yeah, Mrs. Linden's farts. 
 We found chemical solvents 
 in your bloodstream. 
 Some of your classmates 
 are really sick. 
 Can I get another Band-Aid? 
 I need to know what it was. 
 Butane, paint thinner, adhesive? 
 Okay, fine. We'll do more tests. 
 Bo? Come here. 
 - What kind of tests? 
 - Just lie still, man. 
 We take the blood and label it 
 with radioactive hydrogen. 
 Then we re-inject it into your body... 
 - ... and do a nuclear scan. 
 - Really? 
 It's the only way 
 to identify the chemicals. 
 It was spot remover. 
 - What kind? 
 - Carbon tet. 
 Carbon tetrachloride? 
 Order liver panels on all three of them. 
 Got it. 
 - We gonna be okay? 
 - I hope so. 
 - Can I help you? 
 - Yeah, I'm looking for Rena. 
 She's just finishing up with a patient. 
 Dr. Carter, right? 
 - Yeah. Have we met? 
 - No. I'll let her know you're here. 
 We didn't have- We didn't... 
 - Dr. Carter? 
 - Yeah, hi. I... 
 Don't worry about it. 
 This is always falling apart. 
 Okay, actually, it goes like this. 
 Are you sure you're a doctor? 
 I was a surgical resident for a year. 
 I guess it's easier taking things out 
 than putting it back in. 
 I was waiting and I accidentally 
 eviscerated this guy. 
 I heard about the sh**ting. 
 Are you okay? 
 Did you need something? 
 I've been doing some thinking 
 about you and me. 
 And I realize that I may have been... 
 Stupid? 
 I was gonna say wrong. 
 But maybe I was a little of both. 
 Look, I enjoyed the time that we 
 spent together. I'd like to do it again. 
 So I was wondering if you 
 would have lunch with me. 
 What about the age thing? 
 Not an issue. 
 Anymore. 
 You dropped your spleen. 
 Right. So is that a no? 
 I'll think about it. 
 Okay. 
 I was just up at grand rounds. 
 Why didn't anyone get me? 
 There wasn't any time. 
 She wasn't that agitated when I left. 
 What did she want with the g*n? 
 She didn't want anything. 
 She was altered- 
 Dr. Benton, the cop is still 
 waiting for his sutures. 
 Yeah. I'll see you. 
 - Got the film. 
 - I have to get out of here now. 
 You need to sit down. You were 
 unconscious from a car accident. 
 - I'm gonna be late. 
 - For what? 
 My gynecologist. They have to 
 harvest my eggs by  :  . 
 - Are you on fertility dr*gs? 
 - Yeah. 
 I had    days of FSH injections. 
 And yesterday they gave me Beta HCG. 
 Look, I'm ovulating now. There's only a 
 two-hour window to retrieve the eggs. 
 I don't think that's 
 gonna be possible now. 
 - Why, did I damage my ovaries? 
 - Head CT looks normal. 
 We think you may have had 
 a small blood clot in your brain... 
 ...which caused you to pass out 
 and crash your car. 
 But I'm okay now? 
 We need to give you blood thinners 
 to prevent more clotting. 
 I'll go to the clinic and come back. 
 You need heparin now, which means 
 you can't have an invasive procedure. 
 When I come back, 
 you can do whatever. 
 I have to harvest these eggs. 
 - Hold on. Who's your gynecologist? 
 - Her name is Dr. Alexander. 
 Let's call her and maybe 
 she'll come here. 
 What is taking so long? 
 Have a seat. 
 Did you do the test? 
 - You are pregnant. 
 - I knew it. 
 - What about the fumes? 
 - Shouldn't be a problem. 
 Good. I want a healthy baby. 
 Have you thought about your options? 
 - What do you mean? 
 - Can you take care of a baby? 
 Well, there's daycare in high school. 
 And my mom can help out 
 until I'm in ninth grade. 
 Does your mom know? 
 - Maybe you should tell her. 
 - No. Don't tell her. 
 She'll freak out completely. 
 It's a big decision. 
 No, it's not. 
 All my life I wanted a baby. 
 She's a good cop. 
 Saved my ass a couple of times. 
 No one ever wants to draw their g*n. 
 She was forced to make... 
 - ... a split-second decision. 
 - Was she? 
 She followed the guidelines. 
 They teach you 
 to sh**t little old ladies? 
 She could have shot anyone 
 in that hallway. You know that. 
 All I know is that an elderly 
 black woman is dead. 
 No, man. Lisa's not like that at all. 
 I would have done the same thing. 
 Yeah, well... 
 Hold still. 
 You don't know her. You can trust her. 
 She's a good person. She- 
 Look. She's been raising two kids 
 on her own ever since her husband died. 
 She's had it rough. I'm telling you, 
 this investigation goes the wrong way... 
 ...you could ruin a good cop's life. 
 She was trying to protect you and 
 your patients. That's all she was doing. 
 You might want to consider that, 
 talk to these detectives. 
 I know she's in the middle of a 
 procedure. Page Dr. Alexander. 
 Have her call Dr. Greene at 
 County General. Hold on, Malik. 
 Yeah. The patient's name 
 is Laura Beckton. Thanks. 
 - Robert Borsellino? 
 - Yeah. 
 - This is Bo? 
 - Yeah. 
 We need a ProTime, 
 type and cross for four. 
 - You gonna admit him? 
 - Pedes ICU. 
 - She's in seventh grade. 
 - They're emancipated for a reason. 
 When they're pregnant, 
 you can't tell her mother. 
 - She'll have to eventually. 
 - Yes, she will. 
 Don't you think it's better 
 to tell her now? 
 - Well, yeah. I do. 
 - So you'll talk to her? 
 - What? 
 - Maybe she'll listen to you. 
 - What room? 
 - Exam  . 
 I don't need this. 
 I can just go home and rest. 
 - What we need is to find your parents. 
 - They don't get back till   or  . 
 - They have a cell phone or a pager? 
 - No. Don't even bother. 
 We really do. 
 Well, what is it? 
 You're in liver failure. 
 - How'd that happen? 
 - You need to huff pretty much... 
 - ... every day to hurt your liver. 
 - People drink every day. 
 This is worse. We have to start 
 looking for a donor. 
 A donor? 
 You could die if you don't have 
 a liver transplant. 
 Is this another one 
 of your scare tactics? 
 No. 
 Mark, Laura's crashing. 
 I'll be back. What happened? 
 - She slumped over, stopped breathing. 
 - I should have heparinized. 
 - Pavulon and sux. Let's paralyze. 
 - I don't think you have to. 
 Number   ET tube, suction. 
 No muscle tone in the legs either. 
 Blood clot knocked out the 
 corticospinal tracts. 
 She's a quadriplegic. 
 How about TPA? 
 Maybe we can bust the clot. 
 Not after a car crash. Pulmonary 
 contusions. She can bleed into her lungs. 
 Dr. Greene? I took a message. 
 Dr. Alexander can come see the patient. 
 Forget it. She stroked out. 
 And you also heard Officer Kimball 
 ask the woman to drop the w*apon? 
 Yeah. 
 What happened next? 
 Mrs. Howard was startled, 
 and she raised the g*n. 
 - Pointed at anyone in particular? 
 - No, no one specifically. 
 Okay. 
 We'll notify you 
 if we need anything else. 
 That's it? 
 Yeah. 
 - Something you'd like to add? 
 - Yeah, they could have grabbed the g*n. 
 - What makes you say that? 
 - She was a frail, frightened, demented... 
 ...elderly woman. She didn't know 
 what she was doing. 
 - But she still could have fired it. 
 - Maybe. 
 But? 
 They didn't need to sh**t her. 
 - Was she huffing? 
 - No. No. 
 I've talked to her about dr*gs. 
 But you never know. 
 I don't think she does dr*gs. 
 I shouldn't have let her go 
 on that field trip. 
 - Why? 
 - She's been sick. 
 She tells me she's been 
 throwing up every morning. 
 Could that be gallstones? 
 My mother had them. 
 Do you know 
 when was her last period? 
 I don't keep track. 
 She has a boyfriend? 
 Is she pregnant? 
 - That little slut. 
 - Mrs. Perault. 
 - How could you be so stupid? 
 - What? 
 - This is your mother? 
 - Yes. I'm her mother. 
 If you're gonna sleep around, 
 use a condom! 
 - He didn't want to. 
 - No need to shout. 
 Who is the little bastard? 
 You're getting an abortion. 
 - I am not. 
 - Yes, you are! 
 - Leave me alone. 
 - Why don't we calm down. 
 You can't take care of a baby. 
 You can't even take care of yourself! 
 - Get her out. 
 - I need you to step outside. 
 - I need you to mind your own business. 
 - Mrs. Perault. 
 - Told you not to tell. She's psycho. 
 - She's not leaving here pregnant! 
 Yes, I am. I'm having this baby. 
 And I'm gonna be a much better 
 mother than you, you bitch. 
 You doing your homework? 
 - No, that lady brought it in. 
 - What lady? 
 The really cute one with the curly hair. 
 She works in Pediatrics. 
 - Oh, yeah. Rena. 
 - Yeah. 
 Hey, we found out exactly 
 what caused your asthma. 
 - You tell them I told you? 
 - Didn't have to. They told us. 
 - They told you, or you asked? 
 - Either way, it's not a problem. 
 They think I squealed. 
 Bo is gonna kick the crap out of me! 
 Don't worry about Bo. 
 Everything is gonna be all right. 
 - No. It won't. They saw me naked! 
 - They just saw you from the waist up. 
 - They're gonna make fun of me forever. 
 - Listen, I knew a boy who... 
 ...was a little husky. 
 He didn't have many friends... 
 ...all the kids used to make fun of him. 
 So he spent most of his time studying. 
 And he went on to college 
 and he became a surgeon. 
 And at his high-school reunion, 
 he took out his scalpel... 
 ...and he cut the tongues off of 
 every kid who ever made fun of him. 
 That supposed to cheer me up, doc? 
 Okay. Help me immobilize 
 the small intestine. 
 Pancreas is fine. 
 - Take a look at this. 
 - It's a hematoma of the duodenum. 
 Yeah. The b*llet went through the 
 medial aspect of the second portion. 
 You're kidding. 
 Have you known me to kid? Okay, 
 open a pancreaticoduodenectomy tray. 
 - He needs a Whipple. 
 - That's a five-hour procedure. 
 I'll call in Peter. 
 - No, no. It's my patient. I'll finish. 
 - No, no, no. No need to t*rture yourself. 
 - I just need a bathroom break. 
 - A bathroom break? 
 Well, I am seven months pregnant. 
 Should have considered that 
 before you started. 
 I'll be back in five minutes. 
 Fine. Shirley, call in another scrub tech. 
 I need an extra pair of hands. 
 - Okay. Forget it. I won't go. 
 - Go. 
 No! I won't! 
 Bovie, pickups. 
 Shirley, can you crawl between 
 my legs and insert a Foley? 
 All right, all right, go on. Go on. Get out. 
 Go on. Get out of here. Go ahead. 
 Don't you need a cable or something? 
 Nope. It just sends it right 
 to your phone. Done. 
 - Okay, okay. Call me. 
 - Okay. 
 - Papa Roach. That is so cool! 
 - Stuart, do one for me. Blink-   . 
 - Looks like he's found some new friends. 
 - How'd you do that? 
 Well, I guess it's a little late for lunch. 
 - Well, we got busy with all these kids. 
 - How about dinner? 
 I'll probably grab a Happy Meal 
 on the way home. 
 Okay, I deserve that. 
 Now you can forgive me. 
 I don't know. 
 Come on. I'm starving. 
 You, me, a couple of big steaks. 
 - I'm a vegetarian. 
 - Or Brussels sprouts. 
 It's a school night. No, seriously. 
 I've got a midterm tomorrow. 
 Well, I can help you study. 
 Might have to pull an all nighter. 
 So is that a yes? 
 Excuse me. 
 So where and when? 
 Let me think about it. I'll call you 
 when I know something more specific. 
 - I thought you were over this age thing. 
 - I am. 
 So, what was that about? 
 - Do you know Abby? 
 - No, but she seems nice. 
 She's nice. Yeah. No, she's just- 
 She's always had this thing for me. 
 You used to go out with her? 
 She's got some issues. She gets 
 weird around other nurses... 
 ...and stuff, so it's probably best 
 not to let her on- 
 Let on about us. 
 I'll meet you down here 
 after your shift. 
 - Yeah. Sounds like a plan. 
 - Okay. 
 When you have a chance, 
 her family wants to talk to you. 
 Peter. 
 Hey. 
 - Mrs. Howard's sodium was    . 
 - What? 
 She was delirious because of 
 profound dehydration. 
 Did you check 
 her mucous membranes? 
 I examined her abdomen 
 for post-op complications. 
 - That's it? 
 - Well, didn't you examine her? 
 I shotgunned her labs 
 and gave her to you. 
 Come here. 
 This whole thing was preventable. 
 If I had recognized the problem 
 and started an IV... 
 ...hell, given her a glass of water, 
 she might still be alive. 
 You don't know. Takes time to 
 make a diagnosis when we're busy. 
 - She wouldn't have grabbed the g*n. 
 - No reason for them to sh**t her. 
 You'll see a tube in her mouth 
 hooked up to a ventilator. 
 Well, she's not breathing? 
 The stroke affected the part of her brain 
 that controls breathing. 
 Will that get better? 
 We'll have to wait and see. Here. 
 You can sit down. 
 Laura? It's Greg. 
 I'm right here. 
 God, she's only   . 
 How could she have a stroke? 
 We think the fertility dr*gs 
 caused the blood clot. 
 Fertility dr*gs? 
 The injections. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I talked to her gynecologist. 
 Your wife was trying 
 to be an egg donor. 
 She was selling her eggs? 
 There was an infertile couple 
 willing to pay $  ,   . 
 We have this little hardware store. 
 Bills are stacking up. 
 Business is down... 
 We're about to file for bankruptcy. 
 I guess she was trying to help. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You didn't have to do this, honey. 
 You didn't have to do this. 
 - Is Dr. Carter around? 
 - He was here a minute ago. 
 Will you tell him I'll be late? 
 There's a new admission to the PICU. 
 No problem. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 - I'm Rena. 
 - Abby. 
 - You're Dr. Carter's friend? 
 - That's right. 
 I hope you don't mind me 
 spending time with John. 
 Why would I? 
 - Well, he told me. 
 - Told you what? 
 About you and him. 
 Me and him? 
 I don't want there 
 to be any hard feelings. 
 I understand how some relationships 
 take longer to get over than others. 
 He told you we had a relationship? 
 I find his honesty refreshing. 
 He's different than most guys. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 He's special. 
 Good view of the heartbeat. 
 There's the head. 
 ""Explore new places. Even though 
 Taureans cringe at the thought... 
 ...of change, trust what lies ahead as a 
 once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "" 
 - That's so perfect. 
 - What? 
 My horoscope. What's your sign? 
 - I don't know. 
 - Well, when's your birthday? 
 Looks like you're about 
 weeks along. 
 - So when will I have it? 
 - November. 
 Early Christmas present. 
 Look, how cute. 
 Babies are a lot of responsibility. 
 I know. 
 It's hard work getting up 
 in the middle of the night. 
 It's easy if you love them. 
 How old was your mom 
 when you were born? 
 Sixteen. 
 Maybe if she had waited a couple years 
 she would have been a better mother. 
 I'm way more mature 
 than she was at   . 
 I'm gonna have a social worker 
 stop by to see you. 
 - Good. I need to sign up. 
 - For what? 
 Money. When my friend Gina 
 had her baby... 
 ...she started getting a check 
 every month. 
 - Your wife wanted... 
 - Randi, any word from the O.R.? 
 - They're still working. 
 - No, no! I said no! 
 - We won't harm her in any way. 
 - Stay the hell away from my wife! 
 Dr. Alexander, Mark Greene. 
 Could you keep her 
 out of here, please? 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Discussing his wife's condition. 
 Right now you're a consultant. 
 Talk to me first. 
 I couldn't find you. I was reviewing 
 her records when he walked in. 
 You were twisting his arm because 
 you want to harvest the eggs. 
 - I was presenting it as an option. 
 - He'll never let you do it. 
 She's already given her consent. 
 He just lost his wife. Leave him alone. 
 She's gonna need 
 a lengthy hospitalization. 
 And then round-the-clock home care. 
 That's a tremendous financial burden. 
 Thanks to your fertility dr*gs. 
 I don't think so. I've been doing 
 IVF for    years... 
 ...and I've never seen this happen. 
 She must have a protein S 
 or an anti-thrombin deficiency. 
 Those are pretty rare conditions. 
 Not as rare as a vascular occlusion 
 from FSH. 
 I'll send up the labs. 
 There's an hour left to retrieve 
 the eggs. It's a   -minute procedure... 
 ...but it'll give them 
 a nice financial cushion. 
 Why don't you try and calm 
 him down, discuss the situation. 
 Another Vicryl. 
 - Why don't you go take a nap? 
 - Because I've got my second wind. 
 - Well, it's about time. 
 - I'm happy to close. 
 Be my guest. 
 Skin stapler. 
 Dr. Greene called again. He'd like you 
 to phone him when the case is over. 
 How sweet. You are one lucky lady. 
 Couple of ABDs. 
 You gonna write post-op orders? 
 - Yes. Leave the clipboard for me. 
 - Okay. Here we go. One, two, three. 
 ABG in    minutes. 
 I'll meet you in Recovery. 
 His brother's in the Waiting Room. 
 Can you talk to him? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey, Abby. Can you update 
 the tetanus on my foot lac? 
 Sure, why not? 
 - You okay? 
 - Oh, yeah. I'm peachy. 
 What's wrong? 
 I don't know, maybe I'm still 
 getting over our breakup. 
 - You talked to Rena. 
 - Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. I panicked. I- 
 What did you say to her? 
 - Nothing. 
 - No, really. 
 Really. Against my better judgment 
 and everything I hold sacred in life... 
 ...I covered for you. So you owe me. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Sure. 
 Also, I told her I dumped you. 
 You dumped me? She believe you? 
 Of course she did. Why wouldn't she? 
 Well, it's just... 
 You'd never dump me. 
 - I would dump you like a bad habit. 
 - Oh, no. 
 - I definitely think I'd dump you first. 
 - In your dreams, maybe. 
 - I would dump you. 
 - No, you wouldn't. 
 You're acting crazy now. 
 - What's that? 
 - Pulse ox came off. 
 That's it for the right side. 
 She in any pain? 
 No. 
 Left ovary looks good. 
 She wrote children's books. 
 Did you know that? 
 Those were our bedtime stories. 
 I still can't believe this is happening. 
 She's had dementia for such a long time. 
 I know. 
 Usually she's forgetful or thinks 
 she's still living at home. 
 But she's never been 
 agitated or violent. 
 I can't imagine her fighting 
 with the police. 
 So you're sure it's nothing 
 from the surgery? 
 No, no. 
 Dementia is a progressive illness. 
 Over time there's worsening 
 psychiatric symptoms. 
 You know, it's been so hard 
 to watch her deteriorate. 
 Even little things can lead to agitation. 
 Sleep deprivation, a bladder infection. 
 - Actually, we think it was dehydration. 
 - From not drinking enough? 
 There's too many people 
 at that nursing home. 
 They weren't even giving her water. 
 - I never should have moved her out. 
 - It was too much for you. 
 I could have done it. 
 I could have cared for her. 
 - I was the one who put her in there. 
 - This is not your fault. 
 Thank you, Dr. Benton. 
 I know she appreciated your kindness. 
 I was looking everywhere for you. 
 Is that Dermabond? 
 How's he gonna get it off? 
 Maybe he'll find some acetone. 
 Carter, could you pitch in 
 with some chart reviews? 
 - It's okay. 
 - I promised Rena I'd help her study. 
 - Tutoring? 
 - Yeah. It's a midterm, right? 
 - Family Studies. 
 - Psychology. 
 Good night, Dr. Carter. 
 - Randi, could you call up to the O.R.? 
 - Again? 
 - Yes. 
 - Don't bother. 
 - I thought you'd never get out. 
 - Neither did I. 
 How are you? 
 If I don't get off my feet, 
 my ankles are going to explode. 
 Did your patient make it? 
 - Yeah. How was your day? 
 - The usual. 
 - You save any lives? 
 - I hope so. 
 - Thank you. That's wonderful. 
 - Dr. Corday, your dinner has arrived. 
 ""Nice work, Mom. "" It's from Robert. 
 Maybe we should 
 have someone taste it first. 
 - I'm so hungry. 
 - Pepperoni pizza. 
 - And ice cream. 
 - Cherry Garcia. 
 Let's go with the ice cream first. 
 I had the most difficult case today, 
 and I got through it. 
 That's good. Have some. 
 Now that it's over, I'm thinking... 
 ...why do I have to prove that a 
 pregnant surgeon can be competent? 
 I don't know. 
 I can operate until the day I deliver. 
 But what the hell for? 
 So, as of now, 
 I'm officially on maternity leave. 
 I'm going to rest... 
 ...I'm gonna take care of myself 
 and my baby. 
 No napkins. 
 Mark, can I just sleep here? I don't 
 think I have the strength to move. 
 I don't think I have the strength 
 to carry you.

er_7_21,108757,7,21,"You should know you're being 
 considered for chief resident next year. 
 I'm pregnant. 
 - Roger's out of town. 
 - Yeah, is he ever around? 
 We haven't been getting along 
 too well lately. 
 - What do you want, Kerry? 
 - I thought you might be hungry. 
 No. No, I'm not, and I have 
 a ton of work to do. So... 
 Your mother was just transported 
 to her commitment hearing. 
 Aren't you supposed to testify? 
 Mrs. Wyczenski is released 
 on her own recognizance. 
 - She needs hospitalization! 
 - I'm not debating it with you, Miss. 
 Why do you think I'm here? 
 Because you know she needs your help, 
 even if she doesn't want it. 
 I just hope you didn't order 
 from that Thai place again. 
 Very good. My turn now? My turn? 
 Did he finish his breakfast? 
 No, but I got him 
 to eat some strawberries. 
 Cleo, he's supposed to have hot cereal 
 before he gets treats. 
 These are just as nutritious, 
 if not more so. And they' re yummy too. 
 Tell the babysitter to make sure 
 he has a good lunch. 
 - I cancelled the sitter. 
 - What? 
 I'm off today. 
 Cleo, Reece needs a lot of attention. 
 Peter, I'm a pediatrician. 
 All right. 
 Hey, see you, man. 
 Say, ""See you at the game, Daddy. "" 
 What? I didn't say 
 I was gonna play tonight. 
 You're not. You're going 
 to sit in the bleachers with Reece. 
 Come on. It'll be fun. 
 I'm playing first base. 
 - He doesn't have a jacket here. 
 - I'll go to Carla's and pick one up. 
 - No. You know what? I'll do it. 
 - I can go. 
 I said I'd go. 
 - I'm on the cell. 
 - Okay. 
 Want to play trains? 
 God, I slept so great. And the dreams. 
 It's so wonderful to be able 
 to dream again. 
 Obviously, the therapy sessions 
 are helping, and these walks. 
 Good. 
 You know what? You don't 
 have to stay home all the time. 
 - I'm sure Luka would love to see you. 
 - It's only been a couple of weeks. 
 - He's a good man. 
 - Yeah. 
 - So is your friend John. 
 - Yeah. 
 Must be fun to have two men 
 interested in you. 
 - Mom! 
 - I've had men interested in me... 
 ...all my life, you know. 
 Just not good ones. 
 Actually, I think your father 
 was the best compared to all the rest. 
 - But I certainly blew that. 
 - Think we should head home? 
 - Why is it we can't talk? 
 - We're talking. 
 No. I mean about important things. 
 You know, Dr. Legaspi says 
 it might be easier... 
 ...for us to do it 
 in a therapy session. 
 - Do what? 
 - Talk. 
 She wants you to come 
 to one of the sessions. 
 - I don't think so. 
 - I want you to come too. 
 - You could come during lunch break. 
 - I'm gonna head back. 
 - Abby, will you come? 
 - I'm gonna go to work. 
 Come on. Just think about it. 
 All right? 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Can I help you? 
 I was just dropping something off. 
 For Kim? She's in the shower. 
 I can give her that if you want. 
 No, thanks. I'll pass it on later. 
 - You're welcome to come in and wait. 
 - No. That won't be necessary. Thanks. 
 Give me your name. 
 I can tell her you stopped by. 
 E.R. 
 Dr. Greene? Yeah, sorry. 
 I need to get some lab slips. 
 Oh, sure. Sorry. 
 - Baby keeping you up, huh? 
 - Not really. 
 She slept for six hours last night, 
 ten minutes at a time. 
 I've been in the hall for five minutes. 
 - I can't find a doc to save my life. 
 - What do you got? 
 Seven-year-old boy tried to put out a fire 
 in a can. Thickness burns on both hands. 
 - Need some help? 
 - Sure. 
 - BP,    /  . 
 - Get it out! 
 - Is that him? He sounds agitated. 
 - You could say that. 
 I'm Dr. Mark Greene. 
 You want to tell me your name? 
 - No! 
 - It's Ben. 
 - I want this out of my nose! 
 - That's to help you breathe. 
 - It's only for a little while. 
 - You his mother? 
 - Neighbor. He's a friend of my son's. 
 - No answer at the kid's house. 
 - Good air entry. Both lungs are clear. 
 - Any way to contact the parents? 
 - He just has a father. I left a message. 
 - I want to go home! 
 - Let's go. 
 - Get it out! 
 What do you see me in? 
 A Beemer or a Porsche? 
 - Most of the time I see you walking. 
 - Okay. You can forget about a ride. 
 Carter, buy or lease? 
 - Dr. Dave behind the wheel, huh? 
 - This is topaz-blue metallic. 
 - What do you think? 
 - I think it's out of your price range. 
 I'm moonlighting 
 at a doc in the box, my friend. 
 - Three months, I got my down payment. 
 - Then what happens? 
 Fake my own death. 
 You playing ball tonight? 
 We'll kick Sanitation's ass. 
 - Maybe. 
 - Neck pain in Curtain   is asking for you. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Black or sand interior? 
 I hope you're not keeping patients 
 waiting while you shop for a car. 
 No, no, no. 
 I'm all over that board, chief. 
 Don't worry. He still has 
 to pass his driver's test. 
 - Dr. Carter, can I speak to you a minute? 
 - Sure. 
 - Morning. 
 - Morning, Dr. Chen. 
 - Hey. 
 - Deb. 
 - Could you excuse us a minute? 
 - Sure. 
 Your application was intercepted 
 by administration. 
 Processing time has improved. 
 You realize you're still 
 in a probationary period? 
 Which will be completed by the time the 
 chief resident's slot needs to be filled. 
 Why do you want to do this? 
 It gets me closer to a junior faculty 
 position. Looks good on the CV. 
 No. I mean why risk 
 compromising your recovery... 
 ...by taking on a new 
 and very demanding position? 
 I guess I don't see it as a risk. 
 Having teaching 
 and administrative responsibilities... 
 - ... along with your clinical shifts? 
 - I'm in the program. 
 I've been managing my stress. 
 I got myself back up to speed. 
 Carter, you'd all but give up 
 nights and weekends. 
 - It's a tremendous amount of work. 
 - I'm ready for it. 
 We can't just gloss over 
 what happened last year. 
 - Neither can the committee. 
 - You're returning my application? 
 Did you honestly think 
 that you'd make the first cut? 
 - Get your hands off me! 
 - He's all yours. 
 - Here. Let me take a closer look. 
 - Don't touch me! 
 - It'll feel better in a second. I promise. 
 - Mild erythema, no blistering. 
 - It hurts! Stop! 
 - Let the doctor finish. Okay? 
 - You want to tell me what happened? 
 - No! 
 - I think he lit the fire himself. 
 - Shut up! 
 - Why don't we get a burn tray for Ben? 
 - Sure. 
 - He's home by himself a lot. 
 - I said shut up! 
 I just wish he would stop 
 hanging around my son. 
 Hey. Good news. Our second baseman 
 has the stomach flu. 
 - Luka, I'm not playing softball. 
 - Well, you don't have to be great. 
 - It's just for fun. 
 - Actually, I happen to play very well. 
 - So go. It'll be good for you. 
 - I can't. 
 One night away from your mother 
 isn't gonna do anything. 
 I miss you. 
 Have a good time tonight. 
 Conni, can you dispense some 
 ketoconazole to Exam  ? 
 - Sure. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Emergency ringworm, huh? 
 - Pretty hard to avoid. 
 - The guy has    cats. 
 - You might want to give him a flea bath. 
 So, what was going on 
 between you and Weaver? 
 Not much. 
 Except for her denying my application 
 for chief resident. 
 Apparently, I still have 
 a scarlet A on my chest. 
 Wow. I'm really sorry, John. 
 - Don't be. It makes you a shoo-in. 
 - There are other candidates. 
 Not really. I guess 
 congratulations are in order. 
 - Congratulations. You deserve it. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Not as much as me, but... 
 - Yeah, right. 
 - Hey. 
 - It's on the chair. 
 - I put a cap in there too. 
 - Good. 
 Just stay a while, 
 and have some coffee, maybe. 
 You know what? I need to get back. 
 - You all right? 
 - Yeah. 
 Roger moved out a few days ago. 
 I'll be okay. 
 Are you sure? 
 It would have saved us both a lot of 
 trouble if we had just stayed together. 
 You know, Peter? 
 Would have been better 
 for Reece, anyway. 
 He said he never loved me. 
 Carla, people say a lot of things 
 they don't mean when they're fighting. 
 I don't know. I think it's true. 
 Maybe we never had anything. 
 It will work itself out. 
 You and I... 
 ...we had something. 
 Didn't we, Peter? 
 - Sometimes I think we still do. 
 - I'm not doing this, Carla. 
 Peter, don't go. 
 - Yeah? 
 - That's a nice hello. 
 Cleo. 
 - Did you make it to Carla's yet? 
 - A few minutes ago. 
 Hey, how about picking up deli 
 on the way home? 
 - We can have a picnic on the field. 
 - Sure. Yeah. Whatever. 
 - You all right? 
 - Yeah, why? 
 I don't know. You sound funny. 
 - Is she giving you a hard time again? 
 - Who? 
 - Carla. 
 - You know, I'm sorry. I'm just in a rush. 
 - Reece, wait! 
 - What's he doing? 
 Hang on, Peter. Oh, my God! 
 - Cleo, what happened? 
 - Is there something wrong? 
 Read it and weep. 
 No bleeding, no hydrocephalus, 
 no midline shift... 
 ...no subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 Okay. Do an LP. 
 You got a chronic neck pain patient. 
 Wait. You want me to give 
 a Demerol junkie a spinal tap? 
 CTs are only    percent 
 sensitive, Dave. 
 What are you two? A tag team? 
 I know what I'm doing. 
 - Oh, to be a junior resident again. 
 - Not. 
 - Dr. Chen, can I see you? 
 - Sure. 
 - Good luck. 
 - Thanks. 
 Chief residency 
 is typically an extra year... 
 ...completing the emergency 
 medicine program. 
 In rare cases, we make an exception 
 and allow a senior to be in the position. 
 - Right. 
 - Unfortunately, your maternity leave... 
 ...put you three months behind 
 on shifts and procedures... 
 ...keeping you just shy 
 of senior status. 
 But I'm in the process 
 of making that up. 
 Yes, but the academic year 
 ends June   . 
 And I'm planning on working every 
 weekend and every holiday until then. 
 Hospital policy actively discourages 
 work weeks in excess of    hours. 
 And given that limitation, 
 it doesn't seem feasible... 
 ...that you'd succeed 
 in making the deadline. 
 And as a result, I'm afraid you won't be 
 a candidate for chief resident this year. 
 I'm sorry. I know it doesn't seem fair. 
 Wait. This is completely sexist 
 and discriminatory! 
 - Excuse me? 
 - You all but offered me this position... 
 - ... prior to my pregnancy. 
 - Yes. And at that time... 
 ...I anticipated your completion 
 of the program. 
 I had a baby. I think I made a choice 
 that was both legal and responsible. 
 Of course you did. 
 I made a sacrifice, largely 
 for the sake of my career... 
 ...and becoming chief resident 
 is a huge part of that. 
 - Jing-Mei. 
 - I'm a good doctor. 
 I've offered to make up for lost time. 
 And I didn't screw up. 
 Under the circumstances, 
 I think I deserve a chance. 
 I appreciate your thoughts. 
 And I'll take them under advisement. 
 I'd hope you would. 
 - What is that stuff? 
 - Thermazine cream. 
 Make you feel better, and it helps 
 keep it from getting infected. 
 - My fingers feel funny. 
 - How? 
 - I can't feel the ends. 
 - No? 
 - Maybe with this hand. 
 - Hey! 
 - You know, that's not funny. 
 - Everything okay in here? 
 Yeah. Little Ben here 
 just tried to grab me. 
 - She was hurting my hand. 
 - Oh, yeah? Let me take a look. 
 He says he can't feel his fingers. 
 Here, let me see your hand. 
 What's wrong? 
 It hurts there, huh? Did you fall? 
 I don't know. Maybe. 
 Let's get an x-ray 
 of this left hand just in case. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 - Hey, hey, hey. 
 - Settle down. 
 - My head. 
 - Yeah. 
 Okay, let me take a look at your head. 
 Okay. Do you remember 
 when you hurt your ear? 
 - Huh? 
 - You got a pretty bad bruise back here. 
 Six-disk CD changer, tinted windows. 
 That's- Hello? 
 - There's an ACL tear in Exam  . 
 - Yeah. I was on my way, chief. 
 Yeah? Dr. Malucci, you're a resident. 
 You can't afford a car! 
 What was all that about? 
 Misguided sense of job security. 
 Lot of that going around. 
 I heard you came by the house. 
 Yeah, I was in the area, 
 and on a whim, I thought I'd stop by. 
 Lori said that you had a letter, 
 but that you didn't leave it. 
 It just didn't seem like 
 the timing was very good. 
 I can see how 
 you would feel that way. 
 How long have you two 
 been seeing each other? 
 Not long. 
 I'm sorry. I know this 
 must be painful for you. 
 - No, I'm fine. I mean, it's fine. 
 - Okay. 
 Kerry? 
 - You take care of yourself. 
 - You too. 
 I've got an AMA form 
 I need you to cosign. 
 - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. 
 - You didn't. 
 You two okay? 
 - Dr. Legaspi. 
 - Hi. 
 Hi. I was wondering if you could tell me 
 how it's going with my mother. 
 I'm sorry, Abby. I really can't discuss 
 her therapy with you. 
 Even if she said you said I should 
 attend one of her sessions? 
 I think that it would be 
 mutually beneficial. Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Could you give me a little bit 
 of an idea what to expect? 
 Well, it's not an ambush. 
 I'm sorry. It's just that she lies a lot. 
 We meet at  . 
 You don't have to come 
 if you don't want to. 
 Still hurt? I'm sorry. 
 Oh, baby! Look at you. 
 - It's all right. Your mommy's here. 
 - How bad is it? 
 He's got a fracture 
 of the fifth metacarpal. 
 - His hand is broken? 
 - He's gonna have to wear a cast. 
 - How is he gonna sign? 
 - He's not. 
 All right. It's okay. Mommy's here. 
 I'm sorry. I just looked away 
 for a second, and he was at the piano. 
 Listen, why don't you give us 
 a few minutes, okay? 
 Of course. 
 - Hey. This is your fault, you know. 
 - I am so sorry. 
 - Reece is not like other children. 
 - I know. 
 Then how come you didn't stay 
 in his eye line? 
 It was an accident, Carla. 
 I don't know what else to say. 
 I feel horrible about this. 
 - I want you to stay away from my son. 
 - Carla, can we just-? 
 What would have happened 
 if you turned away again? 
 What would have happened if Reece 
 had run out into the street? He is deaf! 
 You cannot just call him! 
 You have to be with-! 
 - All right, Carla. 
 - I don't want to see this bitch... 
 - I said back off! 
 - ... anywhere near Reece again! 
 Go. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hi. 
 Hit and run. ETA's five minutes. 
 Kind of like waiting for thunder 
 after the lightning strikes. 
 Dr. Legaspi and I... 
 It ended. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Something changed? 
 Yes. 
 Do you love her? 
 Then you should go forward, not back. 
 Fifty-year-old male changing 
 a blowout got sideswiped by a car. 
 LOC at the scene, but started 
 coming around in the rig. 
 - Obvious femur fracture. Vitals? 
 - Initially,    palp. 
 BP's up to    / 
 after      cc's of saline. 
 - Sir, can you tell us your name? 
 - Jim Vogel. God! My legs! 
 - Trauma  . Go. 
 - Serial crits, type and cross times  . 
 We got one more, doc. 
 She won't come out. 
 Restrained, but got a forehead lac 
 from the mirror. 
 Brother says she's 
 developmentally challenged. 
 - What's her name? 
 - Won't say. 
 I'm not sure she understands 
 the question. 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver. 
 Can you tell me who you are? 
 - Jim's sister. 
 - Okay. 
 We need to make sure you're not 
 seriously hurt. Can you come out? 
 - I want to go again. 
 - I'm sorry? 
 - On a ride. It's fun. 
 - She's been smiling like this... 
 ...ever since I got her in the rig. 
 Here we go. 
 Crepitations on the right, with decreased 
 air entry. I need that chest tube. 
 - Tachy at    . I'll set it up. 
 - God, I can't stand it. 
 - What do you got so far? 
 - Pneumo on the right, unstable pelvis... 
 - ... fractured right hip. 
 - Where's Bonnie? 
 - Is that your sister's name? 
 - Yeah. 
 Another doctor's checking. She appears 
 to have only minor injuries. 
 Does Bonnie have any medical conditions 
 other than her developmental delay? 
 - No. She's always been healthy. 
 - Okay. 
 - Sorry I'm late. 
 - It's fine. We're glad you could join us. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Please know that we both understand 
 how awkward it can be... 
 - ... to step into someone else's therapy. 
 - It's okay. I'm fine. 
 - Maggie, do you want to continue? 
 - Sure. 
 So Dr. Legaspi and I 
 were talking about... 
 We talked about a lot. But we were 
 talking about ways I could stay healthy. 
 You know, how to position myself 
 to get it together, keep on track. And... 
 ...part of that is that 
 I've decided to go home. 
 - Have you talked to Eric? 
 - No, not Florida. 
 ""Home"" home. 
 I'm going back to Minnesota. 
 You haven't been to Minneapolis 
 in    years, Mom. 
 I know that. I know. I haven't. 
 But I grew up there. 
 And I feel like I belong there. I've got 
 a little bit of family and some friends. 
 - What friends? 
 - Gina. 
 You remember Gina? 
 Well, I'm gonna stay with her. 
 She has a spare room. 
 She thinks she could get me a job in the 
 convalescent hospital where she works. 
 Really? When did you arrange all this? 
 Last week. I... She accepted 
 a collect phone call from me. 
 She was glad to hear from me, Abby. 
 She was glad to talk to me. 
 Anyway, I'll save enough money, 
 and I'll get a place of my own. 
 - A place of your own? 
 - Yes. A place of my own... 
 ...with no roommates, no men. 
 Just me. Maybe a cat. 
 - A cat? That would be a great pet. Cat. 
 - Are you reacting to your mother's plans? 
 I'm not reacting. 
 I'm just... 
 - Just what? 
 - Nothing. 
 Abby, I can't stay here in Chicago. 
 I don't want to go to Florida. 
 It's just too easy for me 
 to be a drain on you and- 
 You know, I think we're 
 way past that at this point. 
 What is your objection 
 to your mother going home? 
 Nothing. 
 It's very romantic. 
 You're not happy about it? 
 I don't know what you want me to say. 
 Yippee, she's going home? 
 Fabulous, that solves 
 all the problems? What? 
 - Then what is your solution? 
 - I don't have a solution. 
 I don't... I don't think 
 there is a solution. 
 To talk about this as if it were some 
 life-management problem... 
 ...that you can plan 
 your way out of, well, it's absurd. 
 - Then what do you suggest? 
 - I don't know. 
 You know what? I don't know. 
 I don't know. 
 So I guess you're right. You have 
 to do something, Mom. Good luck. 
 - So, what? You're leaving? 
 - You wanted to tell me. You told me. 
 - Well, I'm not going for a week or so. 
 - Okay, great. See you later. 
 - When did Ben Fossen's father arrive? 
 - While ago. 
 Someone should have told me. 
 - Hi. I'm Dr. Greene. 
 - Derek Fossen. 
 - Thanks for taking care of him. 
 - Sure. Can we talk outside? 
 Yeah. We'll be right outside, Ben. 
 Mrs. Shayatovich told me 
 about the fire. 
 - Your neighbor? 
 - Yeah. He's always getting into trouble. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Yeah. His mom's out of the picture. 
 - And I think it makes him act out. 
 - Well, those burns will heal. 
 Good. Thanks. 
 I'm just waiting on the psychiatrist 
 to come talk to Ben. 
 Psychiatrist? Why? 
 We found some unusual bruising 
 on your son, Mr. Fossen. 
 Do you know about that? 
 - No. 
 - You've never noticed the bruises? 
 - Well, he gets into scrapes at school. 
 - Fights? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Any serious injuries? 
 No more than any kid. 
 - I'm sure he'll tell that to the doctor. 
 - Look, he doesn't need a psychiatrist. 
 - And I have to get back to work. So... 
 - I know. I know. This won't take long. 
 We're supposed to be at the park. 
 Is that where you were driving? 
 Two to  :   we go to the park. 
 But we had a crash. 
 - I know. 
 - My parents had a crash. 
 - When's Jimmy coming back? 
 - I don't know. 
 Did they die in the crash? 
 Your parents? 
 So, what do you do 
 in the park, Bonnie? 
 The slide. 
 Anything else? 
 The swing. You know, 
 Jimmy pushes me. 
 Not too high, though. 
 Do you have 
 any other brothers or sisters? 
 Nope. 
 - C-spine is clear. 
 - No perihepatic fluid... 
 - ... but I can't see the spleen. 
 - Where's Bonnie? 
 - She's fine. She's getting some sutures. 
 - Thank God. 
 Minimal blood in the Thora-Seal, 
 but his repeat crit is   . 
 - He's bleeding from somewhere. 
 - Probably here. 
 - What's wrong? 
 - You shattered your pelvis. 
 - That'll heal though, right? 
 - Yes. 
 But the bone may be cutting 
 an artery. We need a CAT scan... 
 ...to see where the bleeding 
 is coming from. 
 Lydia, call Radiology. Tell them we need 
 abdomen and pelvis with contrast. 
 - Will I need surgery? 
 - We'll know after the scan. 
 - I can't be laid up. My sister... 
 - Yes, I know. 
 We'll try to stop the bleeding by injecting 
 a clotting agent into the artery. 
 - BP's down to   /  . 
 - Okay. Hang another two units. 
 - And call for six type-specific. 
 - Okay. We need to go now. 
 I'm gonna bring Carla home, and then 
 go by your place and pick up his stuff. 
 Fine. 
 Listen, I told you. Reece, 
 he needs special attention. 
 - Peter, I know that. I made a mistake. 
 - All right. 
 You know, but you're acting 
 like I deliberately let him get hurt. 
 I'm sorry about what happened. 
 Carla gets upset. 
 Well, I don't get called 
 a bitch by anyone. 
 Bonnie, where are you 
 supposed to be? 
 - Finding my brother. 
 - Okay. 
 - Jing-Mei? 
 - You're supposed to stay in that room. 
 I have to tell my brother 
 what I want for dinner. 
 - Why is he back? 
 - He dropped his pressure upstairs. 
 - There he is. Jimmy! 
 - BP's only    palp. 
 Hang another two units on the infuser. 
 What did the scan show? 
 He crashed before we even 
 got him on the table. 
 - Dr. Weaver? 
 - Open a peritoneal lavage kit. 
 We'll go supra-umbilical. 
 Lydia, drop an NG. 
 - My sister has special needs. 
 - Let's worry about you right now. 
 - HemoCue is ten. 
 - Okay, we need central access. 
 - Somebody get Dr. Chen! 
 - There's no one else but me. 
 Okay, Jim. 
 Dr. Chen, put in subclavian. 
 - Got it. 
 - Pressure's down to   . 
 - Pulse ox dropped to   . 
 - Jim? Jim? 
 He's not breathing. 
 Give me a  -  tube. 
 - Bag him on     percent. 
 - Get in that line! 
 Luka, if the tap is positive, 
 he goes to the O.R. 
 If not, maybe we can embolize 
 the pelvic bleeders. 
 - I'm in. 
 - Squeeze all the blood you can. 
 Call for eight more units. 
 - Well, the hand's okay. 
 - Look at the wrist. 
 - Is that a Colles' fracture? 
 - Ben says he never hurt his wrist. 
 - Maybe he's too young to remember it. 
 - His dad doesn't remember, either. 
 - How did your talk go with him? 
 - Well, he's a pretty hostile kid. 
 - Clammed up when Dad showed up. 
 - Yeah. It was hard to talk to him. 
 His dad was standing outside 
 the whole time, and Ben knew it. 
 - He's terrified of him. 
 - I think he is. 
 But he says there's no v*olence 
 in the home. 
 You saw that bruising. 
 That's him getting pulled by his ear. 
 He says he doesn't remember 
 how it happened. 
 You don't forget a broken bone 
 or bruising like that. 
 - Lost his pulse. 
 - He'll never make it to Angio. 
 Pump in that blood. 
 Order two units of FFP. He's in V-fib! 
 - Starting compressions. 
 - Okay, charge to    . Clear. 
 - V-fib. 
 - Thoracotomy tray. 
 - It's blunt trauma. 
 - It's an isolated pelvic injury. Clear. 
 - Lydia, close the blinds to Suture. 
 - Still in fib. 
 Three-sixty. Clear. 
 I'm starving. 
 We could pick something up 
 from Doc Magoo's. 
 If I were smart, I would 
 have gone to lunch... 
 ...instead of getting reamed 
 by my mother and Legaspi. 
 I don't get it. A week ago 
 she wanted her committed. 
 - And now she's completely on her side. 
 - It's not about sides. 
 Well, it felt like it was. 
 All of a sudden it was all about me. 
 What was my problem that I couldn't get 
 onboard with this plan she figured out? 
 - Would any plan have made you happy? 
 - No. 
 When was the last time 
 your mom was in therapy? 
 - I don't know. Like ten years ago. 
 - That's different. 
 - Yeah. 
 - So you got a choice. 
 You can either hope 
 that she makes it this time... 
 - ... or give up. 
 - Right. 
 - Doesn't seem like you want to do that. 
 - I don't know what I want to do. 
 - Weaver dropped a b*mb this morning. 
 - What happened? 
 - She bagged me for chief resident. 
 - Really? 
 Apparently my rehab 
 has caught up to me. 
 - Oh, no. I'm sorry. 
 - It's not your fault. 
 Not exactly. 
 I guess part of facing the problem is 
 accepting some people won't get over it. 
 - I'm sorry, John. 
 - Me too. 
 For you. 
 Get a   -pack of platelets. 
 - Heart's not filling. 
 - Units   and    are in. 
 - Hold compressions. 
 - Still in fib. 
 - Vasopressin? 
 - Onboard. 
 Another     of lido. 
 I'll take the internal paddles. 
 - How long has he been down? 
 -   minutes. 
 - Charge to   . 
 - Jimmy? 
 - Bonnie, you have to go outside. 
 - Clear. 
 - I don't like that. 
 - Charge again. 
 - Lydia? 
 - I don't want you to do that. 
 - We're trying to help him. 
 - But it hurts him. 
 - Clear. 
 - It hurts him. 
 Charge again. 
 Clear! 
 Heart's empty. Asystole. 
 Should we try pacing him? 
 Okay. That's it. 
 Time of death   :   . 
 - Can you close the chest up? 
 - Yeah. 
 Clean him up but leave the tubes 
 in for the coroner. 
 I'll tell the sister. 
 - Want me to come with you? 
 - Yeah. 
 I'm tired of it here. I think 
 Jimmy and me should go home. 
 The doctors are going 
 to talk to you now. 
 - Hi, Bonnie. 
 - Hi. 
 Bonnie, this is your brother's doctor. 
 Is he ready to go? 
 Bonnie, Jim was very hurt. 
 And he couldn't recover 
 from his injuries. 
 - Cover? 
 - Get better. 
 Your brother died, Bonnie. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Do you understand? 
 Like Ernie. He died. 
 - Who's Ernie? 
 - My hamster. 
 We put him in a box. 
 Okay. 
 Well, like your hamster, 
 Jim won't be with you anymore. 
 I got a new hamster. 
 His name is Ernie too. 
 You know how 
 your parents went away? 
 In the crash? 
 Jimmy went away like that too. 
 - But it's library night. 
 - I know. 
 And I get scared at night. 
 Bonnie, you're gonna 
 have to be very brave. 
 Where's Jimmy? 
 There you are. 
 - Hi. 
 - Do you have a minute? 
 Sure. Am I in trouble or something? 
 I don't usually do this. 
 But I think it's important. 
 I think you need to give your mom 
 one more chance. 
 - Didn't I do that today? 
 - You started to. And then you ran away. 
 Maybe because I've heard it 
 about     times before. 
 - I think this time's different. 
 - Do you? Why? 
 Well, she hasn't been willing 
 to go to therapy for    years. 
 - Now she's embracing it. 
 - I'd love to believe that meant something. 
 Don't let your mom go away 
 without being able to talk to you. 
 - That won't make either of you happy. 
 - I don't think ""happy"" is on the table. 
 - Why not? 
 - Look, I'm not in therapy. 
 Fair enough. 
 But I'll consider it. 
 - What you said. 
 - Okay. 
 - She has the mind of a  -year-old. 
 - And no other relatives? 
 Her brother was her only family. 
 I've tried ARC, Protection, 
 and Advocacy. No luck. 
 The facilities are all full. She'll have 
 to take a place at a group home. 
 No. I don't want her sent 
 to a place like that. 
 They've got four or five people 
 in every room. 
 Unless you take her home, 
 this is all I can offer. 
 Okay. But I don't want her 
 sleeping on the couch or on the floor. 
 Well, I'll pass that along. 
 You'll have to get her there. 
 They're too backed up to pick her up. 
 - Oh, come on! 
 - I'm just the messenger. 
 - Look, in time she'll adjust. 
 - Adele, this stinks. 
 They have got job-training programs. 
 Hopefully she'll learn a skill. 
 - Adele, ready? 
 - Yeah. 
 Sorry. 
 It's about time. 
 Ben has not eaten since noon. 
 - We'll get him something. 
 - We'd rather go. 
 This is Adele Neuman. 
 She's a social worker. 
 - Hi. Hi, Ben. 
 - Hi. 
 My kid does not need 
 any more counseling or whatever. 
 I'm afraid Ben's gonna 
 have to stay for a few days. 
 - What? 
 - We're taking him into custody. 
 What are you talking about? 
 I'm not comfortable 
 with the bruising I found. 
 God forbid you're not comfortable. 
 I also found evidence of a broken wrist 
 which neither of you mentioned. 
 I told you that he fights! 
 - Would you tell them? 
 - I fight a lot. 
 If that's true, then you'll get 
 to go home in three days. 
 - But now I need you to come with me. 
 - I don't want to. 
 You're not doing this to us! 
 Security! 
 - Get your hands off of me! 
 - You don't have a choice here. 
 - If you think I hurt my kid, you're crazy. 
 - I suggest you contact a lawyer. 
 - To sue your ass! 
 - It's for your protection. 
 I don't want to! 
 Let me stay with him! 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Leave him alone! 
 - No! Dad! Please! 
 - You bastard! 
 - Please! Dad! 
 - Why are you doing this to us? 
 Dad! 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 Guess what? The super finally fixed 
 the stove fan. So I cooked dinner. 
 Cucumber soup, a little salmon. 
 - Why don't you invite Luka to dinner? 
 - He's playing softball. 
 - That sounds like fun. Are you gonna go? 
 - I don't want to play. 
 The reason why I ran out today 
 like that is because it's just... 
 It's scary to hope too much, 
 you know? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I know I might not make it. 
 But, Abby... 
 ...something happened to me in that 
 ICU room. 
 I realized I don't want to die. 
 And more than that... 
 ...I don't want my little girl to watch me 
 die. I can't do that to you. Not ever. 
 That's what I wanted 
 to tell you today. 
 I'm gonna handle my life. 
 And I want you to get on with yours. 
 Okay. 
 - You can't put your life on hold anymore. 
 - It's not on hold. 
 You won't play softball 
 with your boyfriend. 
 - So? I don't want to play. 
 - Stop sitting things out, Abby. 
 I don't. 
 Yes, you do. 
 You can't use me as the reason 
 for not doing the things you want to do. 
 - Go to medical school. 
 - That's not so easy. 
 - Get married. 
 - I was married! 
 - Get pregnant. 
 - I was pregnant! 
 What happened? 
 What happened? 
 I had an abortion. 
 Some people aren't meant 
 to be mothers. 
 Abby... 
 ...I was a lot younger than you are now 
 when I had my first manic episode. 
 I've watched you since you were 
 a little girl. You're not bipolar. 
 No. But my kids could be. 
 But they might not be. 
 They could be anything. 
 And you will just love them. 
 That's all. 
 You never even told Richard, did you? 
 No, I think that was 
 the beginning of the end for us... 
 ...because we just stopped talking 
 about everything. 
 I just was too scared. 
 I couldn't risk it. 
 I just- I didn't want to... 
 - Turn into me? 
 - Yeah. 
 Or have to end up 
 taking care of another me? 
 Oh, honey. 
 Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. 
 That's all there is is risk. 
 You just have to take a chance 
 and leap into life. 
 Otherwise, sweetheart, you're gonna 
 miss out on all the great things. 
 Abby, you deserve all the great things. 
 Do you hear me? 
 But I like my home. 
 Someone there 
 will take good care of you. 
 This man's gonna drive you, okay? 
 Jimmy was gonna make me hot dogs. 
 Take this woman to this address. 
 Make sure she's met 
 by an adult before you leave. 
 - Yeah, all right. 
 - Will they have hot dogs? 
 I don't know. But I'm sure they'll have 
 something good. Here you go. 
 I had better go to my home. 
 I'm sorry. You can't. 
 But I like my home. 
 I like my bed and my blanket. 
 Bonnie, you can't live alone. 
 But I need my blanket. 
 - Jimmy always gives me my blanket. 
 - Someone there will give you one. 
 And he gives me hot dogs 
 when I want. 
 - I like my home. I don't want a new one. 
 - Bonnie... 
 Zip your jacket, sweetie. 
 It's chilly. 
 Hey, batter, batter. 
 No batter. No batter. 
 Strike one! 
 - That's good, right? 
 - That's good. 
 - Put it right here, doc. 
 - You got it, big guy. 
 - That's strike two. 
 - That's all right. 
 Luka, look alive, man. 
 Hey, batter, batter. 
 No batter. No batter. 
 - You change your mind? 
 - I even brought my own glove. 
 - Hey, Abby. You playing? 
 - Yeah. 
 Pick your w*apon 
 because you're up after Carter. 
 All right. Keep your head 
 in the game. 
 You brought your mom? 
 - Go get them, John. 
 - Thank you, Maggie. 
 All right, Carter. Get in there, man. 
 - Luka, I didn't know you played softball. 
 - I don't. I'm last in the batting order. 
 You should put Abby up. She was 
 an all-star on her Little League team. 
 - How about you? 
 - I'm just gonna watch. 
 All-star? 
 I like you in that hat. 
 - I almost look American, huh? 
 - Almost. 
 Some vocabulary for a  -year-old. 
 Bone survey turned up bilateral 
 healed spiral fractures of the radius. 
 - So you were right. 
 - Pin a rose on me. 
 Kim? 
 Hi, Kerry. 
 - This is for you. 
 - What is it? 
 It's how I feel about things, about you. 
 And I never really told you. 
 And maybe it doesn't matter now. 
 But I wanted you to know. 
 Okay. 
 You broke both your arms, Ben. 
 No, they're fine. 
 These are your x-rays. 
 These lines are fractures. 
 That was a long time ago. 
 I tripped at school. 
 No. You don't get these 
 kinds of breaks from falling. 
 After I tripped, I fell down the stairs. 
 No, Ben. You know 
 what I think happened? 
 I think somebody grabbed your arm 
 with two hands... 
 ...and then twisted it 
 like you do with a wet towel. 
 I'm bad a lot. 
 You are? 
 I make too much noise playing. 
 I leave messes. 
 And Dad punishes you? 
 Well, how does he punish you? 
 Sometimes like you said. 
 He calls them Indian burns. 
 Yeah? 
 It's my fault. He wouldn't do it 
 if I wasn't bad. 
 No, Ben. 
 Nobody should break your arm... 
 ...no matter how bad you are. 
 You understand? 
 I don't care. I just want to go home. 
 You can't go home right now, Ben. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Come on, Malik! 
 Show them where you live! 
 Run, Abby! Run, Abby! 
 Abby, go! Abby! 
 - Way to go! 
 - Brought your cheering section, I see. 
 That's my girl! That's great! 
 Go get them. 
 All right, Luka. Just meet the ball 
 like we talked about, all right? 
 - Hey. 
 - Strike one! 
 You were so great. You were great. 
 Did you hear me cheering? 
 Yes. I think everybody 
 heard you cheering. 
 - Strike two. 
 - Luka, don't crowd the plate! 
 - What? 
 - The plate! Get back! 
 - He's cute but he's no Mickey Mantle. 
 - No. 
 Ball one. 
 - Are you cold? 
 - No, no. I love it. 
 Thank you for bringing me here. 
 - You looked like you were having fun. 
 - I was. 
 That's good. That's really good. 
 Foul ball. 
 That's a foul ball. That's a foul ball! 
 - Where are you going? 
 - I don't think he knows that. 
 Run, Luka! Run!

 GREENE: 
 It's Susan Lewis. 
 We're supposed to have lunch. 
 You didn't say anything 
 about having a lunch. 
 If you want the Chief Residency 
 it's yours. 
 Jackie, it's Peter. 
 If you're there, pick up. 
 Hey, Roger, it's Peter. 
 I need you to pick up Reese 
 from school. 
 I found her. 
 It's your mother. 
 Is that breast milk? 
 You're contaminated. 
 Scrub out, 
 Elizabeth. 
 What do you want me to do, 
 Rachel? 
 You could let me stay here. 
 It's a big move. 
 Do you guys 
 have a satellite dish? 
 Well, you're not 
 winning me over. 
 Signed you up for Tuesday. 
 You serious? 
 Yeah, it's, uh... 
 No, it's my pager number. 
 Yes, Dr. Kerry Weaver. 
 No. It's nothing serious. 
 I just, uh, have some 
 personal information for her. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Oh, good morning. 
 Good morning. 
 You all set? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I forgot how jammed 
 the El can be 
 during rush hour. 
 Is there any chance 
 I could get a locker? 
 Oh, sure. 
 Fourth to the right. 
 I'll have them 
 take the name off. 
 Welcome back. 
 Thanks. 
 MAN: 
 Hey! 
 Watch out, coming through. 
 I heard it, 
 but I didn't believe. 
 Malik. 
 Oh, we missed you. 
 They actually talked you 
 into coming back 
 and working here? 
 Bad idea? 
 I didn't say that. 
 Frank, could you call 
 housekeeping? 
 Someone took a dump 
 in Exam Two. 
 Hey, Frank, our mad 
 crapper's back, huh? 
 If I catch him, he'll 
 be pooping in a bag. 
 What happened to the board? 
 Weaver. 
 Weaver. 
 Hey, Spanky's in 
 Curtain Three 
 complaining of 
 incontinence. 
 I'm not 
 touching him. 
 I'll take him. 
 I don't think you want that 
 on your first day back. 
 Here. Leg injury, 
 Curtain One. 
 Oh. 
 MALIK: 
 Welcome back, Dr. L. 
 Thanks, Malik. 
 So what's the 
 story with Spanky? 
 He likes nurses... 
 a lot. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. 
 Dr. Lewis? 
 Are you Susan Lewis? 
 Yes. 
 Cleo Finch. 
 I'm the Senior

 Nice to meet you. 
 I have a few

 Okay. 
 Curtain Three, worst 
 headache of his life. 
 Do a spinal tap if the 
 head C.T.'s negative. 
 Okay, no problem. 
 Well, well, well, 
 Dr. Susan Lewis. 
 Dr. Benton. 
 Just when I thought it was safe 
 to come to the E.R. 
 I missed you, too, Peter. 
 I know. 
 So, can I buy 
 you breakfast? 
 I just got here, 
 but you can get me lunch. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I have to sign out 
 and get to Schaumburg. 
 Another interview? 
 Nope. The job's all mine. 
 I'm meeting the medical director 
 today. 
 Oh, congratulations. 
 Nosebleed and sutures-- 
 Scott Marisol. 
 Check on him in 20 minutes 
 and wear a mask. He's a spitter. 
 Right? Are you 
 going somewhere? 
 I've been offered 
 the chance 
 to run a pediatric 
 urgent care. 
 Five doctors, 
 eight-hour shifts. 
 No overnights. 
 Yeah, but it's... 
 What? 
 In Schaumburg. 
 It's 40 minutes away. 
 Uh, I.V. drug user with 
 a sh**t's abscess. 
 Whisked off to eco 
 before I could drain him. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah, they just 
 brought in 
 a homeless lady

 Oh. 
 Thanks.

 CORDAY: 
 Mark, can you get the water? 
 Have you seen 
 my vertigo notes? 
 I got it. 
 What? 
 My vertigo notes. 
 They were right here. 
 We need to leave 
 in ten minutes. 
 Oh, I'm ready as soon 
 as I find my notes. 
 Hello. Uh-huh. 
 Oh, hi. 
 When did you last have them? 
 Last night. 
 Yeah. Uh-huh. 
 That'll be fun. 
 Okay, hold on. 
 Uh, Dad, can I go 
 to a party tonight? 
 It's a school night. 
 Something's burning. 
 Just for dinner. 
 It's Claire's birthday. 
 Who's Claire? 
 A girl from the school. 
 Sorry. Do you want some cereal 
 or something? 
 Uh, no. 
 I'll get 
 something later. 
 Dad. 
 Uh, let me talk to her mother. 
 Is your mom there? 
 Mark, I have an 8:00 
 thyroidectomy. 
 Hi, this is Mark Greene. 
 Yeah, Rachel's dad. Yeah. 
 I just was wanting to see 
 that you were going to be there. 
 How did you meet Claire? 
 She's my partner in art class. 
 Mm-hmm. What are you working on? 
 Yeah, okay, 
 All right. 
 Sculpture. 
 Call me after dinner 
 and I'll come pick you up. 
 Cool. 
 Mmm. 
 ( doorbell rings ) 
 Katherine's early. 
 Good. I don't need 
 to get dressed in the car. 
 Hi. Is Rachel ready? 
 Who are you? 
 Dad, this is Andrew. 
 He's giving me 
 a ride to school. 
 It's nice to meet you. 
 Here are your notes. 
 Dining room table. 
 When did this happen? 
 Oh, sorry, I forgot. 
 Andrew has a car 
 while his dad's out of town. 
 You have a license? 
 Yeah, well, I got it in June. 
 I have no accidents, you know. 
 Yeah, we can take you to school. 
 No, it's good. 
 Now you guys won't 
 be late for work. 
 Well, I guess she's 
 making friends. 
 I don't like 
 taking my clothes off. 
 LEWIS: 
 You'll have to if you 
 want to be examined. 
 Can't you just listen 
 to my stomach? 
 I think something's, 
 like, blown loose. 
 It keeps making 
 these weird noises. 
 Maybe you're hungry. 
 Yeah, and maybe 
 I'm bleeding into my belly. 
 Could it be a complication 
 from my surgery? 
 I don't know. 
 My X-ray vision 
 isn't working. 
 Are you mocking me? 
 No. 
 'Cause it sounds 
 like you're mocking me. 
 No, I'm taking you 
 very seriously 
 which is why I'm 
 going to examine you 
 as soon as you 
 get undressed. 
 You just want 
 to see me naked. 
 I want to examine you. 
 Yeah, examine me naked. 
 Can I get a male 
 doctor in here? 
 A straight one? 
 First day of school 
 and you're already 
 making new friends? 
 Oh, yeah, I'm a shoo-in 
 for homecoming queen. 
 So far, so good. 
 Oh, yeah. A 
 foul abscess 
 a neurotic granny, 
 naked boy here 
 and I had to break 
 into Chen's locker. 
 Did you steal 
 her stuff? 
 Weaver gave it to me. 
 Oh, what are you using 
 for maggots these days? 
 Cetacaine? 
 Good thought, 
 but Kerry's immune to it. 
 You're enjoying this, 
 aren't you? 
 Colonel Dixon's 
 Magical Maggot Mix. 
 Seriously. You paint 
 it on with milk. 
 The admit desk, 
 the patient status board. 
 The paramedic radio 
 is over this. 
 Dr. Greene and 
 Dr. Lewis-- 
 two of our 
 attendings. 
 Welcome. Don't k*ll anyone 
 and I'll mix you up 
 a fresh batch. 
 Dr. Lewis is a wealth 
 of medical knowledge 
 but do not ask her 
 where anything is. 
 She is just 
 getting reoriented 
 after a five-year 
 sabbatical herself. 
 Five years? 
 Post-traumatic stress. 
 What happened? 
 You don't want 
 to know. 
 Here, fill these out, 
 and then come find me. 
 Do you have a pen? 
 Come prepared. 
 Want the tour? 
 I think I can find 
 my way around again. 
 All right. 
 New group of 
 neophytes? 
 Yeah, I get 
 to baby-sit 'em, too. 
 Hey, it's the burden 
 of being Chief Resident. 
 You've heard. 
 Yes, I have. 
 Yes. 
 Oh, uh, nurse, nurse? 
 Nurse? 
 Are you talking to me? 
 I'm sorry. I don't 
 know your name. 
 Oh, you haven't met Abby yet. 
 No. 
 Abby Lockhart, Dr. Susan Lewis. 
 Dr. Susan Lewis, Abby Lockhart. 
 Hi. 
 Susan used to work here. 
 That's the rumor. 
 Abby, could you set 
 me up for suturing 
 in Exam Three? 
 Set you up? 
 Open a kit, some 4-0 nylon, 
 #7 gloves, betadine. 
 It's all in the room. 
 New chest pain in two. 
 Altered LOC over here. 
 Hey, Mooney. 
 I'll take it. 
 I want you to get started on 
 the chest pain here with Abby. 
 You know the routine. 
 Yay! 
 Oxygen, aspirin, nitro, 
 times three. 
 I can't believe 
 you are back. 
 Stanley, you're 
 with us. 
 You look great. 
 I love your hair. 
 Thanks. 
 My brother could 
 be dying here. 
 Oh, Howard Norden. 
 Ready, steady, lift. 
 No response to Narcan. 
 We were just talking. 
 That's it. 
 Talking. 
 Is he taking 
 any medications? 
 Uh, not that 
 he's told me about. 
 Lack of disconjugate gaze 
 and conjugate deviation 
 rules out a 
 structural lesion. 
 LEWIS: 
 CBC, chem panel, 12 lead 
 tox screen 
 and a Head CT. 
 Did he have a stroke or... 
 It's too early 
 to say. 
 The abrupt onset suggests 
 CNS bleed, seizure, even 
 cardiopulmonary anoxia. 
 Pulse ox is 99. 
 Don't let him die. 
 No tremor, asterixis, 
 of myoclonus 
 suggestive of a 
 metabolic encephalopathy. 
 I'm trying to listen. 
 You want a portable chest? 
 Ask Professor Carter. 
 MOONEY: 
 How would you describe 
 your pain? 
 It hurts. 
 Is it stabbing, 
 burning, tearing? 
 What's the freaking difference? 
 Okay. I'm going to give you 
 some medicine under your tongue. 
 And open. 
 Let me know 
 if it's better. 
 Was that three sprays? 
 Yeah, nitro times three. 
 At once? 
 I don't feel so good. 
 What's happening? 
 We're just going 
 to put your head down 
 for a minute there, 
 Mr. Stegman. 
 I feel so dizzy. 
 What? 
 Everything's blurry. 
 Okay, you're going to feel 
 a little bit more oxygen 
 flowing through your nose. 
 How's the pain 
 in your chest? 
 Worse. Oh! 
 80/60. 
 Is it bad? 
 No, just a little bit low. 
 Was that the wrong medicine? 
 No. Everything's okay. 
 This just happens sometimes. 
 Dr. Mooney is one 
 of our best. 
 I'll got write 
 my note. 
 Yeah, do that. 
 Neuroleptic malignant 
 syndrome. 
 It's in the differential. 
 Where did you come 
 up with that? 
 Photographic memory. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Oh, and I delivered a lecture 
 on coma last week. 
 Ridiculous. 
 What? 
 Time. Yesterday, it 
 seems you couldn't 
 start an IV. 
 Oh, it was longer 
 than yesterday. 
 LOCKHART: 
 Carter! 
 Yeah. 
 That kid Mooney 
 saw my patient. 
 Oh, how did he do? 
 What did you tell 
 him about nitro? 
 The basics. Three sprays. 
 Three sprays-- 
 that's right. 
 Bam, bam, bam. 
 All at once? 
 No, no. You're supposed 
 to give them every five minutes. 
 I think you left 
 that part out. 
 How's his pressure? 
 Zero over zero. He's dead. 
 I'm kidding. 
 Ha, ha. 
 I pulled him through. 
 Keep a short 
 leash on your 
 students, huh? 
 All clear. 
 I'm going to go check 
 on this guy. 
 You got this? 
 Yeah, I think so. 
 Did you see him get hit? 
 No, um, I went 
 to return the shopping cart 
 and he was just laying 
 by the car. 
 What have you got? 
 Weak pulse, 
 shallow resps. 
 What's your dad's name? 
 It's Alan. 
 Alan, can you 
 open your eyes? 
 GCS is 245. 
 Is he waking up? 
 Uh, not just yet. 
 Mark, look at this. 
 We need a backboard. 
 Blood count's normal. 
 ( metallic drilling ) 
 Chemistry is okay. 
 Nothing on 
 the tox screen. 
 All his labs 
 look good. 
 Why is he still in a coma? 
 How much longer 
 up there? 
 Has he ever seen 
 a psychiatrist? 
 I don't think so. 
 Sorry. 
 GREENE: 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, 
 whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Coming through. Need a portable 
 chest and pelvis. 
 Your brother has signs 
 of psychogenic coma. 
 What's that? 
 When we try to open his 
 eyelids, they flutter. 
 He responds to a 
 Q-tip in the nose. 
 I don't think 
 it's a real coma. 
 What do you mean, 
 he's faking? 
 ( drilling stops ) 
 What about the... 
 shaking and the frothing 
 at the mouth and everything? 
 I'd like to get 
 a psychiatric 
 consultation. 
 Yeah, yeah, 
 that'd be great. 
 He has been under 
 a lot of pressure lately. 
 Hey, what's 
 taking so long? 
 You're still dressed. 
 We'll move him 
 to a quieter room. 
 Great. 
 Don't I get a 
 gown at least? 
 I could catch cold. 
 It's bad enough 
 I'm bleeding out. 
 Go back to your bed 
 and the nurse 
 will bring you one. 
 How long till the psychiatrist 
 gets here? 
 I'll let you know. 
 Can I just talk 
 to my surgeon? 
 A British chick 
 with red hair. 
 Will you shut up? 
 Systolic's up to 100. 
 All right, let's roll him. 
 Set up the Sonosite for six. 
 Large abrasions to the back. 
 Did a car crush him 
 against something? 
 Uh, I-I didn't see. 
 Tracy? 
 Daddy. 
 GREENE: 
 Sir, you're in a hospital. 
 Do you know 
 what the date is? 
 Daddy, I'm so sorry, Daddy. 
 She didn't see me. 
 Alan. 
 What's he saying? 
 I don't know. 
 Sorry for what? 
 Were you in the car? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Looks like a liver lac. 
 I'll got get her. 
 All right, let's intubate, 
 etomidate, and sux. 
 Where were you stationed? 
 In Birmingham. 
 I have an uncle 
 in Birmingham. 
 Does he work 
 in the steel mills? 
 The university. 
 We handled mail 
 for seven million soldiers. 
 65,000 pieces every eight hours. 
 My goodness. 
 Nothing beats a letter 
 from home. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ( groaning ): 
 Ooh! 
 What do you think? 
 It's a perforation. 
 A small hole in the colon. 
 It's from her diverticular 
 disease. 
 I'm afraid you'll need 
 an operation to fix it. 
 But she's so weak. 
 It's really the 
 only option. 
 Well, can't we wait 
 a few days? 
 Then she'll become 
 extremely ill 
 and surgery could 
 be dangerous. 
 If I were your mother 
 would you recommend 
 the operation? 
 Absolutely. 
 Then we'll do it. 
 LEWIS: 
 Dr. Corday? 
 I have a Mr. Ashman, says 
 you repaired his hernia. 
 Chubby, drug-seeking 
 hypochondriac. 
 I don't know 
 about drug-seeking. 
 Complains of 
 abdominal pain. 
 What's his exam like? 
 Didn't do one. 
 Then why are you 
 talking to me? 
 Some surgeons like to treat 
 their patients primarily. 
 Not this one. 
 Well, he's going to 
 say he's tender. 
 You'll be seeing 
 him eventually. 
 Maybe, maybe not. 
 Oh, I'm pretty certain. 
 Abby? 
 Malik. 
 Who gets the vent? 
 Curtain Three. 
 I have to start 
 a dopamine drip. 
 Curtain Two, 
 abdominal pain. 
 He's still 
 fully clothed. 
 Okay. 
 He needs a gown, 
 don't you think? 
 Sure. 
 ( loud whacking ) 
 Stop! 
 Ow! 
 Hey! 
 Somebody! Ah! 
 You thought you could fool me? 
 Is that it? 
 Mr. Norden. 
 ( screaming ) 
 Stop it! 
 Security. 
 You take a loan 
 from Mr. Bennett 
 he expects his money back. 
 You pay it by Monday 
 or next time 
 it's going 
 to be your head. 
 You understand? 
 I need a nurse 
 in here. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Are you all right? 
 He broke my legs. 
 He's not your 
 brother? 
 Would you like me 
 to call your mom? 
 No. 
 It's just us. 
 God, we were having 
 such a great day, too. 
 He just... 
 He took me out to lunch 
 'cause I got into law school. 
 Early acceptance? 
 He even... 
 He even laminated a copy 
 of the letter to his toolbox. 
 Well, what is that? 
 What are they doing? 
 They're just 
 taking X-rays. 
 Oh, is something broken? 
 He may have a 
 crushed pelvis. 
 I mean, is that really bad? 
 Possibly. 
 He might need surgery. 
 Oh, God. 
 He had to have been run over 
 or pinned against something. 
 It... 
 It was a wall. 
 What? 
 Look, I... 
 I thought I was in reverse. 
 It was such a tight space. 
 He was out front, 
 waiting for me to back out. 
 I thought... 
 I thought it was in reverse. 
 Mr. Stegman's 
 troponin is positive. 
 I sent Mooney 
 to the library. 
 Good call. 
 C.P.K. on Norton. 
 That's Susan's 
 patient. 
 Dr. Lewis. 
 She always been so 
 high-maintenance? 
 She's not high-maintenance. 
 She's great. 
 I like her. 
 Abby, could you get 
 a rectal temp in Room Four? 
 Anything else? 
 That should do it. 
 Hey, I heard about 
 your hit man. 
 Oh, more like 
 an enforcer. 
 Well, never 
 a dull moment. 
 I could use 
 a dull moment. 
 Okay, pick a chart, 
 any chart. 
 This is a setup. 
 No, just go 
 ahead. Pick. 
 You sure? 
 No. 
 ( giggles softly ) 
 Female abdominal pain? 
 What you got? 
 Suture removal. 
 This is definitely 
 a setup. 
 On a scrotum. 
 Oh, maybe not. 
 All right, 
 where is he? 
 Who? 
 Mr. Ashman, I assume. 
 You paged 
 for a consult. 
 Curtain Two. 
 Epigastric tenderness 
 on exam. 
 As predicted. 
 I have the touch. 
 Better hurry 
 before he finds his clothes. 
 Dr. Corday, there's a code 
 in the S.I.C.U. 
 One of your patients. 
 You'll have to 
 keep them hidden. 
 Amal? 
 WOMAN: 
 Yes. 
 Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. 
 How long have you had 
 your stomach trouble? 
 Since yesterday. 
 How long is this 
 going to take? 
 Well, I don't know. 
 It depends 
 on what's wrong. 
 Well, I need to be 
 home in two hours. 
 No matter what. 
 MAN: 
 Pressure's good: 110/60. 
 BENTON: 
 T.K.O. the saline. 
 Send up the 
 last two O-neg. 
 Is he going 
 to be okay? 
 He's responding 
 to blood transfusions 
 but he needs surgery 
 to repair his liver. 
 Hold the elevator. 
 Well, can I go 
 up with him? 
 Malik, can you take her 
 to the surgical waiting room? 
 Why don't you 
 just wait right here 
 and I'll come back 
 and get you. 
 MAN: 
 Dr. Greene. 
 You want 
 one shot I.V.P? 
 We'll do it upstairs. 
 That's two-plus 
 for heme. 
 Got it. 
 Dr. Greene. 
 Did you get a B.A.L. 
 on the daughter? 
 What? 
 I smelled alcohol 
 on her breath. 
 D.U.I. with bodily injuries 
 is a felony. 
 She wasn't driving. 
 Now she says she was. 
 Did you get the C.T.? 
 Radiology's waiting. 
 Peter took him 
 straight to the O.R. 
 She's changing 
 her story. 
 It's an admission 
 of guilt. 
 Kerry, did you smell 
 alcohol on the daughter? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 Okay, is she 
 in custody? 
 Are you arresting her? 
 You could still draw 
 a level. 
 Give her a break. 
 Her father's 
 in critical condition. 
 Because she hit him 
 with the car 
 while under the influence. 
 Doesn't seem drunk to me. 
 Forget it. 
 I was asking a favor. 
 But I'll call 
 a phlebotomist from... 
 Wait, hold on. 
 You'll get your draw. 
 Just wait until her dad's 
 out of surgery. 
 How long is that 
 going to be? 
 Couple hours. 
 My sergeant wants me back 
 on the streets. 
 I can't stay here 
 and baby-sit. 
 Well, come back. 
 She's not going to go anywhere. 
 Take your time, 
 and think it over. 
 No, you don't understand. 
 I have to have an abortion. 
 You have other 
 options, you know. 
 No, not for me. 
 My parents are so strict. 
 They'll k*ll me. 
 Everybody thinks that. 
 No, it's 
 different for us. 
 I have to be a virgin 
 on my wedding day. 
 I think if you 
 give them the chance... 
 No. If they find out 
 that I've had sex... 
 I'm no longer 
 their daughter. 
 They'll send me away... 
 out of the country 
 and I don't want 
 to live there. 
 I can't. 
 Hmm... 
 What? 
 Do you know what 
 an ectopic pregnancy is? 
 A miscarriage? 
 Not exactly. 
 It's where the fetus grows 
 in the Fallopian tube. 
 So, then I have 
 to have an abortion. 
 It's more complicated 
 than that. 
 You'll need surgery. 
 An operation? 
 Right now. 
 Well, how long 
 does it take? 
 You leave the hospital 
 by tomorrow. 
 No, I have to be home 
 for dinner in an hour. 
 If you don't have surgery 
 immediately, it could rupture 
 and you'll bleed to death. 
 Then I'll come back Saturday. 
 You may not make it 
 to Saturday. 
 I don't care. 
 I need a doctor 
 in Trauma One right now. 
 You know what, we'll 
 figure something out. 
 Pregnancy is confidential. 
 We don't have to tell 
 your parents. 
 Dr. Lewis, 
 status epilepticus. 
 Okay. You stay right there. 
 I'll be right back, 
 okay, Amal? 
 Amal, okay? 
 TAKATA: 
 Paramedics gave 
 four of Ativan 
 but she's 
 still seizing. 
 How's the airway? 
 Pulse ox is borderline. 
 You may have to tube her. 
 Give another two 
 of Ativan. 
 Oh, you got this one? 
 Who are you? 
 Susan Lewis. 
 It's, uh, my first day. 
 Oh. Resident? 
 Attending. 
 Tachy at 130. 
 Right. 
 We'll do it together. 
 Okay. 
 How long has 
 she been seizing? 
 MAN: 
 We got the call 
 20 minutes ago. 
 Any history? 
 Husband only speaks Spanish. 
 Okay, let's prep 
 a gram of Dilantin. 
 I'll intubate. 
 We should intubate. 
 Go ahead. 
 Push 70 of Zemuron. 
 TAKATA: 
 What? 
 Rocuronium. 
 I have to go 
 to the pharmacy. 
 It's the best 
 nondepolarizing agent. 
 Maybe, but we 
 don't stock it. 
 100 of sux. 
 I'll get the airway. 
 ( clears throat ) 
 Push the Dilantin. 
 360. Clear. 
 Still in fib. 
 How long since 
 Cordarone? 
 20 minutes. 
 360 again. 
 Give an amp of epi. 
 I just did. 
 Trying to raise 
 the dead, Lizzie? 
 Clear. 
 Septic hemocolectomy 
 maxed out on Dopamine 
 and Levophed. 
 Asystole. 
 Go directly to the morgue. 
 Do not pass ""Go."" 
 Do not collect $200. 
 Okay, that's it. 
 I'll call the family. 
 Not that I'm 
 keeping score 
 but isn't this your 
 third postop death 
 this week? 
 Congratulations. 
 We call that 
 a hat trick. 
 Thousand of Dilantin 
 on board. 
 Get ready with phenobarb. 
 The husband. 
 Sir, does your wife 
 have epilepsy? 
 ?Epilepsia¬ø 
 Creo quo no. 
 Can we get a 
 translator? 
 No, it's okay. 
 ?Esta tomando medicinas¬ø 
 Solamente una. 
 Es una droga 
 para prevenir 
 tuberculosis. 
 ?Come se llama medicina¬ø 
 Tengo la botella. 
 She's on an anti-TB med. 
 Isoniazid. 
 ?Toma algunas mas¬ø 
 No. Como dice alli, 
 once cada dia. 
 ?Once pastillas¬ø 
 Si. 
 No, solamente una al dia. 
 What? 
 It's an overdose 
 because the label 
 is in English. 
 It says, ""Take once a day."" 
 ""O-n-c-e."" 
 In Spanish that means 11-- once. 
 She took 11 pills a day? 
 We need Pyridoxine. 
 At least six grams. 
 It's the only way 
 we're going to stop this. 
 ?Doctora 
 puedes ayadarla¬ø 
 Si, vamos a ayudar. 
 Pavulon while we wait. 
 What did you say? 
 I said we'd help her. 
 I am diabetic. 
 I need water. 
 Well, then, we'll 
 start an I.V. for you. 
 Oh, nyet. 
 I drink, I throw up, 
 I feel better. 
 No, no, 
 nothing to drink. 
 You have gall stones 
 the size of golf balls. 
 ( speaking Russian ) 
 I have golf stones? 
 You have gallstones. 
 Abby, can you 
 start a line here? 
 What? 
 The crash cart. 
 He's crashing. 
 What happened? 
 It looks like V-tach. 
 CARTER: 
 Does he have a pulse? 
 I don't think so. 
 Charge to 200. 
 Stanley, have you ever 
 shocked a patient before? 
 Uh, no. 
 Okay, this one's 
 all yours. 
 No, that's okay. 
 I am right here. 
 Charged and ready. 
 I want you to apply 
 firm pressure 
 and before you press 
 the buttons 
 back off... 
 say ""clear."" 
 Okay. 
 Clear! 
 ( Carter groans ) 
 Did you get shocked? 
 You were supposed to say ""clear"" 
 before, not after. 
 Normal sinus rhythm! 
 I've got a pulse! 
 Well, so does he, 
 thank God. 
 Were you touching 
 the bedframe? 
 E.K.G. lead? 
 No, his arm, 
 right here... 
 Ouch! Hold on. 
 I'll get you 
 an ice pack. 
 Feels like someone 
 kicked me in the chest. 
 Well.. consider yourself 
 lucky, Mr. Stegman. 
 How long 
 has she been seizing? 
 Almost an hour. 
 Four grams of 
 Pyridoxine on board. 
 She needs one gram 
 per gram ingested. 
 Give another four. 
 We don't have 
 another four. 
 Go to the pharmacy. 
 I can't. 
 Send another nurse. 
 This is all we had 
 in the whole hospital. 
 Okay, send couriers to Mercy, 
 Northwestern, Parkside... 
 Parkside closed last year. 
 Every nearby hospital. 
 We need all 
 the Pyridoxine 
 we can get. 
 V-fib. Starting compressions. 
 Charge to 200. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Damn it. 
 The daughter was driving? 
 Yeah. Crushed him up 
 against a brick wall. 
 You wonder why 
 I don't have kids. 
 Lizzie, what you got? 
 Perfed diverticulum. 
 Yeah, well, be sure 
 you clean under 
 your fingernails. 
 Don't want another 
 postop infection. 
 Dr. Benton, there's 
 a Roger McGrath 
 on the phone. 
 Dr. Benton's in surgery. 
 Take a message. 
 He says it's important. 
 All right, 
 hold the phone. 
 He's crashing! 
 Get me four more units 
 of packed cells! 
 Let's go, Peter. 
 Good news can wait. 
 Bad news 
 will never go away. 
 I'll call him back. 
 LEWIS: 
 Hold compressions. 
 Asystole. 
 Start pacing at 140. 
 Courier's got 
 Pyridozine from Mercy. 
 Will be here 
 in ten minutes. 
 Turn up the gain. 
 No capture. 
 Resume compressions. 
 How long has she been down? 
 No cardiac activity 
 for 35 minutes. 
 You want to keep going? 
 pH is 6.8. 
 ( sighs ) 
 We'll never get her back. 
 I'm calling it. 
 Stop C.P.R. 
 Put the husband 
 in a quiet room. 
 I'll be right there. 
 Good pickup. 
 Once. 
 I would have missed 
 the diagnosis. 
 Lot of good it did. 
 Feeling any better? 
 Yeah, the boys bounce back 
 quick. 
 Ow! Oh, I think I might've 
 tweaked it again. 
 You want to have 
 another doctor take 
 a look at your back? 
 How about your front? 
 ( woman retching violently ) 
 She's tossing 
 her cookies. 
 No, cookies. 
 Chicken, potato, and ice cream. 
 Oh, Dr. Carter. 
 I'm really sorry. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Should we order an X-ray? 
 No. It's just a spasm. 
 It could be somatic dysfunction 
 at the myofascial junction. 
 What? 
 I studied alternative medicine 
 in Hong Kong. 
 I could try a muscle 
 energy technique. 
 You know, I think 
 you've done enough 
 for one day. 
 Okay, help me mobilize 
 the liver. 
 Bovie and pickups. 
 Peter! Where's Reese? 
 What? 
 Reese isn't in the playroom. 
 You were supposed 
 to pick him up 
 at school. 
 I tried; he wasn't there. 
 Free up 
 the falciform. 
 Where is he? 
 I thought you had him here 
 in daycare. 
 No. 
 Who let this guy in? 
 Carla's mother pick him up? 
 No. 
 Systolic's down to 60. 
 Four-sucker bleed. 
 Lap pads, let's pack 
 off the liver. 
 All right. 
 Her name is, uh, 
 on the card at school. 
 Okay. I'll try her. 
 Yeah, good idea. You call 
 Grandma, you call Grandpa 
 and I'll roll 
 this guy over 
 so we can all kiss his ass 
 good-bye! 
 Sign here. 
 Corday finally see him? 
 No. I drank that 
 Russian water. 
 Yetna's water? 
 Yeah, I'm better now. 
 No thanks to you. 
 Here, take this; 
 you're going to need it later. 
 Have you seen the 
 girl in Exam One? 
 She took off. 
 What?! 
 She said she'd be back 
 at 9:00. 
 Why didn't 
 anyone get me? 
 Because you were busy 
 with the arrest. 
 She has an ectopic. 
 Well, you didn't 
 tell me that. 
 Where's her chart? 
 It's here, somewhere. 
 Could you find it, 
 please? 
 Okay. 
 Could you pull up Razavi 
 on the computer 
 Sure. 
 and print out 
 her ""redge"" sheet? 
 Excuse me. We're here 
 to see Dr. Carter. 
 She fainted. 
 I did not faint. 
 I was dizzy. 
 You'll need to see 
 a triage nurse. 
 Is that you? 
 Through those doors 
 and to the right. 
 I think we should go 
 through those doors 
 and right back to the car. 
 Please, John Carter... 
 Dr. Carter's very busy. 
 John! 
 Excuse me. If you want 
 to see a doctor 
 you need to sign in 
 at Triage. 
 Gamma, what are you 
 doing here? 
 Ask him. 
 She fainted outside 
 Marshal Fields. 
 I did not. 
 Did you hit your head? 
 No. I didn't faint. 
 This is your grandmother? 
 Uh, Gamma, 
 this is Susan Lewis. 
 Pleasure. 
 I'm terribly sorry, 
 ma'am. 
 Well, I guess you're 
 only rude to strangers. 
 Mrs. Wilson! 
 Mrs. Wilson, 
 your surgery 
 went very well. 
 ( mumbling ): 
 Yeah. 
 You're finished? 
 Yes. You're on your 
 way to Recovery. 
 Good. 
 I need your address. 
 I got to send you 
 at thank-you note. 
 Dr. Corday? 
 Dr. Corday? 
 Yes. 
 Carmen Torino from 
 Infection Control. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 What do you need? 
 To speak to you 
 in private. 
 Okay. Keep her fluids 
 at 125 an hour. 
 Vitals Q-15, CBC in 30. 
 You lost another patient 
 today, from sepsis. 
 Uh, yes, but, uh, he was 
 debilitated before surgery. 
 I understand. 
 However, his death triggered 
 a formal investigation 
 by my department. 
 Excuse me? 
 You need to be cultured. 
 Cultured? 
 In case your body's 
 carrying bacteria 
 that's infecting 
 your patients. 
 Can you stop by the clinic 
 in an hour? 
 I'm afraid that's 
 impossible. 
 I have a patient waiting 
 for me downstairs. 
 Your surgical privileges 
 could be suspended 
 if you don't cooperate. 
 If you have concerns, 
 talk to my chairman. 
 I already have. 
 Drs. Romano and Anspaugh 
 have given us 
 their full support. 
 GREENE: 
 Did she sign out AMA? 
 No. 
 Call her back. 
 She thinks she'll 
 be deported if her 
 parents find out. 
 Tell her parents that she needs 
 surgery for an ovarian cyst. 
 And falsify 
 a consent form? 
 I'd rather keep them 
 in the dark. 
 She's pregnant. 
 They don't have 
 to know anything. 
 Hmm. You trust her 
 to come back? 
 I think so. 
 I hope so. 
 Dr. Greene, 
 Dr. Corday on Two. 
 You home yet? 
 Susan, hi. 
 Uh, I heard you lost one, 
 the INH overdose. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, those can be tough. 
 How long is 
 it going to take? 
 Um, anyway, I've been meaning 
 to talk to you 
 Uh-huh. 
 about the nursing shortage. 
 That blood alcohol came back 
 just over the limit. 
 What? 
 The girl, 
 who hit her father-- .092. 
 Is he still in surgery? 
 Want me to tell a cop? 
 No. I will. 
 Anyway, if you could 
 pitch in a little 
 it'll make 
 everyone happy. 
 The nurses are complaining? 
 Yeah, I explained 
 that you're used 
 to better staffing 
 so, you know, 
 they'll cut 
 you some slack 
 until you're up 
 to speed. 
 Okay, okay. No problem. 
 Can you cover my last hour? 
 Aw, my first day back 
 you're already 
 dumping on me. 
 Elizabeth's stuck. 
 I have to get home to the baby. 
 L.P. results are pending 
 on Etzler 
 and Nguyen's getting a V.Q. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah, you could pick me up 
 some milk and Huggies 
 on the way home. 
 B.P.'s 120/80. 
 ROMANO: 
 Excellent. 
 Take down the packing. 
 Peter! 
 Carla's mom has been 
 home all day. 
 Try Jackie. 
 I tried. I got Joanie. 
 Did she pick him up? 
 No. 
 Retrohepatic caval injury. 
 More suction. 
 Call the police, now. 
 I got to go. 
 Lost another two liters. 
 Sternal saw. Peter, 
 do a pringle before 
 the guy bleeds out. 
 Shirley, go get Edson. 
 Prep a number 
 eight atrial shunt. 
 I need to be relieved. 
 Peter, you take your hands 
 off his liver 
 and he's going to die! 
 Your EKG looks good. 
 I told you, I'm fine. 
 Alger means well 
 but sometimes, 
 he's annoyingly 
 condescending. 
 You gave him a scare. 
 I was a little woozy 
 getting out of the car. 
 We call that near syncope. 
 I call it 
 skipping lunch. 
 You need to eat. 
 I'll do it. 
 You been sleeping okay? 
 ( sighs ) 
 Are you, uh, depressed? 
 I miss him, John. 
 Me, too. 
 Have you thought 
 about therapy? 
 I said, I miss him. 
 I'm not mentally unstable. 
 Sometimes, it's good 
 to talk about it. 
 What's to talk about? 
 He's gone. 
 And I have things to do. 
 If I leave now, 
 I can still make 
 the Donor's Reception. 
 Whoa. We need to monitor 
 your heart overnight. 
 In here? 
 I don't think so. 
 Well, let's just wait 
 I've been waiting. 
 I've already missed 
 two appointments. 
 If everything checks out 
 you'll be back 
 on your feet tomorrow. 
 There are no more tomorrows, 
 John. 
 This is it. 
 Your grandfather and I used 
 to think 
 we had a lifetime of tomorrows. 
 Hello, is Amal there? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Uh, this is Susan, 
 her friend from school. 
 I just had a question 
 about our math homework. 
 Oh, okay, great. 
 Yeah, I'll call back after 
 dinner. Okay, thanks. 
 Dr. Lewis, 
 Mr. Gadasco's still waiting? 
 Who? 
 His wife died-- 
 the overdose. 
 Oh, my... Oh, damn it! 
 I completely forgot. 
 Se√±or Gadasco... 
 ¬øComo sigue, doctora? 
 Le dimos el antidoto, 
 pero siguido convulsionando. 
 Parace grave. 
 Convulsiono tanto que le dio 
 un ataque del corazon. 
 Dios mio. 
 Le dimos choque electrico 
 y todo el medicamento 
 para salvarla, 
 pero no respondio. 
 Trabajamos con ella 
 por dos horas 
 pero se murio. 
 No. 
 No! 
 No! No! No! 
 Lo siento mucho. 
 ¬øComo es posible 
 que eso paso? 
 Emilio... 
 ¬øQue voy a hacer, se√±ora? 
 ¬øQue voy a hacer? 
 Once. La bottella decia once. 
 Yo se. Calmate, por favor. 
 Calmate. 
 Seguimos las direcciones. 
 Pensabamos que estamos 
 haciendo todo bien. 
 Yo se... que debe 
 ser dificil... 
 ¬øQue les digo 
 a mis hijos? 
 ¬øPorque tuvo que pasar? 
 Lo siento. 
 ¬øPorque tuvo que pasar? 
 Lo siento mucho. 
 ( gasping ) 
 Sorry. 
 It has to be 
 a nasopharyngeal sample. 
 Oh! 
 Ooh, sorry. 
 Felt more like 
 a brain biopsy. 
 The enterobacter 
 from you patients is 
 a very resistant strain. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 You may be colonized. 
 Open wide. 
 Quick swab 
 of the tonsils. 
 ( choking ) 
 God... 
 So, are we finished? 
 Just need to do a pelvic. 
 You've got be kidding. 
 A surgical tech in Ohio 
 was passing nocardia 
 from her vaginal flora. 
 Thank you for sharing that. 
 I'm nursing. 
 You want a sample 
 of my milk as well? 
 Absolutely. 
 Then a cath'd urine 
 and a stool sample. 
 If you can't go now, 
 you can take it home 
 and bring it back 
 in the morning. 
 ROMANO: 
 Inflate the balloon 
 and tighten the rumel. 
 WOMAN: 
 How is he? Is he 
 going to be okay? 
 They're still 
 working on him. 
 Why did you leave him? 
 There's another surgeon 
 with him. 
 How much longer? 
 Look, I have 
 another emergency 
 so just wait 
 in the room, okay. 
 They want us to come 
 to the station and 
 make out a report. 
 This is Dr. Benton 
 at County General. 
 Listen, I need you to send 
 a detective down here. 
 I don't care! 
 My son is missing! 
 So get off your ass, do your job 
 and send someone down now! 
 What's the ETA? 
 Two minutes. 
 Flip you for the airway. 
 He's already 
 intubated. 
 What are we getting? 
 Mercy's sending us a GSW, 
 and we're out of beds. 
 You coming? 
 Yeah, I need gloves. 
 Move Trauma One to Exam One... 
 Whose chart is this? 
 Oh, that's mine. 
 Code the charts 
 at the time of discharge 
 so they can go to billing. 
 I'll do it right now. 
 Yeah, and be sure 
 the nurse's notes... 
 Did this patient leave 
 the hospital? 
 I'm not sure. 
 You're not sure? 
 She an ectopic. 
 It's under control. 
 What do you mean? 
 She's not here. 
 It's complicated. 
 I'm trying to protect 
 her privacy. 
 You should be trying 
 to protect her life. 
 She'll be back 
 in two hours. 
 If she's 
 still alive! 
 Lost his pulse 
 on the scene. 
 I gave her my word 
 I wouldn't tell her parents. 
 You're putting her 
 life at risk 
 so she doesn't 
 get into trouble. 
 You have to trust me 
 on this one. 
 Prep for a thoracotomy. 
 Okay, give me the gown. 
 Call your patient 
 right now. 
 You're being completely 
 irresponsible. 
 If she's sick, 
 they can bring her in. 
 Not if she's dead. 
 You got too many names 
 on the list. 
 Everyone helps out. 
 How's the school supposed 
 to keep track of ten people? 
 Any stranger could say 
 he was his uncle. 
 We've never had 
 a problem before. 
 You sure you got 
 there on time? 
 Yes. 
 Hey, what are 
 you doing here? 
 Where were you? 
 Hey. 
 ( sighs ) 
 What's going on? 
 You picked him 
 up from school? 
 Yeah. 
 He was acting out. 
 He bit a little girl. 
 You were in surgery, 
 so they called me. 
 Yeah, well, you had us worried. 
 I left a message 
 on your voice mail. 
 It wasn't Peter's 
 night to pick him 
 up, it was mine. 
 You're still picking him up? 
 We have dinner every 
 Tuesday and Thursday. 
 He's had three fights 
 at recess this week. 
 Hey, you fighting? 
 The teacher wants to know 
 if there are any problems 
 at home. 
 She thinks he may need 
 a little more stability. 
 What are you 
 trying to say? 
 Just telling you 
 what she said. 
 He wasn't getting 
 in fights when he 
 was living with us. 
 Know what? Maybe he 
 should just live in 
 one home for a while. 
 Peter, he's my stepson. 
 We've got an agreement. 
 Yeah, but we need to think 
 about what's best for Reese. 
 Well, if he's 
 acting out 
 maybe it's because 
 he lost his mother. 
 Hey, hey, hey, look. 
 We'll talk about this later. 
 I just need to go call 
 the police and get him home. 
 All right? 
 Dr. Weaver? 
 Yeah? 
 O.R. called. 
 They don't think 
 Mr. Pomeroy's 
 going to make it. 
 Okay, I'll go up. 
 Can you do the coroner's forms? 
 Yeah. Hey, Chuni, 
 can you tell my grandmother 
 I'll be about 
 five more minutes? 
 And see if Dr. Lewis called 
 that ectopic girl. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Gamma! 
 What are you doing? 
 It's late, John. 
 I've been a good sport. 
 No, no, no, you 
 cannot leave. 
 Fainting can be 
 a warning sign 
 for a heart attack, 
 for stroke... 
 I'll take my chances. 
 Well, if you leave now, 
 you're going to be 
 signing out against 
 medical advice. 
 I've already done that. 
 Come on, there's still 
 some more tests 
 we can do. 
 I'll see you 
 at home, John. 
 Don't forget 
 to turn out 
 the porch light 
 when you come in. 
 Check on her in 
 about an hour. 
 Good night. 
 Sorry if I offended her. 
 Oh, don't worry 
 about it. 
 She never takes 
 me seriously. 
 What do you expect? 
 She changed your diapers. 
 That's true. 
 Any focal neuro findings? 
 EKG changes? 
 No, I monitored her 
 for three hours. 
 Yeah, she should be okay. 
 Weaver's looking for you. 
 Did you call your 
 ectopic girl? 
 I'm going to give her 
 till 9:00. 
 It's a bit of a risk. 
 Danger is my middle name. 
 Any other catastrophes? 
 It's been like 
 an acid flashback 
 without the good parts. 
 I don't know 
 what I was thinking 
 when I said I'd come back. 
 You weren't, but at least 
 you're working with friends. 
 Yes. 
 Excuse me, uh, Pickman's got 
 a woman in active labor. 
 Show time. 
 ( woman groans ) 
 Denise Frankel. 
 Full-term. 
 She's crowning. 
 ""Show time"" 
 is right. 
 ( screams ) 
 Oh, I need to push. 
 Go ahead, push. 
 ( moans ) 
 Membrane's ruptured, 
 fluid looks clear. 
 How many other 
 kids have you had? 
 Two. 
 ABBY: 
 This one's coming fast. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Take your foot off the pedal. 
 I'm not on it. 
 The bed's rising. 
 Your foot must... 
 I'm nowhere near it. 
 Must be... a short? 
 What's happening? 
 Just a little 
 technical difficulty. 
 Oh, man. 
 Water broke, it must have 
 flooded the switch. 
 Late decel. Okay, we have to get 
 this baby out. 
 I can't deliver 
 the baby like this. 
 Well, get Luka. 
 He's tall. 
 Carter, 
 take over. 
 What-- where 
 are you going? 
 What are you doing? 
 Excuse me? 
 Get down. Get down. 
 Okay, just blow, just 
 blow through the pain. 
 Drop your arm over the side. 
 I need to start an IV. 
 Give me a hand. 
 Oh, you're 
 kidding me? 
 What are you doing? 
 Just setting up 
 some equipment. 
 Fetal heart 
 rate's 140. 
 Don't drop my baby. 
 Don't worry, 
 Dr. Carter 
 used to be 
 in the circus. 
 Yeah, as 
 a clown, right? 
 Human cannonball... 
 until I got fired. 
 Okay, give a big push. 
 Push. 
 Push. 
 Head's out. 
 Relax. 
 Cord's tight 
 around the neck. 
 Can you reduce it? 
 Uh, I don't think so. 
 How about a clamp? 
 Toss it. 
 Second clamp. 
 Scissors. 
 Is it a boy or a girl? 
 One more push, 
 and we're about to find out. 
 ( groans ) 
 ( yells ) 
 It's a boy. 
 Is he okay? 
 Oh, he's beautiful. 
 Can I see him? 
 Yeah, as soon as we strap on 
 a parachute. 
 Ooh, yeah. 
 Hi, Mom. 
 ( sighs ) 
 ( laughs ) 
 ( sobbing ): 
 I k*lled him. 
 I k*lled him. 
 I k*lled him. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I k*lled him. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 No. No... 
 I need to see him. 
 I need to see him. 
 Miss Pomeroy? 
 What? 
 We're going to 
 have to leave now. 
 What? What do you mean? 
 What are you talk-- 
 I'm required to place 
 you under arrest. 
 It was an accident. 
 He was my father. 
 Is this really 
 necessary? 
 We only had a couple 
 of glasses of wine. 
 We only had a couple 
 of glasses of wine. 
 Let her say good-bye. 
 Where is he? Where 
 did you put him? 
 Let her say good-bye. 
 Where is he? 
 This way. 
 Oh, God, I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I got Ella's 
 diaper culture. 
 Oh, you didn't need 
 to do that, Mark. 
 Hey, not with the food. 
 I triple-bagged them. 
 Did I hear 
 a phone ring? 
 No. 
 She still 
 hasn't called? 
 Not yet. 
 The party was 
 over at 8:00. 
 I know. 
 So, call her. 
 I don't have her 
 phone number. 
 Look it up. 
 I didn't get 
 Claire's last name. 
 Mark, if your 
 daughter's 
 at a party 
 you need to know 
 these things. 
 Yeah, well, 
 I talked to the parents. 
 I thought everything 
 was okay. 
 We don't even know 
 where she is. 
 RACHEL: 
 I told you 
 about the party. 
 Do you know 
 what time it is? 
 It's only 10:15. 
 You were supposed 
 to call me two hours ago. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How'd you get home? 
 Andrew. 
 I think I'll check on 
 the little one. 
 All they had were 
 hot dogs and burgers 
 so some of us 
 went out to eat. 
 Uh-huh, ""some of us,"" 
 or you and Andrew? 
 Dad? 
 I need to know these things. 
 That sounds 
 like something 
 Mom would say. 
 I wasn't drinking. 
 I'm not doing dr*gs. 
 I'm just making some 
 new friends, okay? 
 All you had to do was call. 
 I tried. 
 The pay phone was broken. 
 If you don't believe me, 
 call the restaurant. 
 Don't ever let 
 this happen again. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 You know, if I had 
 a cell phone 
 we could keep in touch. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Seriously, just 
 for emergencies. 
 We'll see. 
 Thanks. 
 You guys do good work. 
 So do you. 
 I'll call you when 
 it's time to build 
 his tree house. 
 ( laughs ) 
 Amal? 
 Dr. Lewis. 
 I'm so sorry I'm late. 
 It was really hard 
 to sneak out. 
 I am so glad 
 you came back. 
 I told the nurse 
 I'd be here at 9:00. 
 Well, people say 
 a lot of things. 
 You said it 
 was important. 
 Mm-hmm. Abby, 
 can you find us a room? 
 Yeah. 
 Good to see you. 
 Uh... where's her chart? 
 Weaver's got it. 
 Amal's chart? 
 Yeah. 
 Why? 
 I don't know. 
 Where is she? 
 I don't know. 
 She's on a call 
 in the lounge. 
 Oh, damn it. 
 Get off the phone. 
 Yeah, I work at 
 the E.R. in County... 
 She's here, you don't 
 have to call. 
 Susan... 
 I told you, 
 she'd be back. 
 Who? 
 Amal, the ectopic. 
 I didn't call her. 
 Oh. 
 Hello. Hi. 
 I'm sorry we got disconnected. 
 No, actually, I got your number 
 from an investigator 
 who specializes 
 in finding birth parents. 
 Did you give up 
 a daughter for adoption? 
 I understand. 
 No, I-I... 
 I am sorry. 
 I thought this was 
 from a reliable source. 
 I won't-- 
 I will not bother you again.

 I've arranged 
 a nurse's aide for you 
 for while I'm at work. 
 A nurse? 
 Just for 
 a couple weeks. 
 I've got half a dozen people 
 in this house every day. 
 Well, then one more 
 isn't going to hurt. 
 If it gets 
 any colder 
 I'm going to winter 
 in the Bahamas. 
 Alone. 
 I thought 
 I heard someone. 
 Is it just me

 I assumed you

 How are you

 I've been better. 
 Where's Jack? 
 Uh, Kansas City, 
 I think. 
 You don't know? 
 He's on an extended

 We missed the pleasure

 You know how 
 the holidays can be. 
 Where are you staying? 
 I was hoping 
 to stay here. 
 In the house? 
 Yes, if that's

 Yeah.

 Hi, I'm Joyce. 
 We just moved here 
 a few weeks ago 
 from Virginia. 
 Hi. Abby. 
 We're in 205. 
 I think you guys 
 are right beside me. 
 Nice meeting you. 
 So, I guess 
 we're neighbors. 
 Just a wall 
 between us. 
 Well, maybe, uh, 
 you could come over 
 for coffee or 
 something sometime. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, can we give you 
 a ride somewhere? 
 No, thank you. 
 Are you sure? 
 It's really cold 
 out there. 
 I'm fine. 
 I told you. 
 You flooded it. 
 Welcome to Chicago. 
 Oh! 
 Oh, son of a bitch. 
 You're leaving? 
 I phoned the Pediatric 
 Cancer Society 
 to inform them she wasn't 
 coming to their luncheon 
 and they managed 
 to corral me. 
 You don't really 
 have to do that. 
 She wasn't 
 planning on going. 
 She just does that 
 for effect. 
 I'm aware 
 of her behavior. 
 But they actually 
 were expecting her. 
 You'll be back tonight? 
 You're really staying? 
 Yes. 
 Unless I'm not welcome. 
 No, no, it's just... 
 I thought 
 you were covering. 
 Dad's in Denver, 
 actually. 
 Your father told you. 
 Well, it was 
 pretty obvious. 
 He was here for two days 
 at Christmas without you. 
 You thought 
 he was still here. 
 Uh, we, uh, left it 
 a little open-ended. 
 Really? 
 I'm sorry, John. 
 I should have 
 phoned you 
 and let you know 
 that I was coming. 
 Yeah, well. 
 It's good to see you. 
 ( door opening and closing ) 
 Sanitation guys found 
 him in a dumpster. 
 Minimally responsive 
 to deep pain 
 thready pulse 
 in the 50s. 
 You sure 
 he's not dead? 
 He's still 
 moving air. 
 Barely. 
 Abby, can you 
 bring this guy in? 
 I haven't even 
 clocked in yet. 
 I know, but you 
 have a coat on. 
 Hey, I know this guy. 
 Oh, man! 
 Is this great, 
 or what? 
 Empty chairs, empty racks. 
 Nothing like sub-arctic 
 temperatures 
 to keep the freaks 
 at home. 
 Yeah, except 
 it's freezing in here. 
 Maintenance is 
 checking the furnace. 
 This is what we get for punching 
 holes in the ozone layer. 
 Uh, isn't the 
 greenhouse effect 
 supposed to 
 make it warmer? 
 Greenhouse effect, 
 my ass. 
 It's 40 below 
 out there. 
 What's this? 
 This is 
 Icicle Andy. 
 You want him, 
 he's yours. 
 I thought he froze 
 to death last year. 
 The Iceman 
 cometh back. 
 Okay, 
 Trauma One's open. 
 Get his core temp 
 pump in some 
 warm saline 
 and throw a heating 
 blanket on him. 
 Oh, I'd keep that on 
 if I were you. 
 He's bradying down. 
 No, look, 
 now it's a-fib. 
 Sounds like rhonchi 
 on the right. 
 Probably pneumonia. 
 I think he's decreased 
 on the left. 
 Do you want to put in 
 a chest tube? 
 Uh, not if 
 I can help it. 
 This guy's got 
 bad vascular disease. 
 We'll never get 
 a line in him. 
 Fine, 
 prep for lavage. 
 Oh, man, look at 
 this dude's hands. 
 Ew. 
 Can you get 
 a pulse ox? 
 I don't know. 
 Can barely get the monitor... 
 ( groan ) 
 What's wrong? 
 It snapped off. 
 Ah, he gave you the 
 finger, huh, Abby? 
 Can they reattach that? 
 Not without superglue. 
 Okay, let's get 
 a central line kit, 
 betadine and some 
 warm blankets 
 to start. 
 No, you can't 
 come in here. 
 You have to go back. 
 Where's my mom? 
 She's not in here. 
 Yes, she was. 
 You got this? 
 Yeah. 
 You lost your mom? 
 It's not one of these 
 two ladies right here? 
 She was in there. 
 Okay, well, maybe 
 she's all finished. 
 Do you want to see 
 if we can find her? 
 I'm Abby. 
 What's your name? 
 Douglas. 
 Douglas what? 
 Douglas Leeman. 
 Okay, Douglas, 
 right this way. 
 What's your mom's name? 
 B. 
 B? 
 Is that short 
 for Beatrice? 
 Barbara? 
 Betty? 
 Just B. 
 Just B, okay. 
 Abby, can you 
 help me? 
 Uh, sure. 
 Frank, this is 
 Douglas Leeman. 
 He's lost his mom. 
 This is Frank. 
 He's very good 
 at finding people's moms. 
 Douglas, you like 
 doughnuts? 
 When did the 
 chest pains start? 
 This morning. 
 But I've been 
 feeling crappy for... 
 a couple of days. 
 I thought it was just a cold 
 or maybe the flu. 
 Bibasilar rales. 
 Have you experienced 
 any shortness of breath? 
 Yeah. 
 I thought I'd step outside, 
 catch a breath of fresh air. 
 I got so dizzy 
 I fainted. 
 Three plus pitting edema 
 on both feet. 
 Have you ever had anything 
 like this before? 
 Never. 
 Do you have 
 a heart condition? 
 No. 
 Are you on 
 birth control pills? 
 No, I'm trying 
 to get pregnant. 
 I've been taking 
 fertility dr*gs. 
 FSH. 
 For how long? 
 Um... what's today? 
 Uh, the tenth. 
 Yeah, then 
 I'm on my tenth. 
 All right. 
 Let's get a CBC 
 chem-20, a DIC panel, 
 and a d-dimer. 
 Am I having some 
 sort of reaction 
 to the dr*gs? 
 It's possible 
 but we need to run 
 some more tests 
 to know for sure. 
 You've got fluid 
 in your lungs 
 which could be 
 a sign of a blood clot. 
 A blood clot? 
 It's unlikely, but I 
 just want to make sure. 
 It could be a possible side 
 effect of the medication. 
 Let's do 
 a doppler. 
 I'll be back. 
 Do you want me 
 to call your husband? 
 I'm not married. 
 Oh, boyfriend? 
 I decided to have 
 a baby on my own. 
 Got tired of waiting 
 around for Mr. Right. 
 I know that story. 
 Chest x-ray 
 and an EKG? 
 Yeah. 
 And set her up 
 for a VQ. 
 Haven't seen you 
 around lately. 
 I've been working nights. 
 How was 
 your Christmas? 
 Quiet. 
 What'd you do 
 for New Year's? 
 I worked. 
 That's always fun. 
 Did you make 
 any resolutions? 
 Uh, I'm going 
 to help out more. 
 Help out more where? 
 Here? 
 Uh, no, Europe. 
 I've, uh, volunteered 
 to go to Bosnia 
 for two months with 
 Doctors Without Borders. 
 Bosnia? 
 Yeah, I speak 
 the language. 
 What brought this on? 
 I don't know. 
 Change of scenery. 
 FRANK: 
 Good, huh? 
 Hey, nice hat, 
 Snoop. 
 Hey, Frank, I thought you said 
 you were going to get 
 the heat turned up. 
 They're working on it. 
 Oh, really? 
 Is that why the thermostat 
 in the lounge says 56? 
 Get used to it. 
 We're heading into 
 another ice age 
 like the one that 
 k*lled the dinosaurs. 
 Cold didn't k*ll 
 the dinosaurs, Frank. 
 Cholesterol did. 
 Mr. Ellis in Curtain 
 Three can go home. 
 Miss Renfrew in Four 
 needs to be admitted. 
 Got a minute? 
 Uh, no, not really. 
 I hope your day's 
 shaping up 
 better than mine. 
 Doubt it. 
 I was picking up Rachel's 
 laundry after you left 
 and this fell out 
 of her jeans. 
 She's smoking. 
 I don't think she uses it 
 to light campfires. 
 What are you 
 going to do? 
 I don't know. 
 Did you find anything 
 else in her pockets? 
 No. 
 Mark, what if it's 
 not cigarettes? 
 Her boyfriend tested 
 positive for marijuana. 
 Ex-boyfriend. 
 I should search her room. 
 You think that's wise? 
 Well, if she's doing dr*gs, 
 I want to know about it. 
 You know, asking her 
 doesn't guarantee 
 I'm going 
 to get the truth. 
 Yeah, but searching her room-- 
 that's such a violation 
 of her privacy. 
 You suggested that I r*fle 
 through her pockets. 
 In the course of doing laundry. 
 HALEH: 
 Dr. Greene. 
 EMT: 
 Ian Nevinger, 29, 
 burned in a garage... 
 We'll talk about this. 
 Looks like 
 some fumes ignited. 
 Ha, this is adorable. 
 Don't you think? 
 It's pretty cute. 
 You want to buy it? 
 No, they won't let me 
 send him any gifts. 
 He must be getting 
 pretty big now, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, they sent 
 a video of him walking 
 just before Christmas. 
 It won't be long now 
 before he's asking to borrow 
 the keys to the car. 
 ( chuckling ) 
 ( sighing ) 
 You know, I'm starting to wonder 
 if I'm making 
 any right decisions lately. 
 Eh, it's mid-year. 
 Something will open up 
 by the spring. 
 Yeah, well, maybe they'll 
 open back up at County. 
 Hey, cool. 
 Have you seen these? 
 These are really neat. 
 John, um... 
 What would you say 
 if I told you 
 I asked the waitress 
 at Doc Magoo's 
 if she remembered 
 Weaver being paged 
 the night we lost 
 the Marfan case? 
 I'd say that place is 
 full of people with pagers. 
 I know. 
 I was desperate. 
 So, what, 
 she didn't remember? 
 Not about 
 Weaver getting paged. 
 But she remembers 
 Weaver coming back in 
 looking for 
 her pager 
 and finding it 
 in the bathroom. 
 She couldn't answer 
 my page, John 
 because she didn't 
 have her pager. 
 Are you sure? 
 I believe it. 
 Don't you? 
 Yeah, that explains it. 
 What are you going to do? 
 He die? 
 Yup. 
 Did you know him? 
 Only as Icicle Andy. 
 I think he was 
 a Vietnam vet. 
 I heard bums are reincarnated 
 as pigeons when they die. 
 Really? 
 I think it's 
 the other way around. 
 Check it out. 
 Tickets to tonight's 
 Blackhawks game. 
 And they're 
 good seats, too. 
 Whoa. 
 Where'd he get those? 
 Any ID? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Just two dollars, 
 some change and matches. 
 Are you going 
 to keep the tickets? 
 No. 
 Can I have them? 
 No. 
 Why not? 
 I think it's called 
 grave-robbing. 
 He ain't using them. 
 Well, somebody might 
 come to claim the body. 
 ( laughing ) 
 I'm serious. 
 Yeah, right. 
 Seriously, 
 I need them. 
 No. 
 Look, the tickets are 
 only for tonight, Abby. 
 Ain't nobody coming 
 for this guy. 
 Forget it. 
 Oh, come on, Abby. 
 Abby, look, 
 he's straight-up dead. 
 Abby, can you take a look 
 at something? 
 What patient? 
 Uh, Mr. Paninski-- 
 unstable angina. 
 I called CCU. 
 I just wanted to make sure 
 I didn't miss anything. 
 Did you do a rectal? 
 No. 
 You better. 
 Because... 
 Because if his stool 
 is heme-positive... 
 The heparin, right. 
 Thank you. 
 Frank? 
 Yeah? 
 You said you were going 
 to find his mother. 
 I tried. 
 No B. Leeman 
 checked in today. 
 I'm beginning to think 
 somebody dumped him. 
 He said his mother 
 was in Trauma One 
 with a headache. 
 Can you double-check it 
 with the admit log? 
 Sure. 
 MAN: 
 Abby. 
 Hi. 
 Richard. 
 How's it going? 
 What are you doing here? 
 It's colder in here 
 than it is outside. 
 You look great. 
 ( chuckling ) 
 So, how are things? 
 They're good. 
 Good. That's good. 
 You seeing anyone or... 
 Oh, yeah. 
 I'm breaking hearts 
 all over town. 
 What do you want, X? 
 X? 
 Yeah. 
 Can I call you X? 
 'Cause it's almost 
 like sexy 
 so people might think 
 it's short for ecstasy 
 or triple-X 
 which stands 
 for porn, uh, now 
 except for in cartoons 
 where it stands for poison 
 which I always thought 
 was funny, but... 
 What do you want? 
 Oh, look, I, um... 
 Well, I wanted to talk 
 to you in person 
 so you didn't hear this 
 through the grapevine. 
 Oh, my God. 
 What? 
 Are you going to jail? 
 No. 
 Uh... 
 I'm getting married. 
 ( chuckling ) 
 Married. 
 Yeah. 
 You'd think I would have 
 learned my lesson. 
 I'm glad one of us did. 
 What is she, rich? 
 Hardly. She's a teacher. 
 Not that one you had 
 at the museum. 
 No, no... no. 
 Her name's Corrine. 
 She's, uh, 
 she's really great. 
 She's really down to earth. 
 I think you 
 might even like her. 
 How old is she? 
 She's 34. 
 She has 
 a six-year-old son, Adam. 
 Really great kid. 
 You're going 
 to be a father? 
 Stepfather, yeah. 
 It's kind of 
 hard to believe, huh? 
 Yeah, uh... 
 Instant family. 
 I always wanted kids, so... 
 Since when? 
 Uh, you know, just a while. 
 I guess we just never talked 
 about it, you know? 
 And you, uh, felt 
 that today was the day 
 you had to tell me 
 about all this? 
 Is today a bad day? 
 Nope. 
 Um... so, what? 
 Am I supposed to 
 give you my blessing? 
 That's up to you. 
 Well, I have to get 
 back to work. 
 Richard. 
 I hope 
 that it works out this time. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, Aspen's great. 
 Mm. 
 There's three 
 separate mountains 
 so you don't have 
 to be an expert. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 What is that? 
 What? 
 I don't know. 
 Yeah, they've got runs 
 for every level. 
 Is that your jaw? 
 What? 
 That click, click, 
 click sound. 
 Oh, my God. 
 You can hear that? 
 Yeah. 
 I can't help it. 
 I think I have this 
 TMJ happening thing. 
 Here, chew. 
 No. 
 Come on. Just chew 
 so I can hear it. 
 No! 
 LEWIS ( giggling ): 
 Get out of here. 
 I'm going to get 
 back to work. 
 I'm going 
 to take care of this. 
 You should see a dentist 
 about that jaw. 
 Yeah, either that 
 or you should find someone else 
 to eat lunch with. 
 I'm sorry about that. 
 What? 
 I should have 
 said something to you sooner. 
 It just sort of snuck up on me. 
 I hate it when that happens. 
 Yeah. 
 It's really more about 
 friendship than anything else. 
 Really? 
 ( slams locker door ) 
 Abby... 
 Don't sweat it, Carter. 
 Where's Frank? 
 Hey, Douglas. 
 Did you find your mom? 
 Are you getting hungry? 
 Yeah. 
 Would you like 
 to eat pizza? 
 A hamburger? 
 My mom says fast food 
 isn't good for you. 
 Well... she's right 
 but the fast food we serve 
 here at the hospital 
 is specially formulated 
 to be nutritious. 
 So would you like 
 some French fries? 
 Okay. 
 Sit tight. 
 Frank! 
 I'm working on it. 
 Well, work harder. 
 He's been here for 
 a couple of hours. 
 If I find his mom, 
 can I have the hockey tickets 
 you pinched 
 off that stiff? 
 No. 
 Has anyone seen 
 Dr. Kovac? 
 What do you need? 
 Mrs. Stipes' pressure's down. 
 Frank, find Luka. 
 What happened? 
 She got dizzy. 
 Systolic's at 80. 
 I opened up 
 the saline. 
 How you doing, Merril? 
 GALLANT: 
 Is it a PE? 
 I don't know. 
 Crank her oxygen up to 15 liters 
 and grab some dopamine 
 off the crash cart. 
 She's got muffled heart sounds 
 and JVD. 
 Malik, we need 
 a pericardiocentesis tray 
 and a sonosite. 
 Okay. 
 Pressure's down to 70. 
 You think it's tamponade? 
 Unless you got 
 any better ideas. 
 What happened? 
 Hypotensive 
 signs of 
 pericardial infusion. 
 You thought she had a clot 
 from hyperstimulation? 
 You can third space 
 anywhere, even 
 around the heart. 
 There it is. 
 Here you go, Abby. 
 Okay, glove up. 
 You can assist. 
 Lidocaine's ready. 
 Abby, I think I found 
 that kid's mom 
 if she doesn't have 
 the same last name as him. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 Okay, hook up the 
 alligator clip. 
 Belinda Matheson, she 
 came in last night 
 with a headache. 
 Turned out to 
 be a brain bleed. 
 Insert subxyphoid, 
 45-degree angle. 
 Last night? 
 Yeah, they admitted 
 her to neurosurg. 
 Watch for injury current. 
 I can't believe 
 that little boy sat 
 in Chairs all night, 
 and nobody noticed. 
 There it is. 
 Can you take him upstairs 
 to his mother? 
 Uh, that could 
 be difficult. 
 She's dead. 
 What? 
 Blood pressure's back up to 90. 
 She stroked out 
 a few hours ago. 
 KOVAC: 
 Second syringe. 
 What do you 
 want me to do? 
 Abby? 
 Um, well, just try 
 to find his dad. 
 Systolic's 110. 
 And get him some French fries. 
 KOVAC: 
 Okay. 
 Good pickup. 
 ABBY: 
 Did you get in touch 
 with the father? 
 He said he lives 
 in Los Angeles. 
 He doesn't know 
 the number. 
 It wasn't in here? 
 I couldn't find it. 
 Did you call his school? 
 No. 
 Well, I'm sure they have 
 a number, Frank. 
 I thought 
 you used to be a cop. 
 I was. 
 Well, act like a cop. 
 Track the guy down. 
 Did someone from 
 neurosurg come down 
 and talk to him? 
 Not yet. 
 Which ER doc 
 treated his mother? 
 Weaver. She's working 
 a half shift today, 
 so she's not in yet. 
 Do you want me to page 
 somebody from neurosurg? 
 I don't know. I think 
 somebody should come down 
 and tell the little boy 
 his mother died. 
 No, she didn't. 
 Douglas, I need to talk to you 
 about your mom's headache, okay? 
 Let's sit down. 
 All right, um... 
 It was pretty bad. 
 Um... it was caused by 
 a blood vessel 
 in her brain 
 that... ruptured. 
 It broke 
 and the doctors 
 tried really hard 
 but they couldn't fix it. 
 Can she go home now? 
 No, Douglas, I'm sorry. 
 She died. 
 My mom has a headache. 
 She's not sick. 
 I want to see her. 
 Where is she? 
 Douglas? 
 Mom! Mom! 
 Douglas! 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Mom, where are you? 
 Douglas... 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Douglas... 
 Mom! 
 Mom! 
 Douglas. 
 She's dead. 
 Stop saying that. 
 Why do you keep 
 saying that? 
 I know it's hard 
 for you to understand. 
 I want my mom. 
 I know you do. 
 I just want my mom. 
 ( sobbing ) 
 Shh. 
 Shh, it's okay. 
 FRANK: 
 He finally went down? 
 ABBY: 
 He's exhausted. 
 Poor kid. 
 I finally got 
 a hold of his dad. 
 He's in Australia 
 on a business trip. 
 Australia? 
 The soonest flight he 
 can get is a redeye 
 tomorrow night. 
 So, Social Services are going 
 to have to take him till then? 
 Sorry. I'll call them. 
 That's all right. 
 I'll do it. Thanks. 
 Can you grab me 
 the minute he gets up? 
 Sure. 
 Abby, do we do psychiatric 
 transfers to other hospitals? 
 What? 
 I have a patient 
 in Curtain Three. 
 He was admitted with 
 a tiny scalp lac 
 from a slip-and-fall. 
 And he's insisting 
 he be moved out 
 of Curtain Three 
 and he wants me to call 
 his caseworker from 
 some private hospital. 
 Is he altered 
 from the fall? 
 No, but he seems 
 pretty agitated. 
 Did you... get 
 a psych consult? 
 Not yet. 
 It probably wouldn't hurt. 
 The paramedics brought me 
 to this hospital. 
 I didn't want to come here. 
 Can you just please call 
 my caseworker 
 and move me to 
 another room? 
 SOBRIKI: 
 You don't have 
 to do that. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 It's just 
 a precaution. 
 What happened? 
 I slipped. That's all. 
 Is this 
 your patient? 
 Yeah. I saw him 
 in the hallway. 
 Brief LOC after he slipped 
 on some ice. 
 History of migraine. 
 That's not his only history. 
 What's with the restraints? 
 I don't want 
 to cause any trouble. 
 Just, please, just 
 call my caseworker. 
 We will. Dr. Lewis. 
 Can you please just get me 
 out of this room? 
 Don't worry. We'll move you. 
 What kind of caseworker? 
 SOBRIKI: 
 Psychiatric. 
 He's monitoring my 
 conditional release. 
 He has the card. 
 Release from where? 
 Dr. Lewis, now. 
 Okay, two of IV Ativan 
 five of Compazine, 
 and a trauma panel. 
 He's schizophrenic. 
 He's been here before? 
 He stabbed Carter and 
 k*lled a med student 
 two years ago. 
 Him? 
 Yeah. 
 He stabbed Carter? 
 Yes. 
 What's he doing out? 
 I don't know. The police 
 are on their way 
 but I think we 
 should transfer him 
 before Carter sees him. 
 No. I need to get a CT. 
 He can get a CT at Mercy. 
 He has a head injury... 
 He stabbed two people 
 in that room... 
 ...loss of consciousness, 
 vomiting... 
 And k*lled one of them. 
 I'm not transferring 
 a man at risk for 
 an intracranial bleed. 
 I don't care 
 what he did. 
 Am I calling this 
 psychiatrist or not? 
 No. I'll call him. 
 We'll find out his status, 
 we'll get the CT 
 and then we'll take it 
 from there, okay? 
 Abby, the morgue called. 
 They're ready for you. 
 Move him 
 to the Suture Room 
 close the blinds, 
 and don't let 
 I got it. 
 Dr. Carter see him. 
 And get his name 
 off the board. 
 She looks like Snow White. 
 Hi... 
 Mom. 
 I drew you a picture. 
 ( whispering ) 
 WEAVER: 
 You took him 
 to the morgue? 
 He didn't believe 
 his mother was dead. 
 Well, then 
 you call Psych. 
 Advice you might 
 have given yourself 
 18 hours ago. 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 She vagalled in Triage. 
 No one even told me 
 she had a kid with her. 
 Well, she did. 
 Not yet. 
 Why not? 
 Abby, why not? 
 Because we're trying to find 
 another family member. 
 Who's we? 
 Me. 
 That's not your job. 
 But I don't 
 want him 
 to go to another 
 strange place. 
 Their holding 
 facility 
 is a lot more 
 comforting 
 than the ER 
 or the morgue. 
 He'll just be passed 
 from one stranger 
 to another stranger. 
 They have 
 the personnel 
 and resources 
 to deal with it. 
 Call them now. 
 WOMAN: 
 ""You're honest, 
 forthright 
 ""and a judge... a good 
 judge of character. 
 ""You often ramble 
 incoherently when agitated. 
 Even your dog 
 doesn't like you."" 
 My dog died a year ago. 
 It's a joke, Frank. 
 This amuses you? 
 Carter, what's your sign? 
 Gemini, why? 
 Oh, horoscopes 
 from the Internet. 
 ""You're open to new ideas, 
 compassionate, a risk taker..."" 
 That's true. 
 ""You tend to overstay 
 your welcome at parties 
 and you often 
 smell like cheese."" 
 Don't you have 
 some work to do? 
 Abby, your turn. 
 No, thanks. 
 What's your sign? 
 Come on. 
 ""Out of Order."" 
 CARTER: 
 Who moved Libertique 
 out of the Suture Room? 
 The hand surgeon 
 is stuck in surgery 
 for the next 40 minutes, 
 and we needed the room 
 for an extensor 
 tendon repair. 
 Oh, I'll do that. 
 No, no, no. The-the... 
 surgical intern's got it. 
 Can you take 
 a look at this... 
 expl*sive 
 watery diarrhea? 
 You need to start an IV? 
 Maybe. I don't know. 
 He's... he's 
 pretty miserable. 
 She. 
 She. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. Mm-hmm. 
 Abby, the 
 light source 
 on the fiber-optic 
 is down. 
 Get me a spare. 
 Okay. 
 MAN: 
 Can I see a doctor 
 this century? 
 Hang on. 
 I hang on any longer, 
 I'll be dead. 
 If you're talking, 
 you're not dying. 
 He was found not guilty 
 by reason of insanity. 
 Shouldn't he be in 
 a state forensic hospital? 
 He was. He was. 
 He was stepped down 
 to a less 
 restrictive facility 
 about ten months ago 
 and now he's on 
 conditional release. 
 Bradying down with 60. 
 Mig of atropine. 
 I need that scope. 
 I've got it. 
 Pulse ox 78. 
 I need a smaller tube. 
 Number seven. Suction. 
 He's agitated. 
 He's nervous. 
 The guy's out 
 of board and care 
 less than a week 
 he hits his head 
 on some ice 
 and the paramedics 
 bring him here 
 of all places? 
 He got out in two years? 
 Who are you? 
 I was working 
 when he att*cked my friends. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He was a law student. 
 A professor there 
 got some colleagues 
 to do some 
 pro bono work. 
 They filed a writ 
 of habeas corpus 
 and won. 
 That's unbelievable. 
 But I can't say 
 I disagree. 
 Most schizophrenics 
 are nonviolent. 
 Well, this one was, wasn't he? 
 And when they are, 
 they rarely are twice. 
 He's not a danger 
 to himself or others. 
 Really. 
 Not on his meds. 
 There are safeguards 
 in place. 
 He needs to 
 be supervised 
 taking his medication 
 every day. 
 Did he get his head CT? 
 They're almost 
 ready for him. 
 Abby, can you 
 check this foley? 
 I think 
 it's overflowing. 
 Clamp it. 
 I did. 
 It's overflowing. 
 Just get him out of here. 
 Anyway, I want those 
 restraints removed. 
 Uh... no. 
 He is coherent 
 and lucid. 
 I have been 
 working with him 
 for over a year. 
 Abby. 
 No. 
 Susan, I swear to God 
 if you take off 
 those restraints... 
 You keep 
 somebody posted 
 outside his door. 
 He needs 
 reassurance and 
 respect right now. 
 Respect? 
 Yes! 
 I'm sorry. 
 He needs our respect? 
 Abby, go. 
 Looks like over a liter 
 in the last hour. 
 BP's 110/70 
 and her sats are up. 
 Good. You need 
 to send out her 
 repeat potassium. 
 Right. 
 Thanks. 
 He said something 
 about the ICU. 
 Yeah, maybe for 
 a couple of days 
 just for safety. 
 It's the fertility dr*gs, 
 isn't it 
 that's doing this to me? 
 The doctor has 
 to review your labs. 
 I could try to find 
 him now, if you like. 
 I'm sorry. It just... 
 It must be the damn hormones. 
 I'm not usually a crier. 
 It's okay. 
 Thanks. 
 Sometimes being a woman 
 sucks, you know? 
 ( sighing ): 
 It has its moments. 
 You grow up praying 
 you don't get pregnant 
 every time you have sex. 
 And then, when you finally do 
 want to have a baby, you can't. 
 It's so unfair. 
 You been trying 
 for a long time? 
 I just keep thinking 
 that maybe I had my chance 
 and I blew it. 
 You don't know that. 
 No, I've been pregnant. 
 A few years ago. 
 It was an accident. 
 I had just started a new job 
 and this new relationship. 
 It didn't seem 
 like the right time. 
 It happens. 
 I only waited till I was ready 
 so that I could be 
 the best mother I could be. 
 I'm sure you're going to be. 
 Unless I waited too long. 
 ( sighing ) 
 Weaver's 
 looking for you. 
 What? 
 She wants to know 
 why you didn't call 
 Family Services 
 on that boy. 
 I am. I will. 
 The on-call social worker 
 for the ER, please. 
 Did someone 
 claim them? 
 What? 
 The tickets. 
 Oh. No. 
 Lewis was asking for one. 
 Mmm! 
 Thank you! 
 No, just have him paged. Thanks. 
 Abby, when you get 
 a chance, I need 
 a thick-and-thin 
 smear 
 and a culture 
 in Curtain Three. 
 And your diarrhea patient 
 was heme-negative. 
 Just a little 
 PO-challenged. 
 I sent him home 
 with some Immodium. 
 Carter, I have 
 a five-year-old 
 with abdominal pain 
 and I'm worried 
 about intussusception. 
 Is there any blood 
 in the stool? 
 No, but he had a... 
 a palpable mass. 
 SOBRIKI: 
 Hey, sweetheart. 
 WOMAN: 
 Here's Daddy. 
 SOBRIKI: 
 Hey... mmm! Hey. Hi. 
 I'm okay. I'm okay. 
 Daddy slipped 
 and fell 
 and he hit his head 
 but I'm okay. 
 WOMAN: 
 They put you 
 in restraints? 
 Yeah. It's just 
 a precaution. 
 They're 
 a little paranoid. 
 Oh, it's you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What happened? 
 What's he doing here? 
 He slipped and fell 
 outside his 
 office building. 
 His office building? 
 He's on conditional 
 release. 
 You're out. 
 I'm better. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That wasn't me who 
 did that to you... 
 ...to your friend. 
 You know that, right? 
 You're a doctor. 
 You know it's a disease. 
 I'm being treated. 
 I'm okay now. 
 Great. 
 I'm glad you're okay. 
 Whoo. 
 ( vomiting ) 
 I'm starting to get it. 
 Although that little puck 
 is hard to keep track of. 
 They should give it a color 
 so your eye can follow it. 
 What, the puck? 
 Yes, I mean, 
 like bright pink or red 
 or flashing lights 
 or something like that. 
 Okay, a flashing 
 pink puck. 
 ( laughing ): 
 Why not? 
 'Cause it's hockey. 
 I love the Hawks. 
 You got the tickets? 
 MALIK: 
 You got the tickets. 
 LEWIS: 
 You have the tickets! 
 Hey, what's wrong? 
 Uh, nothing. 
 I hugged him. 
 You what? 
 Oh, yeah, I'm the Bruce Lee 
 of love, girl! 
 ( laughing ) 
 Maybe I just need 
 some fresh air. 
 Ho ho... 
 Wait a minute. 
 You're not out? 
 Huh? Who are 
 you hiding from? 
 I'm not hiding. 
 Then what the heck 
 was that? 
 You don't want your friends 
 to see us together? 
 They're not my friends. 
 They work for me. 
 How do you think 
 that makes me feel? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You came on to me. 
 You are not out. 
 I am not out at work... 
 Well, you need to be. 
 Sandy... 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't got time for this. 
 Okay... Okay. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 He'll be here tomorrow. 
 Great. 
 Have you ever been 
 to Los Angeles? 
 Once. 
 Disneyland. 
 Oh. 
 I think you'll like it there 
 because it's sunny. 
 Not cold like it is here. 
 Excuse me. 
 Can you give this 
 to Dr. Carter? 
 I think 
 you'd better do that. 
 Well, they're 
 discharging Paul. 
 I have to drive him home. 
 They wouldn't 
 have released him 
 if he weren't better. 
 He's taking 
 his meds. 
 He's in therapy. 
 He has a disease 
 but it's being treated. 
 I mean, that's 
 what you do here. 
 You treat disease 
 so people can try 
 to move on with life. 
 Yep. 
 He's my husband. 
 We're his family. 
 I can't give up on him. 
 Good luck. 
 Hey. 
 Um, Lewis 
 discharged Sobriki 
 and his wife asked me 
 to give you this. 
 Guess you couldn't protect me 
 from her either, huh? 
 Uh, yeah, I'm sorry 
 about that. 
 I just, I... 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Forget it. 
 Are you off already? 
 Half shift. 
 I'm off in a half hour 
 if you want to get 
 something to eat. 
 I should get home. 
 Or maybe just... 
 coffee and pie? 
 I had a pretty 
 crappy day myself. 
 Gammie just got out 
 of the convalescent hospital. 
 I should go home 
 and check on her. 
 Are you going 
 to be okay? 
 Yeah, 
 I'm going to be fine. 
 Thank you for asking. 
 Any time. 
 No! 
 I have a real nice place 
 for you to stay... 
 No, I want 
 to stay here! 
 You can't, Douglas. 
 Abby! 
 I want to stay here... 
 But this is a hospital. 
 And you have 
 to go someplace 
 where you can get 
 some sleep. 
 No! 
 And get something 
 to eat 
 and maybe take a bath. 
 I'll stay with you! 
 Douglas, I don't... 
 No! 
 I don't stay here all the time, 
 honey 
 but you can come 
 visit me 
 whenever you want, okay? 
 I promise. 
 No! 
 I've got you. 
 Abby! 
 WOMAN: 
 Come on. 
 DOUGLAS: 
 Abby! 
 WOMAN: 
 We'll get you 
 some ice cream. 
 You'll be fine, Douglas. 
 Wait! I'll stay with you! 
 Abby! 
 Please! 
 Abby! 
 ( door closing ) 
 Abby, my cellulitis 
 patient is allergic 
 to penicillin... 
 No. 
 Can you give 
 IV erythromycin? 
 No. 
 What about 
 vancomycin? 
 No! I'm not 
 your attending. 
 I'm not a resident. 
 I'm a nurse. 
 You want me 
 to assess a patient 
 you want me to push meds 
 you want me 
 to check vitals 
 explain a situation 
 to a family member 
 that's fine. 
 What I will not do 
 is carry you through med school. 
 You want to be a doctor? 
 Start acting like one. 
 Rachel, can I talk to you? 
 RACHEL: 
 What are you 
 doing? 
 I was picking your stuff up. 
 You're searching my room. 
 It's a pigsty. 
 That doesn't give you the right 
 to go through 
 my things. 
 You mean these things? 
 I can't believe you did this! 
 Are you smoking now? 
 I asked you 
 a question. 
 Hey, Rachel! 
 Are these 
 your cigarettes? 
 I bought that pack like 
 a month ago on a dare. 
 To see if I could pass 
 for 18. 
 And the condoms? 
 What kind of a dare 
 is that? 
 They gave those out 
 in health class. 
 And you decided 
 to keep them? 
 You'd rather 
 I not have them? 
 You need to stop lying. 
 You don't 
 believe me anyway. 
 You go through 
 my private things. 
 I was looking 
 for dr*gs. 
 You said 
 you were picking up! 
 Who's lying now? 
 You're right. 
 The truth is I was 
 searching your room 
 because I don't know 
 if I can trust you. 
 Then fine! 
 Believe 
 whatever you want. 
 I'm smoking! I'm on dr*gs! 
 I'm having sex! 
 Lots of sex 
 with lots of guys 
 because I'm the school slut. 
 Are you happy? 
 ( door slamming ) 
 Yes, this is John Carter. 
 I have a private duty nurse 
 for my grandmother 
 who was supposed to start today. 
 She's not here. 
 Yeah. 
 ELEANOR: 
 I sent her home early. 
 What? 
 She was aggravating 
 Millicent 
 so I sent her 
 home early. 
 She'll be back 
 at 6:00 a.m. 
 It's a 24-hour service. 
 I'll get up... 
 if there's a problem. 
 What are you doing? 
 Pardon? 
 I mean, you show up 
 unannounced, uninvited... 
 Uninvited? 
 And now you're making 
 health care decisions? 
 Your grandmother asked me 
 to ask her to leave. 
 I was trying 
 to be helpful. 
 Well, do me a favor. 
 Don't try to be helpful. 
 It's not one 
 of your strong suits. 
 Excuse me, John. 
 I've had enough abuse 
 from my mother-in-law 
 today. 
 I don't need any more 
 from my son. 
 I'm sorry? 
 I'm sorry 
 but I have helped Gamma 
 through this. 
 I have tended 
 to her medical needs. 
 I have made 
 her health care arrangements. 
 So you need 
 to consult with me 
 before you do anything 
 like this. 
 Fine. 
 Call them back. 
 Yeah, you bet I will. 
 But I'm not leaving 
 this house. 
 And I don't care 
 if I'm uninvited. 
 I'm not going 
 to let your father 
 break up this family. 
 Family, huh? 
 What family would that be? 
 Don't be sarcastic. 
 You checked out 
 of this family 
 20 years ago. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 No. I'm not going 
 to let you put 
 some kind of revisionist spin 
 on this 
 with you as 
 the injured party, no. 
 Step aside... 
 No, I got stabbed! 
 I got stabbed in the back! 
 Where the hell were you? 
 You were in the same place 
 you've been my entire life. 
 You were someplace else. 
 We came back. 
 Three weeks later. 
 We were stuck in Tokyo 
 and you said 
 you were fine. 
 Well, I wasn't fine 
 and it wasn't okay. 
 Are you going to blame me 
 for taking dr*gs? 
 No, I am blaming you 
 for not being my mother! 
 Bobby died. 
 And I lost a mother. 
 May I go to bed now? 
 Yeah, run away... 
 ( sniffling ) 
 Oh... Oh, God! 
 Thank you. 
 We've got to call the super 
 about that, too. 
 It gets stuck 
 in the cold. 
 And I'm guessing 
 it's going to stay cold 
 for a while. 
 Hopefully not this cold. 
 Good. 
 I told Brian 
 January wasn't the best time 
 to move 
 but that's when 
 the semester starts. 
 He's in law school. 
 Did you get locked out? 
 We had a fight. 
 So I went 
 to the store. 
 Another half hour, 
 he'll be asleep. 
 Are you from Chicago? 
 For a while now, yeah. 
 Originally? 
 Minnesota. You? 
 Idaho. The potato part, 
 not the white supremacist part. 
 You want a beer? 
 No, thanks. 
 Come on. Have a seat. 
 You look like you've had 
 a long day. 
 Thank you. 
 Mmm, you got a card. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 It's nice to get 
 one personal piece of mail 
 mixed in with all 
 the bills and junk. 
 Your birthday? 
 Huh? 
 Is it your birthday? 
 Yes. 
 ( chuckling ) 
 Today? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 8:03 p.m. 
 Well, congratulations. 
 You've made it. 
 Happy birthday.

er_9_18,108757,9,18,"Previously on ER: 
 I'll take him up myself. 
 Dr. Romano, your arm. 
 Damn it! 
 I'm fine. 
 Let's just, let's go. 
 Let's roll. 
 We're going to Las Vegas 
 tonight. 
 Are you ready? 
 I've asked Robert 
 to consider 
 sharing the Chief of Staff 
 position with you. 
 I'd rather cut 
 off my good arm. 
 Fine. Congratulations, Kerry. 
 You've just become 
 Chief of Staff. 
 That was a gift. 
 From a grateful patient? 
 Grateful girlfriend. 
 I have a few meetings with 
 department heads later. 
 Otherwise, I 
 would have waited. 
 Oh, yeah, of course. 
 I'll have all this 
 sent to your home 
 by week's end. 
 Dr. Weaver? 
 Yeah. 
 Maintenance is here. 
 Send them in. 
 What happened 
 to Brenda? 
 We had to let her go. 
 She seemed unwilling 
 to make the transition. 
 Centered, right 
 above the backs 
 of the chairs, 
 and at museum level. 
 I always hated 
 the Impressionists. 
 Look, it's a 
 lateral move, Robert. 
 All that sugar-coating 
 of the truth. 
 Believe me, it 
 wasn't my idea. 
 Dr. Anspaugh thought 
 it might be a 
 good interim step. 
 That's strange, because 
 this little power play 
 smacks of a certain 
 estrogen-based malice 
 I've grown 
 all too familiar with 
 over the years. 
 You know... I really 
 wish you'd try to 
 appreciate the fact 
 that we're trying to 
 do you a favor here. 
 What you're doing 
 is bending me over 
 and driving it 
 up the chocolate highway-- 
 let's be honest. 
 You're a one-handed 
 surgeon, Robert, 
 not to mention a human 
 resources nightmare, 
 and a lousy 
 administrator 
 who's burned more bridges 
 than you've ever built. 
 You're lucky to 
 have options at all. 
 Oh, you're suggesting 
 I have some. 
 Yes, you do; you have three. 
 It's this, it's teaching 
 or it's out. 
 Could I get your 
 home address...? 
 Bite me, Nancy. 
 Dr. Romano, I have 
 some billing give-backs 
 from Anesthesiology. 
 Not my job. 
 Cardio Admin's 
 on line one for you. 
 Take a message. 
 Well, what 
 do I tell them? 
 That I don't work here anymore. 
 ( door opens ) 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm taking Mrs. Tucker to X ray. 
 That's what 
 orderlies are for. 
 Park Granny and go help someone 
 drain an abscess. 
 Yeah, but I got... 
 You're a med student. 
 You're not doing scut, 
 you're not doing squat. 
 Hey, Green Card, I want all your 
 performance evals by day's end. 
 Why? 
 I want something to read 
 when I'm on the can. 
 Why do you think, Igor? 
 You're on my hit list. 
 Who supplies 
 the nurses' scrubs? 
 Allied. 
 Switch to Lindeman's. 
 They hug booty better. 
 What the hell are 
 you looking at? 
 Oh, hey, hey, hey, everybody! 
 Great news-- 
 pinata out in the parking lot. 
 Andale, andale. 
 They're here for 
 one of their kids. 
 Yeah? Well, they need 
 to stop having kids. 
 Clear them out 
 or you're fired. 
 What?! 
 Let me rephrase that; 
 you're fired. 
 You can't fire 
 nurses. 
 I just did. 
 Hey, pituitary boy. 
 You talking 
 to me? 
 Yeah, I lost my arm, 
 not my olfactory nerve. 
 Sic Security on the bum 
 taking a crap over there, 
 and get me a list 
 of every staff member's salary, 
 including yours. 
 What was that 
 all about? 
 Meet the new boss. 
 And get rid of 
 this coffee machine in here! 
 You losers can pay 
 for your own java! 
 Oh! At times 
 like this, 
 I wish I practiced 
 in Florida. 
 No, it's too humid. 
 Plus, you'd miss me. 
 Huh, well, I wouldn't 
 miss the wind chill. 
 Hey, Dr. Chen, 
 how many candles? 
 Hey, I said no cake. 
 Happy birthday, 
 Jing-Mei. 
 Like you even knew. 
 Yes, I did. 
 Uh-huh. 
 And I got you something. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And I figured if you 
 weren't busy later, 
 I would take you 
 over to the Grotto, 
 and maybe we'd get some 
 champagne afterwards. 
 Ooh, you thought this through, 
 didn't you? 
 Yes, indeed; 
 why wouldn't I? 
 How you doing? 
 CDs, jewelry 
 and personal accessories, 
 all at discount rates. 
 Uh, no, thanks. 
 Ladies love stuffed animals. 
 Five bucks 
 for this little cutie. 
 Don't make 
 me hurt you. 
 Hey, hey, 
 this is America. 
 If you can't sell crap 
 on the street, 
 we're not a free society. 
 Bye. 
 Come on, get 
 out of my way. 
 Okay, I should be back 
 by 6:00. 
 She woke up early. 
 So make sure she 
 takes a nap, okay? 
 Okay. Hey, you like 
 the sign I put up? 
 Yeah. It's, uh, sweet. 
 Okay, my darling, bye-bye. 
 Hey, kids love stuffed animals. 
 Five bucks 
 for this little cutie. 
 No, thank you. 
 Comes in pink. 
 You're scaring her. 
 I got dolls in here, too. 
 Go, go! 
 ( screaming ) 
 My foot! My foot! 
 Told Haleh she was fired. 
 Said it was a management tool. 
 Always fire someone 
 the first day. 
 Lets them know 
 who's boss. 
 He can call himself king 
 as long as I get severance. 
 Hey, Abby, can you park 
 Mrs. Strohm here in Exam One? 
 Uh, no. We lost 
 another exam room. 
 ( sighing ) 
 Go park her in the hall. 
 Weaver never had an office. 
 Said he'd take the lounge 
 if we're not careful. 
 And put our lockers where? 
 Triage? 
 Oh, that's great. 
 So, now our personal stuff 
 can get stolen, too. 
 Too late. 
 Brand new leather gloves 
 right out of my locker. 
 Real leather? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Animals died to make them. 
 Right, and we should all wear 
 canvas shoes. 
 Oh, God! 
 I could use 
 a little help here. 
 CARTER: 
 What happened? 
 Corday's nanny 
 ran over his foot. 
 With her freakin' minivan. 
 I'm crippled. 
 How did this become 
 your problem? 
 Elizabeth decided 
 that it was an E.R. case. 
 Yeah, it's typical. 
 We got any open beds? 
 ROMANO: 
 Yeah, if he's a 
 paying customer. 
 Otherwise, park him in the hall. 
 For anyone late 
 for his or her shift, 
 be advised 
 that I am now in charge 
 of this human cesspool. 
 Say good-bye to the warm fuzzies 
 of the Weaver era, 
 and hello 
 to the age of efficiency 
 and cost effectiveness. 
 Future tardiness will result 
 in a docked paycheck 
 and/or letter to file. 
 And once you do get to work 
 on time, 
 you will treat, you will street, 
 and you will do so 
 as quickly as humanly possible. 
 Any questions? 
 Didn't think so. 
 Medivac, two minutes out; 
 auto versus ped. 
 Kovac and Carter, 
 and keep dispositions 
 under 20 minutes. 
 Doctors Lewis, Chen and Pratt 
 can focus on clearing the board, 
 and you can get me 
 a breakfast burrito, 
 extra cheese, 
 hold the salsa. 
 Please? 
 Get your love at home. 
 Should be 
 interesting. 
 Romano in charge. 
 Seen any movies 
 lately? 
 Nope. 
 Tried that sushi place 
 at Navy Pier yet? 
 No. 
 It's good. 
 Long time now... 
 that you've been together. 
 Yeah, a year? 
 Almost. 
 That's nice. 
 Josh Rushing, 37. 
 Long way from County. 
 Busy day; we go 
 where they tell us. 
 Scalp lac, 
 multiple contusions. 
 Probable 
 hit-and-run. 
 He's suffering 
 from exposure. 
 He's been down 
 a while. Homeless? 
 After a couple 
 of days out, 
 everybody 
 looks homeless. 
 Is Susan Lewis 
 working today? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Jack-knifed rig on the Dan Ryan 
 with an SUV 
 trapped underneath. 
 Damn it, we got to go! 
 Okay, on my count-- 
 one, two, three. 
 CBC, lytes, bun, 
 creatinine, 
 and let's get an accu-check. 
 His wallet says he's 
 an accountant from Indiana. 
 What's he doing 
 walking the back 
 roads of Illinois? 
 Got a clavicle deformity 
 on the left. 
 Exercise? 18 in the right A.C. 
 with a liter up. 
 Accu-check is 96. 
 Not in loafers. 
 Pretty isolated 
 out that way. 
 Lucky they found him 
 at all. 
 All right, what have we got? 
 A possible car 
 versus pedestrian. 
 Vitals stable 
 but unresponsive. 
 This is why 
 I went to med school-- 
 so I could practice 
 veterinary medicine. 
 Sonosite. 
 Both lungs are up. 
 He doesn't need 
 a chest tube. 
 I'll be the judge of that. 
 Not in the middle 
 of a trauma. 
 Who is it? 
 It's a collect person-to-person 
 from Zagreb. 
 ROMANO: 
 No blood in 
 Morrison's... 
 Your dad? 
 No free fluid, 
 no pericardial 
 ...named Gordana. 
 effusion, nothing. 
 Catch. May I? 
 Hello. Don't ever call 
 this number again. 
 Why did you do that? 
 Hey, you want to chew the fat 
 with the peasants back home, 
 dial Ten-Ten-Call 
 the Third World. 
 Okay, c-spine, chest 
 and pelvis to start. 
 KOVAC: 
 He needs a rectal. 
 Oh, um, I took the liberty 
 of checking the union manual. 
 You can't fire nurses. 
 They have their own 
 administrative authority. 
 You have to lodge 
 a complaint with 
 the nurse manager. 
 Fine. Tell Hally, 
 or whatever her name is, 
 that she can stay. 
 She already went home. 
 Uh, good, good, good. 
 Then have her come back, 
 but make sure she deducts 
 for the time she was gone. 
 And give me 
 b*llet points 
 on who I can pink slip, 
 and for what reasons. 
 There are six unions 
 on the floor. 
 That's 12 volumes 
 of material. 
 Fine, do yours last. 
 So, uh... 
 so, what's the story here? 
 Sammy got ahold 
 of Dad's nail g*n. 
 Who knew he'd use it 
 as a w*apon? 
 He's a seven-year-old boy. 
 Everything's a w*apon. 
 This the nail g*n injury? 
 Yeah. 
 Well, Dr. Corday's 
 got this now. 
 Apparently, Sammy didn't think 
 it was loaded. 
 No. I knew. 
 Well, the puncture appears 
 to have glanced off the rib. 
 You'll be fine. 
 D.T. and a 
 gram of Ancef? 
 Yeah... and, uh, 
 a psych consult 
 for the son, perhaps. 
 So, how's it going 
 down here? 
 Want to hear 
 something scary? 
 I miss Weaver. 
 Fresh pot. 
 Enjoy it 
 while you can. 
 How you doing? 
 Very well, thanks. 
 New digs, new 
 challenges, 
 crappy coffee. 
 Interest you in a cup? 
 I'll pass. 
 Smart woman. 
 Look, I think it's awful, 
 just to let you know. 
 A waste... really, of your... 
 of your skills, your talents, 
 but, um, I'm sure 
 it will be temporary. 
 Yeah. 
 Anything I can do 
 to help? 
 ( clattering ) 
 You could sh**t me now. 
 B.P. stable 120/78, 
 and the tox screen's back. 
 No dr*gs or alcohol 
 in his system, crit's 50. 
 Hemoconcentrated. 
 Neuro exam looks non-focal. 
 I don't know. 
 On his own, no car, 
 out in the middle of nowhere. 
 You think he 
 was robbed? 
 Still had his wallet 
 with him. 
 Maybe he got dumped. 
 Maybe his 
 wife knows. 
 He's wearing 
 a wedding ring. 
 They're trying 
 to track her down. 
 100 of thiamine, 
 just in case. 
 Did you know about it? 
 What? 
 The Romano coup d'√©tat. 
 No idea. 
 Does it mean anything? 
 Yeah, we're screwed. 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 John, I have to 
 turn over a number of 
 outstanding projects. 
 Resident's time study, 
 a Q/A of our portable 
 ultrasound training. 
 I'd be really grateful 
 if you'd see them through. 
 Sure. 
 Excellent. 
 So... how long is Romano 
 going to be down here? 
 What makes you think 
 it's not permanent? 
 Because whoever 
 runs the department 
 has to have good communication 
 and clinical skills. 
 He is, uh... he's 
 an experienced physician. 
 His background 
 is entirely surgical. 
 John, you have to be 
 associate professor 
 before you can be considered 
 for department head. 
 I don't want his job, Kerry. 
 I just don't want 
 to have to do two of them. 
 All right. 
 Which one of you smartasses 
 stole my crutch? 
 ( speaking Croatian ) 
 Do you have any plans 
 for tonight? 
 Oh, me and this guy named TiVo. 
 We're going to curl up 
 in front of the tube. You? 
 Nah. 
 Everything okay? 
 Woman I went to med school with 
 has a patient who's very sick. 
 Young boy. 
 Is he terminal? 
 Post shunt Tetrology 
 with pulmonary atresia. 
 Oh. 
 He's outgrowing 
 the shunts. 
 He needs unifoc 
 and complete repair. 
 That's a pretty 
 specialized procedure. 
 ( man groaning ) 
 Yup, so special 
 it can't be done there. 
 Nicky Broomer, 
 fell while running. 
 Shoulder dislocation and 
 probable rib fracture. 
 Vitals normal except 
 for pulse of 120. 
 ( screaming ) 
 This guy's 
 a runner? 
 He's a junkie. 
 He gets chased 
 by the cops 
 on a regular basis. 
 He fell on the sidewalk, 
 all right? It was wet. 
 Are you high now, 
 Nicky? 
 No, and he's staying 
 that way. 
 Mint condition. 
 The entire lot. 
 The sky's the limit 
 as far as mark up 
 and the whole shebang's 
 yours for only 30 bucks. 
 Hey. 
 I thought you said 
 you couldn't walk, 
 your foot hurt so bad. 
 I hopped. 
 I'm on the phone here. 
 Yeah, take two Tylenol 
 every four hours 
 and get a real job. 
 Hey, it's at 3:00. 
 What? 
 Cake for Chen. 
 Oh, right, right. 
 So, Chuny, what do you think-- 
 flowers or candy? 
 Ah, it's got to be 
 something she can wear 
 or what's the point? 
 Okay, let's see 
 who's losing the dispo race. 
 Why that would be... 
 Dr. Pratt, 
 who will now be punished 
 for his indolent ways. 
 Lower back pain in Two, 
 and an unknown intestinal 
 disturbance in Four. 
 Chop, chop. 
 In second to last place 
 we have Dr. Lewis. 
 Well that's to be expected 
 from one who ovulates. 
 She gets the maggot 
 infestation in Two 
 and then of course 
 we have Mr. Gallant 
 who's doing Cadillac work ups 
 on Yugo patients. 
 How are you, hun? 
 Don't tell me. 
 Don't tell me. 
 Says right here, 
 ""My blood pressure is high."" 
 Well, hell, so's mine. 
 But rather than go 
 to a busy ER, 
 I stay home and take 
 my prescribed medication. 
 Have you tried that 
 at all? 
 She's also diabetic 
 and her EKG... 
 Is entirely unnecessary. 
 Give he a sublingual 
 Nifedipine 
 and send her to clinic. 
 Yeah, but that's not a... 
 Are you filling 
 some sort of 
 special needs quota 
 here, Mr. Gallant? 
 You need me to say it slowly in 
 the language of your people? 
 ( slurred ): 
 Sublingual Nifedipine. 
 And when you're 
 done with her, 
 pick up six more. 
 She's your patient, 
 not your mother. 
 They're letting any 
 bottom feeder 
 with a check into 
 med school these days? 
 Actually, Gallant is one 
 of our best med students. 
 Well that 
 doesn't bode well 
 for the future 
 of emergency medicine 
 but maybe by the time 
 he gets his license 
 we'll all be dead. 
 Typical, as Chief Resident, 
 I assign the med students 
 their cases. 
 Oh, when, 
 every other Tuesday? 
 Any patient here 
 over six hours 
 is a failure of your 
 management skills, not mine. 
 Treat, turf, or dispo. 
 With all due respect, 
 you don't have a background 
 in emergency medicine, 
 and quite frankly, 
 it isn't all that simple. 
 Feast or famine? 
 Hey, you're back. 
 Yeah, another chopper 
 beat us to the punch. 
 Is Susan around? 
 Yeah. 
 ( screaming ) 
 Okay, your screaming isn't 
 making our job any easier. 
 This is hard for him. 
 Settle down, okay? 
 It hurts like a son of a bitch. 
 It's going 
 to continue to hurt 
 unless we pull 
 your arm out. 
 Radial pulse 
 is still strong. 
 Oh, God, please help me! 
 Maybe you should 
 just go ahead 
 and give him more 
 of versed or Fent. 
 Yes! Yes! 
 We already did, 
 he should be unconscious. 
 Then why is he 
 still screaming? 
 I don't know. 
 His ribs are broken. 
 Yeah, that and he's 
 going through withdrawal. 
 I can't take it, baby! 
 Hey, Susan. 
 What?! 
 I got a guy here 
 who says he's your husband. 
 What's he look like? 
 Uh... 
 tall, dark hair, flight nurse. 
 Yeah, that's him. 
 ( man continues screaming ) 
 You were in Las Vegas 
 for, like, two days. 
 And three nights. 
 We met on the plane 
 on the way over there. 
 Hung out all weekend. 
 Were you sober 
 at any point? 
 Sunday night, 
 we wanted burgers 
 so we took a cab 
 to this drive through. 
 Turns out to be a mini-chapel. 
 Ah, so you figured, 
 ""What the hell, 
 let's get married."" 
 I know, it was impulsive. 
 Impulsive? 
 Okay, it was really, 
 really stupid. 
 Susan... 
 I'm getting it 
 annulled anyway. 
 I haven't seen him 
 since the wedding night. 
 Well my flight 
 left the next morning, 
 he stayed there for a week. 
 He could have married 
 six other women by now. 
 Hey, do even remember 
 his name at least? 
 Uh, Chuck... 
 Martin? 
 I think. 
 Good luck. 
 Hey, stranger. 
 Hey. 
 Look, Nifedipine 
 is contraindicated. 
 I'm not bottoming out 
 her pressure 
 and stroking this lady out. 
 Gallant, you are preaching 
 to the choir. 
 He's the one that needs 
 to be educated about this. 
 And he wants to hear 
 that from a med student. 
 Look, obviously he needs... 
 Blah, blah, blah. 
 Go talk to him. 
 If there's a problem 
 I'll take care of it. 
 Got a lot of people scared. 
 Not you. 
 Still need to pay my rent. 
 Come on, Romano's bark 
 is so much worse 
 than his bite. 
 Easy for you to say. 
 You can walk away 
 if you want to. 
 So, Susan got married, 
 huh? 
 Can't call her indecisive. 
 Call her crazy. 
 When are you people 
 going to do something? 
 Oh, God... 
 So I spoke 
 to an attorney. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 He said annulling 
 the marriage should 
 be fairly easy. 
 That's what my guy said. 
 I have to admit, 
 I was a little worried. 
 Why? 
 Well, you know. 
 It was consummated. 
 Oh, yeah, right. 
 A few times, as I remember. 
 More than a few times. 
 The cabana? 
 Right, right. 
 Right, but since we 
 never lived together, 
 I figure it shouldn't 
 be a problem. 
 You say anything to anyone? 
 Like who? My mom? 
 She'd kick my ass if she knew 
 I deprived her of a wedding. 
 Same with mine. 
 I kind of figured it wasn't 
 anyone's business, you know? 
 Exactly. 
 And pretty tough 
 to explain, too. 
 Please, 
 who are you telling? 
 Kind of had 
 to have been there. 
 Yeah, made sense 
 at the time. 
 Guess you have to get 
 back to work. 
 Nah. 
 Morales, you don't write, 
 you don't call. 
 No time to radio. 
 24-year-old female, 
 passed out at Marshall Field's. 
 No trauma, no seizure. 
 What? 
 You were shopping? 
 We were registering. 
 Debra's pregnant. 
 Don't tell me, you were 
 going to say that next. 
 LOCKHART: 
 BP's 100/60. 
 Sats are good. 
 Do you remember 
 falling, Debra? 
 I remember feeling weak, 
 but I haven't been eating. 
 Okay. 
 Start a second line 
 and put up another liter. 
 Morning sickness? 
 Oh, bad. 
 My first wife had three kids. 
 She never even burped. 
 Maybe I'm not cut out for this. 
 What have we got? 
 Debra Strickland, 
 pregnant syncope, 18 weeks. 
 Hi, Debra. 
 Any cramping or spotting? 
 No. 
 Okay, let's spin a crit, 
 check a glucose and dip 
 a urine to start. 
 Ow! 
 That hurts? 
 Mm-hmm. And my belly. 
 It never did before. 
 How about when I do this? 
 Ow! 
 Yeah. 
 Abby, can you see if 
 Linda Woo is still here? 
 I can check. 
 Finally get 
 a surgical candidate? 
 Oh, God, I need an operation? 
 Not necessarily. 
 Stripe in Morrison's. 
 Yup. 
 And in the pericolic 
 gutter. 
 Probably blood judging 
 from her hypertension. 
 Put the probe back 
 over the kidney. 
 It is. 
 That doesn't look like it. 
 It's not. 
 Surgery's here. 
 What do you have for me? 
 24-year-old, 
 18 week IUP 
 with hypertension, 
 intraperitoneal fluid 
 and a renal mass. 
 Obvious ex-lap 
 for tissue diagnosis 
 and staging. 
 Who are you? 
 Dr. Robert Romano, 
 head of surgery 
 less than a week ago. 
 Who the hell are you? 
 This is Dr. Woo. 
 She started yesterday. 
 Ma'am, do you have any medical 
 problems or allergies? 
 Are you deaf? 
 Um, let me page Corday. 
 I'll do it. 
 BP is dropping, 86/62. 
 Any moron can see she needs 
 surgical intervention for 
 hemostasis. 
 Take her up. 
 I'm sorry, 
 what's your position here? 
 Your practical 
 and intellectual superior 
 with over 20 years 
 of surgical experience 
 versus the two years 
 of ass wiping 
 you call residency. 
 Take her up. 
 Done. 
 He was diagnosed 
 at birth, 
 but access to any kind of care 
 has been limited at best. 
 He's been revised? 
 Twice. 
 The last time, 
 five years ago 
 and the surgical team that 
 performed it in Croatia 
 has disbanded since then. 
 And there's 
 nothing else in Europe? 
 Nothing they 
 can afford. 
 And County's pediatric 
 thoracic group does 
 unifocalization all the time. 
 Free of charge. 
 Yes, but he's not a citizen. 
 Neither are we, 
 but we are here. 
 Look, even if you get 
 a surgical team 
 to donate services, 
 who's going to pick 
 up the hospital tab? 
 With some PR, 
 charitable contributions 
 could cover it. 
 Yeah, but Kerry would still 
 have to sign off on it. 
 Are you on 
 good terms with her? 
 Uh, not really. 
 Well neither am I. 
 Look, leave it with me, 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 Thanks. 
 Where's Dr. Woo? 
 She... left. 
 You need to teach 
 your residents 
 to have thicker 
 skin, Lizzie. 
 She only cried a little. 
 Pratt's consoling her. 
 Oh, dear. 
 Crit's 19, type and 
 cross for eight 
 and transfer two as 
 soon as we get them. 
 Right. 
 Interperotineal fluid 
 and a mass. 
 And pregnant with 
 profound hypertension. 
 My guess, renal cell CA. 
 Necrotic mass 
 obscuring and deforming 
 the capsule of the left kidney. 
 Bleeding across 
 the peritoneum, 
 more like metastases. 
 She'll definitely 
 need surgery. 
 Hello. 
 I'd like a CT of 
 the abdomen if I can 
 and have OB involved 
 as well. 
 She's stable enough now. 
 Yeah, sure, why don't we 
 get a third consult, 
 maybe ask the janitor 
 what he thinks. 
 I'm down here less than a day, 
 already I'm starting 
 to hate surgeons. 
 Is something wrong 
 with the baby? 
 No. 
 The baby's quite healthy, 
 actually. 
 GALLANT: 
 Dr. Romano. 
 You have a minute? 
 Less than. 
 It's about my high blood 
 pressure patient this morning. 
 I should have 
 pointed it out to you, 
 but the use of 
 sublingual Nifedipine 
 is no longer indicated 
 because of a number 
 of case fatalities 
 from stroke. 
 I never said Nifedipine, 
 I said up her Metroprolol. 
 Works fine for 
 hypertension. 
 No, actually you said 
 Nifedipine and you said... 
 Okay, okay, listen, 
 okay, Goofus. 
 I'm the doctor, you're not. 
 It seems to me that 
 if it is your intention... 
 My intention is to serve 
 out my time in this hell hole 
 without having Affirmative 
 Action imbeciles like you 
 make me regret ever 
 having gone into medicine. 
 Your minute's up. 
 Hey, where are my b*llet points? 
 Uh, right. 
 Well, obviously you can't fire 
 medical students, 
 but failing them is a bad idea, 
 because then they just have 
 to repeat the rotation. 
 I'd suggest a marginal pass. 
 All right, what else? 
 ( Nicky groaning ) 
 You can, however, 
 fire care partners. 
 What the hell's 
 a care partner? 
 I can't stand it. 
 I'm in pain. 
 It's like a... 
 non-union orderly. 
 Hey, you. 
 What's your name? 
 Ah, I can't stand... 
 I'm in pain... 
 Jim. 
 Yeah, you pay 
 union dues, Jim? 
 No. 
 Good. You're fired. 
 I need something! 
 That is putting me on edge. 
 Yeah, well, it was a lot worse 
 when his girlfriend was here. 
 Tell Lewis to gag him, 
 sedate him, or k*ll him. 
 She's on break. 
 What? Is there some prerequisite 
 for working here? 
 You have to be 
 a know-nothing drag ass 
 who doesn't 
 wear a watch? 
 I always suspected 
 Weaver would k*ll her own mother 
 to get out of this dung heap, 
 and now I know why. 
 Because apparently, 
 only the Chief 
 of Emergency Medicine 
 is concerned 
 with clearing the board. 
 You got to help me. 
 Hands off, low life. 
 Oh, somebody... 
 All right, you. 
 Where are 
 your parents? 
 I don't have any. 
 They died in a car 
 crash last year. 
 ( moaning ) 
 Bummer. So, what's your problem? 
 I need it 
 bad, man. 
 I need something 
 really bad. 
 Hey, Chuny, could you 
 move him into Exam Four? 
 My pleasure. 
 Come on. 
 Oh God, I need a push. 
 Wait. Just one more paragraph 
 in the lab tech union manual. 
 Can you make sure 
 that I see all of 
 Romano's patients 
 before anyone gets 
 dispo'ed today? 
 Sure. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Doesn't mean you 
 don't have to 
 work with him. 
 Okay, where were we? 
 Um, I reached 
 for the soap, 
 down I went, landed 
 right on my... rump. 
 Well, that's not good. 
 Any loss of consciousness? 
 No, just loss 
 of dignity. 
 I know, I know, 
 I'm late, I'm late. 
 I had to move Nicky. 
 He was driving everybody crazy. 
 Oh, sorry, 
 thank you. 
 And I sent up labs on your 
 hyperemesis patient, 
 dispo'ed your ""no longer itchy"" 
 rash guy. 
 Yikes, was I gone that long? 
 I'll tell you what. 
 If you take Sandra here, 
 we'll call it even. 
 I got to go check 
 on a patient up in CT. 
 Done. 
 Slip-and-fall in the shower, 
 possible wrist fracture. 
 Congratulations. 
 On what? 
 Your newlywed status. 
 Ooh, lucky. 
 Excuse me. 
 Oh, I've probably 
 been looking for Mr. Right 
 ten years longer than you, 
 and still haven't found him. 
 ( coughing ) 
 Last time it happened, 
 they kept me here. 
 ( coughing ) 
 You're done? 
 I think so. 
 What happened 
 to your arm? 
 Are you physically incapable 
 of keeping your mouth shut? 
 I mean, were you born 
 that way or something? 
 None of your beeswax. 
 Breathe deep. 
 Hey. What do you do 
 for soft asthma? 
 A couple of nebs 
 and some prednisone? 
 You're asking a nurse? 
 Yeah, what you said, 
 only I take an 
 adult dose now. 
 What he said I said. 
 Then discharge with follow-up. 
 Okay. That took all 
 of eight minutes. 
 See people, 
 it can be done. 
 What can be done? 
 Oh, BS-ing your 
 way through a 
 shift, I suppose. 
 Hey, listen, I didn't mean 
 to be nosy before. 
 I was just 
 making little talk. 
 Small talk. 
 Dr. Kovac, 
 your exposure guy is coming to. 
 Any word 
 on Rushing's wife? 
 No, they're still 
 trying to get 
 hold of her. 
 Mr. Rushing? 
 Mr. Rushing, 
 can you understand me? 
 Yeah. 
 Do you know 
 what happened to you? 
 Car... 
 ( labored breathing ) 
 ...crashed. 
 Your car? 
 ( labored breathing ) 
 Where are they? 
 Who? 
 My kids. 
 We were driving... 
 Walked to get help. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Go get the police. 
 His kids are still 
 out there somewhere. 
 ( shuddering ) 
 ( soft groan ) 
 So, how long 
 have you been married? 
 Um, two years. 
 Some people think the age 
 difference is a problem, 
 but I can't keep 
 up with him. 
 We're going to minimize 
 the exposure 
 to protect the baby. 
 ""Our little accident,"" 
 Bill likes to call him. 
 Oh, you're having a boy? 
 Just a guess. 
 Will you be 
 able to tell? 
 No, not with this. 
 Oh, good. 
 I want to be surprised. 
 Okay, you have 
 to lay very still, 
 and there's an intercom 
 in case you want to talk. 
 Okay. 
 CT Abdo/Pelvis with... 
 and without. 
 Fine cuts right 
 through the kidney. 
 Debra, when we sh**t 
 the rest of the dye in, 
 you may continue 
 to feel kind of a warm 
 tingling sensation. 
 Okay. 
 Well, there it is. 
 Some smaller masses 
 in the abdominal cavity, too. 
 But, hey, 
 I'm just the tech. 
 Hematoma and fluid 
 from where the main tumor bled. 
 She's going 
 to need a nephrectomy. 
 Yeah, like now. 
 Well, I guess Romano was right 
 about one thing today. 
 DEBRA: 
 Is it almost over? 
 What are their names? 
 S... Sally. 
 Tim. 
 Do you know 
 how badly they were hurt? 
 It was dark. 
 ( labored breathing ) 
 I just remember crying... 
 LOCKHART: 
 B.P.'s stable. 
 128/80. 
 Pulse is 106. 
 They were 
 so scared. 
 ( crying ) 
 LOCKHART: 
 Luka... 
 Uh, another liter 
 of warm saline. 
 Do you recall 
 where it happened? 
 Do you recall 
 when it happened? 
 No. 
 ( crying ) 
 They're dead, aren't they? 
 LOCKHART: 
 We're trying 
 to find them. 
 OFFICER: 
 I'm going to start 
 calling some of this in. 
 Okay, this guy's 
 approaching the six hour mark. 
 Is he stable? 
 Just finishing up a Heimlich. 
 Which is the cheesy ER way 
 of dealing with a pneumothorax. 
 I did it so he could stay here 
 in case his 
 family's found. 
 So turf him to medicine. 
 Let them hold hands 
 and sing ""Kumbaya"" there. 
 His kids could 
 be seriously hurt. 
 That's right. 
 But he's not, so get him 
 the hell out of my trauma room. 
 Look... 
 What, what, what? 
 Is this mandatory therapy crap 
 making you a little soft, Kovac? 
 Do us both a favor. 
 Stop seeing your shrink. 
 I don't believe in it, 
 and frankly, 
 if you're that screwed up, quit. 
 Where the hell 
 have you been? 
 Get back to work. 
 Hey, welcome back. 
 Right. X ray's 
 backed up, 
 and she's complaining 
 of a headache. 
 Let's get her 
 to curtain area three 
 and give her some Tylenol. 
 You could probably 
 use a lunch tray by now. 
 What I could 
 use is a husband. 
 Does yours 
 have a brother? 
 Oh, no. Damn! 
 Kippy, my man! 
 Foot still 
 hurts like hell! 
 I should sue 
 you clowns. 
 Yeah, yeah, look, 
 I'm in a rush man. 
 What you got 
 for the ladies? 
 Stuffed animals. 
 No, man. 
 I need something 
 that a lady can wear. 
 Ah... 
 I got some handmade jewelry, 
 some perfume... 
 tie-dyed T-shirt! 
 Uh-uh. 
 Wait! 
 We got some new items in. 
 How much? 
 What's this doing here? 
 Uh, we always have cake 
 when it's someone's birthday. 
 Woman pops a kid out, 
 what the hell difference 
 does it make what day it is? 
 No more official 
 or unofficial recognition 
 of birthdays. 
 Oh, you can't be serious. 
 Singing, blowing out candles, 
 eating. 
 By the time 
 it's all said and done, 
 everybody's had a half-hour 
 break with pay. 
 It fosters community. 
 Yeah, and lethargy 
 by the looks of things. 
 Sandra Haycox. 
 What about her? 
 She has a broken wrist. 
 Cast her and cast her off. 
 She's complaining 
 of a headache now. 
 Uh-uh. Tell her to take a number 
 and get back in line. 
 One complaint per visit. 
 Hey, who ate my cake? 
 ( girl screaming ) 
 What happened? 
 Eight-year-old 
 front passenger in 
 a single-car MVA. 
 Seat belt, 
 shoulder harness. 
 Air bag deployed. 
 Pretty hard 
 from the looks of it. 
 Facial abrasions. 
 May have a 
 ruptured globe. 
 Why was she sitting 
 in the front seat? 
 Ask Grandma. 
 The tumor outgrew 
 it's blood supply, 
 then part of it died, 
 ruptured and bled. 
 That's why 
 you passed out. 
 It could rupture again 
 at any moment, 
 so it's important 
 that we remove it 
 and the kidney 
 as soon as possible. 
 Well, what kind 
 of a tumor is it? 
 We don't know. 
 And we 
 won't know 
 until we get a 
 pathology report. 
 Do you think it's cancer? 
 Let's take this one step 
 at a time. 
 My mother died of cancer. 
 If that's what this is, 
 I should know. 
 Debra... 
 I should know. 
 CORDAY: 
 It appears likely 
 to be renal cell carcinoma, yes. 
 And, if it's as 
 aggressive as it seems, 
 it's possible 
 that you would require chemo 
 and radiation therapy 
 following surgery. 
 CARTER: 
 Unfortunately, 
 chemotherapy 
 is unadvisable 
 while pregnant. 
 You said it was aggressive. 
 Yes, but... 
 Take it out. 
 Take everything. 
 Are you saying you wish 
 to terminate, as well? 
 Just... just do it all at once. 
 Typically, those 
 procedures would 
 be done separately. 
 CORDAY: 
 If you had 
 the surgery, 
 and then waited 
 until after 
 the baby was born... 
 I want the chemo. 
 Honey... 
 ( crying ) 
 I want it now. 
 CARTER: 
 We're going 
 to leave you 
 alone to talk. 
 ( crying ) 
 Honey. 
 I guess she figures 
 she can try again 
 if she beats 
 the cancer. 
 In three week's time, 
 the fetus might be viable 
 outside the womb. 
 She could fight it then. 
 She doesn't want 
 to take that chance. 
 She's young. 
 She's scared. 
 Yeah. 
 * La gallina busca 
 el maize y el trigo * 
 pH is still over nine. 
 Pilar, how many fingers 
 do I have? 
 No veo nada! 
 * Los pollitos dicen 
 pio, pio, pio * 
 Do you think 
 the blindness 
 is temporary? 
 I've seen alkali keratitis 
 go both ways, 
 but this doesn't look good. 
 How's Grandma? 
 Well, she needs an immobilizer 
 for her knee. 
 Otherwise, she's fine. 
 What a difference 
 height makes, huh? 
 Why would anybody put their kid 
 in the front seat? 
 She begged me to. 
 She's my only 
 grandchild. 
 I just wanted 
 to make her happy. 
 Could you grab 
 a couple of 
 Morgan Lenses 
 from the eye 
 exam room? 
 CHEN: 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Okay, this isn't 
 going down 
 as one of my 
 better days. 
 That applies 
 to all of us. 
 Wait a minute. 
 Why is it quiet 
 all of a sudden? 
 ( sighs ) 
 Unbelievable! 
 It was too hard to watch. 
 So you went 
 out and scored? 
 You weren't doing anything. 
 I had to. 
 You want Narcan? 
 Put him on 
 a monitor. 
 At least 
 someone's happy. 
 Of course, it would be pro bono. 
 Have you looked 
 at our budget lately? 
 Every time we open our doors, 
 we're working pro bono. 
 We're in a deep deficit, 
 Elizabeth. 
 I could contact local 
 cardiac surgeons 
 and specialists, ask them 
 to donate their services. 
 Which would account 
 for about 25% 
 of the total costs, 
 and forget about Medicaid. 
 The boy's not even 
 a U.S. citizen. 
 Well, that might 
 be something 
 that would 
 interest the media. 
 I mean, look at 
 the-the separation 
 of the Guatemalan 
 conjoined twins. 
 Well, somehow, 
 I don't think 
 a Croatian kid needing 
 a Tet Repair is going 
 to get the same draw. 
 Kerry, he's nine years old. 
 He'll die without it. 
 And we're just not able 
 to help right now, I'm sorry. 
 ( pager beeping ) 
 Kerry, can I ask you something? 
 Are you as concerned 
 about Robert as I am? 
 Uh, more precisely... 
 his mental health. 
 He seems... 
 broken by this assignment. 
 He's a cockroach. 
 He'll refuse to evolve, 
 and yet survive us all. 
 Talk to me 
 about residents. 
 Um, you need beaucoup 
 documentation, 
 but you have a more 
 powerful w*apon 
 in scheduling. 
 As long as they 
 don't pull more 
 than 16 shifts a month, 
 or work more than 
 three nights in a row, 
 you can book them 
 for every weekend, 
 holiday, or playoff 
 night you want. 
 That's good stuff. 
 Thank you. 
 How come the delinquent hasn't 
 been dispo'ed yet? 
 Uh... that wasn't on my 
 list of things to do. 
 You didn't give Eddie 
 enough prednisone 
 with his albuterol. 
 Let me get something straight. 
 You overrode my orders? 
 Yeah. 
 Before he can leave, 
 he needs to be able to walk 
 and hold normal sats, 
 which he can't do. 
 Uh-oh, you screwed up. 
 No, I did not. 
 Maybe you haven't 
 been listening. 
 There's a lot of basic 
 medical treatments... 
 Because I believe 
 I've made myself clear. 
 a surgeon wouldn't 
 do every day, 
 and a lot of people here 
 who can help you... 
 You don't question my judgment. 
 keep from making 
 critical mistakes... 
 You do not 
 override my orders... 
 that would result 
 in serious injury... 
 and you sure as hell don't 
 get too comfortable here, 
 Dr. Carter. 
 This is my ER now. 
 And it stands for one thing-- 
 Everyone's Replaceable... 
 even you. 
 I need to know what 
 to tell the guy. 
 That better be 
 a local call. 
 It's a police matter. 
 They haven't found 
 the car yet? 
 We checked every road, 
 bridge, and river 
 within five miles of 
 where we found him. 
 Why not ten or 15? 
 There's no way he 
 could've walked that far 
 with those injuries. 
 He was getting help 
 for his children. 
 Man... 
 I'm already covering 
 a lot of territory. 
 With search teams, 
 with dogs? 
 It's 40 degrees 
 out there. 
 Look, we're doing all we can. 
 Luka, where's Dr. Romano? 
 I don't know 
 and I don't care. 
 Hey, Chuny, how's it going? 
 Don't even. 
 John. 
 Thought you 
 were long gone. 
 Yeah, I just wanted to check 
 and see how Robert 
 was doing. 
 As expected, 
 he was abysmal. 
 He has no patient rapport, 
 severely stunted 
 interpersonal skills, 
 and he's incredibly 
 hostile. 
 Qualities consistent 
 with most surgeons. 
 Kerry, the guy doesn't 
 know what he's doing, 
 and he doesn't 
 want to learn. 
 And he almost k*lled 
 a patient today 
 by prescribing 
 an antiquated treatment. 
 But obviously, you stopped 
 him from doing so. 
 Yeah, but I can't stay 
 on top of the guy 24-7. 
 I'm trying to shift him to 
 a more administrative role. 
 What are you going to do, 
 chain him to his desk? 
 Look, the ER may 
 not be the best 
 fit for Dr. Romano, 
 but it's all 
 the man has. 
 Just make it work, 
 or better yet, 
 work around him. 
 Okay. 
 Excuse me. I'm Diana Rushing. 
 I got a message 
 saying my husband 
 was brought here. 
 Yeah, Dr. Kovac; 
 he treated your husband. 
 What is it? 
 Rushing's wife. 
 I'll take you to him. 
 Is he okay? Been 
 worried sick 
 the whole drive over 
 here-- I'm from Indiana. 
 He's stable, but he's 
 obviously very upset. 
 When did you see 
 them last? 
 Josh left home four 
 days ago. Who's ""them""? 
 Your husband 
 and your children. 
 What children? 
 He said he was with them 
 in the car when he crashed. 
 We don't have children. 
 Her caretaker says 
 she's been complaining 
 of white discharge. 
 She have her 
 period yet? 
 Says she's a real woman. 
 Mindy, hi, I'm Dr. Lewis. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Good. 
 We're going to do a test 
 on your private parts, okay? 
 Set up for a pelvic. 
 It's probably a simple 
 yeast infection. 
 Sandra? How's your headache. 
 Did the acetaminophen help? 
 Sandra... Sandra? 
 I need a crash cart. 
 I thought she came in 
 with a broken wrist. 
 She did. 
 What happened? 
 I don't know. 
 Pulseless and apneic. 
 V-fib. Charging to 200. 
 And clear. 
 Unit number six, going up. 
 Tumor mass has invaded 
 the renal artery wall 
 and sections of the vena cava. 
 You want me 
 to call again? 
 They won't tell me anything 
 I don't already know-- 
 it's stage 4B by the size 
 and the spread of it. 
 Let's take the kidney out. 
 INTERCOM: 
 Dr. Corday, call on line one. 
 If it's Path, put it on speaker. 
 Pedicle clamp in place. 
 Metz to divide the vessels. 
 Dr. Corday? 
 Yes, Dr. Meechum, 
 what are your findings? 
 Furhman Grad four 
 with sarcomatoid pattern 
 and a high mitotic picture. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 Done. Steel bowl. 
 That's bad, 
 I take it. 
 Irresectable. We'd be doing her 
 a favor if she bled to death. 
 Her chance of survival is less 
 than 2% at this point. 
 Get her husband up here. 
 I want to speak to him now. 
 Charge again to 360 and clear. 
 Asystole. 
 It's been 20 minutes. 
 Uh, try another amp of epi. 
 JOHN: 
 And... clear. 
 ABBY: 
 No pressure, no pulse. 
 JOHN: 
 A headache, a fall, 
 a blown pupil... 
 possibly jogged an aneurysm 
 she already had. 
 ABBY: 
 No way you could 
 have known about it. 
 JOHN: 
 No way she could have 
 known about it. 
 Yeah, I'm sure she wasn't 
 planning on dying today. 
 ( sighs ) 
 18:27. 
 Well, he's depressed. 
 That, combined with aspects 
 of disassociative disorder 
 allowed him to create this 
 weird, negative amnesia. 
 Was it a psychotic break? 
 Mm, not per se, but 
 he definitely needs 
 inpatient psych care. 
 When he talked about them, 
 he made them sound so real. 
 Well, to him they are. 
 Right now, anyway. 
 But they won't always be. 
 With the right meds, 
 it'll all fade away. 
 Ow! 
 Cervical motion 
 tenderness. 
 PID? 
 Yup. 
 Mindy, do you have 
 a boyfriend? 
 Uh-huh. 
 You're pretty young 
 to be having sex, 
 much less 
 unprotected sex. 
 You need to tell him 
 to use condoms. 
 What are those? 
 That's not a good sign. 
 Can you tell me his name 
 so we can make sure 
 he gets checked? 
 He cleans floors. 
 He says he loves me. 
 400 of cefixime 
 and a gram of azithro. 
 We're just going to help 
 you get dressed, okay? 
 Oh, man. 
 You want me to call 
 the facility? 
 Nah, call the police first. 
 It's official. This has been one 
 of the worst days of my life. 
 Careful. Don't jinx yourself. 
 ( sighs ): 
 Ugh. 
 Good night, everyone. 
 Happy birthday, 
 Dr. Chen. 
 Oh, thanks. 
 Hey, my gloves. 
 What? 
 Camel colored 
 with lambskin inside, 
 are those mine? 
 No. 
 No. Greg just gave 
 them to me. 
 They were in my 
 locker this morning. 
 Yeah, so what? I bought 
 those out on the street. 
 You bought these on the street? 
 Yeah, from Kippy. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's a long story. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry, I mean... 
 ( scoffs ): 
 I can't believe you bought my 
 birthday present on the street. 
 Yeah, but it was a good deal. 
 I mean, they're genuine leather. 
 If I were you, I'd put 
 them under a Wood's lamp. 
 ( chuckles ): 
 Nice. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Well, I know we're 
 not supposed to 
 see each other 
 until the lawyer's office, 
 but I figured if your day 
 was half as bad as mine, 
 maybe you could 
 use some company. 
 Well, eight-year-old 
 blinded by an air bag, 
 woman keels over 
 of an aneurysm, 
 junkie sh**ting up 
 in the E.R., 
 and a teenage Down's Syndrome 
 girl with the clap. 
 Hmm. We had a family of four 
 trapped in a burning vehicle, 
 only one kid survived; 
 he's 18 months old. 
 You win. 
 What'd you get? 
 Oh, the, uh, burger 
 and fries we never got. 
 Knit one, purl two? 
 You take much longer, 
 you're going to be sewing scabs. 
 If I go faster, the edges 
 don't evert well. 
 I love watching 
 med students suture. 
 It reminds me 
 how good I am. 
 Was. 
 What did you say? 
 He said ""was."" 
 Loose stools in Exam Four. 
 Knock yourself out. 
 We're almost there. 
 Skin stapler will be next. 
 Cut, please. 
 Pressure's steady 
 at 110/68. 
 He's here. 
 Mr. Strickland...

 a highly malignant 
 and inoperable cancer. 
 Stapler ready. 
 Your-your wife's 
 chance of survival, 
 even with the most aggressive 
 form of chemotherapy, 
 is extremely poor. 
 But not impossible? 
 The one sure thing is that she 
 will survive long enough 
 to deliver your baby 
 if she doesn't seek treatment. 
 However, in order 
 for that to happen, 
 you'd have to reverse 
 her decision. 
 How close are we? 
 Almost closed. 
 She wants to live. 
 Mr. Strickland... 
 if you wish to overrule 
 your wife's decision, 
 you're going to have 
 to do it quickly. 
 The GYN team here is standing by 
 to perform an abortion. 
 ( gasping ) 
 I want her to live. 
 Your wife is going to die. 
 She's going to fight this. 
 Do you understand 
 this baby has a chance? 
 I ca... I can't. 
 I just can't. 
 Dr. Corday... 
 Dr. Corday. 
 Mr. Strickland. 
 Let's get her draped. 
 Start with 
 the sterile spec. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Another? 
 Yeah. 
 And stop skimping 
 on the peanuts. 
 ROMANO: 
 Hey... 
 how about putting 
 something on 
 for those of us in the room 
 without hairy knuckles? 
 Something wrong 
 with this show? 
 Yeah. It only appeals 
 to adults making less 
 than 20 grand a year. 
 30 grand. 
 Oh. Car wash gave 
 you a raise-- good for you. 
 I'm a copier tech. 
 Well, that explains

 Who's that? 
 LEWIS: 
 Med student. 
 Jane, why didn't you 
 say anything? 
 No one listens to me. 
 No one even remembers 
 I was in the room. 
 Third year resident, I've 
 been ordering my own scans 
 since I been here. 
 What's that about? 
 It's about me 
 making the rules. 
 Come on, that's stupid. 
 Congratulations, Jake. 
 Your ER rotation 
 is officially over. 
 Good evening. 
 Can I help you? 
 Room 415? 
 End of the hall. 
 Helen? 
 Helen, it's Kerry. 
 I don't want to leave it 
 like this. 
 The things that we said... 
 Is this how you 
 want to leave it? 
 If it is, tell me, 
 and I'll go away... 
 like we never even met. 
 I heard it was 
 supposed to be sunny 
 and slightly warmer today. 
 I heard ""partly cloudy, 
 chance of rain."" 
 Winter. 
 Did you know 
 that most snowflakes 
 are less than 
 one-half inch across? 
 Uh, no, I didn't... 
 Do you know 
 why they're white? 
 The complex structure 
 of snow crystals 
 results in countless 
 tiny surfaces 
 from which visible light 
 is efficiently reflected. 
 What little sunlight 
 is absorbed 
 is absorbed uniformly 
 over the visible wavelengths 
 thus giving snow 
 its white appearance. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 ( laughs ) 
 Alex had a school report. 
 Luka and I got 
 kind of into it. 
 Yeah, guess so. 
 Excuse me... 
 Do you know how much longer 
 I'll have to wait? 
 Ooh, that's nasty. 
 One of the other skaters 
 ripped into me. 
 This morning? 
 Skating club. 
 We only get the ice 
 from 5:30 to 7:00. 
 We'll get you checked in 
 in a couple of 
 minutes, okay? 
 Thanks. 
 Ugh, winter. 
 So it's already an 
 every-night kind of thing? 
 Since he started his 
 surgical rotation, yeah. 
 Dubenko's working him 
 pretty hard, 
 and my place is closer 
 to the hospital. 
 Oh, I see, so sleeping over 
 is basically a convenience. 
 No, we do like 
 each other. 
 And, do you know, his 
 real name isn't Jake, 
 it's George? 
 It's actually kind 
 of a funny story. 
 I mean, it's not funny- 
 funny, but it's... sorry. 
 Tibial plateau fracture, 
 ortho's taking to the OR. 
 Make sure he's NPO. 
 Got it. 
 Cellulitis following cat bite,

 Already did. 
 Antibiotics on board?

 DKA on an insulin drip, 
 going up to the ICU.

 back a 60-year-old lady, 
 Pick's Disease 
 with agitation. 
 I'm officially 
 out of here. 
 Thank you, Luka. 
 Hasta la vista, 
 suckers. 
 Dr. Barnett. 
 Ray, when you get home, 
 take the back stairs, 
 front ones are kind of frozen. 
 You didn't shovel? 
 You're kidding, right? 
 Oh, and the kitchen window, 
 I couldn't get it 
 to close all the way. 
 Meaning? 
 Meaning there's snow 
 in the kitchen. 
 Bit of a build-up, 
 actually, so you 
 might want to try 
 turning the oven on 
 and leaving the door open. 
 So it'll melt. 
 It's just a suggestion. 
 She used to be my roommate. 
 WEAVER: 
 Shall we get back 
 to medicine here? 
 Atypical chest pain

 How come Weaver's on?

 Teenage ice skater

 out in the waiting area. 
 Frank, let's get 
 a wheelchair. 
 Okay. 
 Someone might want 
 to grab the trauma 
 at the back door. 
 Carter, take Neela with you 
 on that chest pain. 
 Susan, 50-something woman, 
 dyspnea, curtain four. 
 Abby, Jane, you're with me. 
 Must be awkward for Dr. Lewis, 
 being chief, then having 
 Dr. Weaver back. 
 What, are you kidding? 
 Weaver comes in, takes 
 charge, runs all the cases. 
 Lewis loves it. 
 It's like having a day off. 
 Not so, however, 
 for the rest of us. 
 Altercation at someone's 
 all-night-turned-out-badly 
 birthday party. 
 Good morning, Dr. Pratt. 
 Yeah, half an inch of snow 
 and traffic grinds to a halt. 
 Multiple s*ab wounds 
 to the back with 
 a screwdriver. 
 You think he 
 dropped a lung? 
 Probably not, 
 sats are 100. 
 Abby and I have 
 got this one. 
 There's a woman there 
 with Pick's Disease. 
 Why don't you grab that. 
 Oh, and take Jane with you. 
 It's a good 
 teaching case. 
 I'm sure Jane has seen 
 more than her share 
 of combative patients 
 with dementia. 
 But not with you 
 as her teacher. 
 Have you, Jane? 
 You could start by 
 reviewing 
 the key elements 
 of the history, 
 physical, genetics, 
 differences from Alzheimer's. 
 Okay, okay, we're on it. 
 If it's any consolation, 
 I'm a blank slate when 
 it comes to Pick's Disease. 
 I know we studied it 
 maybe first year. 
 No, I think 
 it was second year. 
 No, it was first year. 
 What did she say 
 about Alzheimer's? 
 Man, talk about your 
 short-term memory loss. 
 Lousy son-of-a... 
 I'll get a piece, 
 you stupid fat piece of sh... 
 Nice language. 
 Equal breath sounds. 
 Pulse ox 98. 
 First hemocue? 
 13.8. 
 Okay, let's roll him. 
 We're going to roll you 
 onto your side, sir. 
 No head injury. 
 Guess he's 
 sleeping it off. 
 Regular or Phillips head? 
 What? 
 Stabbed with a 
 screwdriver, right? 
 Yes. At least 20 wounds, 
 all superficial. 
 I'd say regular. 
 Sonosite. 
 Mr. Scanlon, what 
 is Hamman's sign? 
 Uh... 
 A crunching sound heard 
 with pneumomediastinum, 
 listen for it. 
 TAGGART: 
 X-ray's back. 
 What is normal 
 intrapleural pressure? 
 Negative... 
 Negative ten to 12 millimeters 
 of mercury. 
 And what's the intra-alveolar 
 pressure? 
 Fluctuates. 
 Minus three with inspiration, 
 plus three with expiration. 
 So, Jake, tell me: 
 How does this poor guy 
 end up with a pneumothorax? 
 Penetrating trauma allows air 
 to enter the pleural space, 
 raising the pressure, 
 collapsing the alveoli. 
 Well done, Mr. Scanlon. 
 Fantastic. 
 BP 124/82. 
 Let's get him a floor bed. 
 He needs the ICU. 
 He's stable. 
 No, the guy's Swiss cheese. 
 He needs close observation. 
 We'll never get an ICU bed. 
 He doesn't need one, 
 no pneumo, his crit 
 and vitals are stable, 
 no blood in 
 the pericardium 
 or Morrison's. 
 He could have an occult 
 solid organ injury 
 or a delayed pneumothorax. 
 Are you going 
 to bludgeon us 
 with the differential? 
 Occasionally, 
 I can be thorough. 
 How about a tele admit? 
 Maybe after four hours. 
 Four hours? 
 Uh, Kerry, 
 that lady with dyspnea, 
 Sharon Williams, 
 she's asking for you. 
 Said she here before, 
 you were her doc. 
 Okay. This ""Swiss cheese"" 
 is stable. 
 Let's get him admitted 
 to a med-surg bed 
 and don't listen to any of 
 Dr. Dubenko's suggestions. 
 So, Dr. Lewis... 
 Don't start. 
 Oh, okay. 
 No problem. 
 We humble surgical servants 
 shall leave this 
 in your capable hands. 
 Uh, Jake... 
 do not move 
 Mr. Screwdriver 
 without a foley, 
 an NG, three crits and 
 a four-hour chest film. 
 Oh, and suture 
 all the lacs. 
 All 20 of them? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Sharon Williams, BP 124/70, 
 pulse ox 90. 
 No history of asthma 
 or emphysema. 
 Thanks, Haleh. 
 Sharon Williams? 
 You're Dr. Weaver? 
 I'm sorry, of course 
 you're Dr. Weaver. 
 You were in once before? 
 Yes. 
 And when was that? 
 Oh, God, let me think. 
 I don't know, 
 I can't quite remember. 
 You know, I'm actually 
 feeling much better now. 
 I probably didn't 
 need to come in. 
 Well, as long as you did... 
 Well, I don't... 
 This whole thing 
 is silly. 
 I don't know 
 what I was thinking. 
 I'm much better, 
 I'm breathing fine. 
 Why don't you 
 let me examine you 
 and we'll make sure of that. 
 Okay, you said you experienced 
 shortness of breath? 
 Yes. 
 Any cough or fever? 
 No. 
 Have you had any 
 prolonged periods 
 of immobilization 
 like a plane or car trip? 
 No. 
 Lungs sound good, 
 oxygen level is fine. 
 We'll check a few tests 
 and see what's going on. 
 Haleh, EKG, PA and 
 lateral chest, D-dimer. 
 Sure. 
 And I'll be back 
 to check on you later. 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 Yeah? 
 Is there something 
 you need? 
 No, no. 
 Well, yes... 
 It's not really 
 important. 
 What's not important? 
 Well, I was wondering, 
 the daughter 
 of a friend of mine 
 is thinking about 
 medical school. 
 Do you like 
 what you do? 
 Very much. 
 Did you always want 
 to be a doctor? 
 From when I was a little girl. 
 So you were lucky, 
 then, weren't you? 
 Getting the 
 opportunity to do it. 
 Ms. Williams, 
 is everything all right? 
 Oh, I'm fine, Kerry. 
 Really. 
 Thank you. 
 I don't want to take up 
 any more of your time. 
 Okay then. 
 Sharon Williams, 
 let's pull up her records 
 from the last time she was in. 
 Sure. 
 Can you wiggle 
 your fingers? 
 Can you wiggle 
 your fingers? 
 Why don't you just 
 give it a try for me? 
 Why don't you just 
 give it a try for me. 
 Charlotte, 
 Charlotte, the dinner party. 
 The dinner party, 
 they're going to be here early. 
 It's okay, Mom. 
 What are we going to do? 
 It's okay. 
 Mom, it's okay. 
 5:30 this morning 
 I hear her 
 crashing around 
 in the kitchen. 
 You got a bathroom 
 around here? 
 Chuny... 
 Mrs. Devon, you 
 can come with me. 
 You can come with me. 
 With me. 
 There is no 
 dinner party. 
 She was in the kitchen. 
 She thought she was 
 cutting chicken... 
 she was cutting her own hand. 
 Well, we're gonna take 
 care of that. 
 When did her symptoms start? 
 Two years ago. 
 She was only 58. 
 We've been able to keep 
 her at home, but now 
 I've got three kids. 
 What am I supposed to do? 
 WEAVER: 
 Labs back yet 
 on that syncope? 
 No. still waiting. 
 Call them again 
 and ask nicely. 
 ""Nicely""? We're never nicely. 
 Pratt, Pick's Disease? 
 Jane? 
 Uh, similarities 
 with Alzheimer's, 
 but with an earlier 
 age of onset 
 and a faster progression 
 of symptoms. 
 Mainly causes damage 
 to the frontal lobes 
 of the brain 
 resulting in disinhibition. 
 Patient can be extremely 
 rude, which we have seen, 
 and then can become 
 extremely loving, 
 which we have not seen. 
 Uh, often has a tendency 
 to repeat statements 
 spoken to them, 
 you know, but I'd actually 
 say it's a bit more... 
 Thank you, Jane. 
 Good job, good job. 
 Yes, and let me see-- 
 was that Dr. Pratt's 
 extremely efficient teaching 
 or was it... 
 ""eMedicine."" 
 She learned about it, 
 didn't she? 
 She learned the facts, 
 not necessarily how to handle 
 the patients or the family. 
 Yeah, but she will. 
 The woman's got 
 some lacerations. 
 We're going to suture her as 
 soon as the Ativan kicks in. 
 Dr. Pratt said that... 
 What about the family? 
 The daughter's trying to line 
 up a skilled nursing facility. 
 You should help her with that. 
 Isn't that 
 a social worker thing? 
 Just dive in. 
 See what you can do. 
 Hey, Sam, did that 
 screwdriver stabbing guy 
 get sent upstairs yet? 
 Uh, well, Dr. Dubenko 
 wanted a few things 
 taken care of first. 
 In what possible universe 
 would I say the words, 
 ""Let's polka""? 
 I'm telling you, in 
 your sleep two nights ago. 
 Look, I'm not making 
 this up. 
 You don't think 
 I was surprised? 
 I don't talk in my sleep. 
 How do you know? 
 Even if I did, 
 I wouldn't say ""polka."" 
 I wouldn't even say ""dance."" 
 I don't dance. 
 I mean, maybe once when 
 I was a kid I did the limbo. 
 Yeah, maybe that was it. 
 Maybe it was the limbo. 
 Ah, see? And you're 
 making it up. 
 ( both laughing ) 
 I'm sorry! 
 Dr. Lockhart. 
 Mr. Scanlon. 
 Kerry. 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 ...um, mixing up 
 some Ancef. 
 I'm just gathering 
 up supplies, so... 
 I thought you were 
 gathering up 
 a med-surg bed for the guy 
 with holes in his back. 
 I'd like very much 
 to do that. 
 Dr. Weaver. That patient, 
 Sharon Williams? 
 There's no record of 
 her being here before. 
 I asked her about it 
 and she got pretty nervous. 
 Wants to leave AMA. 
 Now? 
 Yeah. 
 ""Gathering supplies""? 
 Yeah. I know. Okay. I know. 
 Excuse me. Uh, that 
 woman who was here. 
 Did you see her leave? 
 Yeah, just now. 
 Kind of bolted. 
 You want me to try 
 and catch her? 
 Ms. Williams. 
 Please wait. 
 Your test results 
 aren't back yet. 
 I don't need 'em. 
 It shouldn't be 
 much longer. 
 I don't need 'em. 
 You could have 
 a blood clot in the lung 
 or fluid around 
 your heart. 
 Stop, please. 
 I don't have any 
 of those things, 
 There's nothing 
 wrong with me. 
 I don't understand. 
 I've never been 
 to this hospital before. 
 My name's not 
 Sharon Williams. 
 It's... Helen Kingsley. 
 I'm your mother. 
 WEAVER: 
 Who'd you say, Kovac? 
 Yeah. His wanting Saturday off 
 is potentially a problem. 
 Well, however 
 you want to handle it. 
 Kerry, they can take 
 Sharon Williams 
 for her chest x-ray now. 
 That won't be necessary. 
 You can cancel 
 her labs, too. 
 Cancel all of it? 
 Yeah. 
 Kerry, about earlier... 
 Susan, could you follow up 
 on this migraine in Two? 
 I know we were supposed to take 
 the screwdriver guy upstairs. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Dubenko wanted serial 
 crits and the UA 
 showed 10 red cells. 
 Do we need to work that up? 
 That's probably just 
 from the foley. 
 So he doesn't need a CT? 
 Frank, I'm gonna take a break. 
 What?! 
 ""Break""? 
 Well... they say it isn't 
 good for your arteries. 
 I guess you'd 
 know about that. 
 But I like it anyway. 
 How did you find me? 
 The letter you sent. 
 But that was four years ago. 
 Why-Why all this pretense? 
 Why didn't you 
 just write back? 
 I wanted to see you first. 
 That poor little 
 ice skater girl. 
 Her leg looked awful. 
 She's young. She'll heal. 
 What you do, 
 it's so important. 
 I guess I was scared. 
 I'm here in Chicago 
 for a week, so... 
 You're still in Indiana? 
 Terre Haute. 
 That's next door. 
 You could've been 
 to Chicago a hundred times. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I looked for you. 
 I hired an investigator. 
 I finally found 
 the right address, 
 you knew where I was and, 
 still, you waited so long? 
 I can't explain it. 
 I know it wasn't fair. 
 I'm truly, 
 truly sorry. 
 Oh, plea... please. 
 Please. Don't go yet. 
 So, um... have you 
 always lived in Indiana? 
 South Carolina, originally. 
 I'm here in Chicago 
 with my choir. 
 Your choir? 
 There's a Christ Crusade 
 and we were chosen to sing 
 in the festival chorus. 
 That... that sounds 
 like quite an honor. 
 When's the concert? 
 Tomorrow afternoon, 
 Community Baptist 
 on Dearborn. 
 Oh... as a matter of fact, 
 they're going to be 
 looking for me. 
 We've got a rehearsal. 
 Um... 
 I'd like to talk 
 to you again, Kerry. 
 If you want to, that is. 
 Yeah, I would. 
 So I can call you 
 after I'm done? 
 Do you have the number 
 of the hospital? 
 No. 
 Just wait one second. 
 There's a separate number 
 for the ER. 
 Uh... one second. 
 Here you go. 
 There you are. 
 So you'll call. 
 In a couple of hours. 
 Great. 
 Pressure's only 72 palp. 
 Left pupil 
 is 6 millimeters 
 and sluggish. 
 Hang 80 
 of mannitol. 
 Multiple rib fractures 
 with sub q air. 
 Glove up for a chest tube. 
 So, our drunk vs. screwdriver 
 is having some more trouble? 
 This isn't the screwdriver guy. 
 Oh, I heard he was still down 
 here, so naturally I assumed 
 there was some 
 emergent situation. 
 No. This would be 
 the motorcycle vs. tree guy. 
 Blunt head, chest... 
 Looks like a fractured spleen. 
 Mr. Scanlon, your 
 patient's bleeding 
 in the head and belly. 
 What's your plan? 
 Uh... quick head CT before going 
 to the OR for an exlap. 
 Good call if you want him 
 to bleed out in the scanner. 
 Betadine and steri-drape. 
 What's the Monroe-Kelly 
 hypothesis? 
 Uh, I don't know. 
 Abby? 
 I don't know. 
 CPP equals MAP minus ICP. 
 Cerebral Perfusion Pressure 
 equals Mean Arterial Pressure 
 minus Intracranial Pressure. 
 Spleen's a bigger threat 
 to the MAP. 
 Two units on the infuser. 
 Guidewire's ready. 
 Stop what 
 you're doing. 
 Have you even read 
 about this procedure? 
 I supervised Jake putting 
 in a chest tube last week. 
 Oh, good. Because 
 I'm sure you told him 
 you always insert a gloved 
 finger and feel lung tissue 
 before... 
 before inserting the tube. 
 Why is that, Mr. Scanlon? 
 Uh... 
 First, to break up 
 any adhesions. 
 Second, if there is a 
 diaphragmatic injury, 
 you could be in the abdominal 
 cavity and chest tubes 
 don't work very well 
 in the stomach. 
 Line is primed. 
 Kerry, I think we can 
 take this from here. 
 Uh... yes, I'm sure you can. 
 That was fun. 
 Would you like to tell me 
 why she's so pissed off 
 at the two of you? 
 Man, and I thought 
 I knew how to pimp. 
 When did your 
 neck pain start? 
 Came in from 
 Cleveland yesterday 
 to help my brother move. 
 I was lifting a chair. 
 She had an MRI 
 last year-- 
 three slipped disks 
 in her neck. 
 Any neuro findings? 
 Motor and sensory intact. 
 The pain goes down into her 
 arm, though. Don't forget that. 
 NEELA: 
 I was going to order 
 some morphine. 
 PATIENT: 
 Makes me sick 
 to my stomach. 
 HUSBAND: 
 Demerol's the only thing that 
 works when she gets like this. 
 We could try Toradol. 
 Allergic. 
 Demerol. 
 Okay, we will be right back. 
 Neck pain with radiculopathy 
 consistent with herniated 
 disk syndrome. 
 Allergic to Toradol-- 
 she may as well have told us 
 she's a Demerol addict. 
 We have no objective test 
 for pain. 
 Shouldn't we err on the side 
 of believing her? 
 Give her the Demerol 
 and get her out the door. 
 See what I mean? 
 She's on every case. 
 Looks good. 
 Did Dr. Pratt show the 
 two-layer repair? 
 Where is Dr. Pratt? 
 I think he's looking 
 for supplies. 
 Looking for supplies. 
 Didn't this woman have 
 her daughter with her? 
 That's where he is. 
 He's, uh, with the daughter. 
 He's helping her locate 
 a skilled 
 nursing facility. 
 CVP is 10, MAP is 80 
 and we're transfusing 
 to an SCV O2 of 70. 
 Once the crit is 30, 
 consider dopamine. 
 Dr. Pratt, is there some 
 good reason 
 why you've left your 
 student unsupervised? 
 Other patients? 
 Look, I've got a 75-year-old 
 man with urosepsis, 
 a woman in pulmonary edema 
 and a kid with anaphylaxis 
 from a peanut allergy. 
 And ""my student"" should 
 be supervised by an intern. 
 Except that I asked 
 you to do it. 
 You've got to stay 
 on these residents. 
 Dr. Pratt isn't the problem. 
 You know that break 
 you took? 
 You may want 
 to take another one. 
 Frank, have I gotten 
 any calls? 
 Nope. 
 You've been here 
 the whole time? 
 Yep. 
 I'm going out. 
 Carter, would you 
 take over 
 this bowel obstruction 
 in Four... 
 Retinoschisis in Two... 
 Mr. Langstaff with pyleo, 
 he's waiting 
 on an admit to medicine. 
 A 72 year-old female 
 with nausea 
 and I need an LP 
 on the fever in Six. 
 You're signing 
 out a spinal tap? 
 So much for every case. 
 ( choir crooning harmonies ) 
 ( choir continues ) 
 * Just as I am 
 * Without one plea 
 * But that Thy blood 
 was shed for me * 
 * And that Thou bidst 
 me come to Thee * 
 * O lamb of God 
 * I come 
 * I come. 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks, Ann. 
 ( all talking at once ) 
 Has it already 
 been two hours? 
 I, I just thought I'd catch 
 some of the rehearsal. 
 It was beautiful. 
 It stopped snowing. 
 I gotta get my coat. 
 Seems like a lot of people 
 brought their families. 
 I have two children-- 
 two other children. 
 Carl's 26. He 
 does something 
 with the county court system 
 that I don't understand, 
 and Lorie's a year 
 out of college. 
 Free spirit, 
 bouncing around. 
 And I'm... divorced. 
 I always had 
 this image of you 
 living somewhere with this 
 happily-ever-after family. 
 Ending the marriage was more 
 difficult than I imagined. 
 The church saved me, 
 gave me back my life. 
 Except for that 
 part of my life 
 that's taken up 
 with my business. 
 I own an auto parts store. 
 That's unusual. 
 I know. Nobody 
 can quite believe it. 
 But it was part of the 
 divorce settlement. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you. 
 Why do you need it? 
 You don't know? 
 Uh, congenital 
 hip dysplasia. 
 In common parlance, 
 it's a birth defect. 
 Birth defect? 
 Yes. 
 Something I gave you. 
 Well, well, there's really 
 no way to know. 
 It's not that clear-cut. 
 Helen? 
 I was thinking about 
 what you said, 
 about how I could've 
 been in Chicago 
 a hundred times, 
 why this time? 
 I think it's because 
 I just recently 
 got the news that 
 your daddy died. 
 Oh, no, my father 
 died years ago. 
 That's not who I mean. 
 Your other father. 
 His name was Cody Boone. 
 Should've been a character 
 in some old Western TV show. 
 We were 15. 
 Well, I was almost 15. 
 And that was in South Carolina? 
 Myrtle Beach. 
 My daddy had a 
 miniature golf course. 
 Cody worked there after school. 
 So what happened? 
 Nothing fancy. 
 I got pregnant. 
 All the parents pitched 
 a fit, and rightfully so. 
 And abortion wasn't legal. 
 Oh, I never would 
 have done that. 
 Back then they had these homes 
 for girls in my condition. 
 There was one up in Indiana 
 where my aunt lived, 
 so they sent me up there. 
 That's where you were born. 
 Did you ever want to keep me? 
 Oh, of course. 
 Cody and I had a whole plan. 
 He was gonna quit school, 
 get work. 
 There was a room over 
 his parents' garage 
 where we could live... 
 but in the end, 
 you're 14, 15, 
 you got no money. 
 So. 
 I came to believe 
 that the best thing for you 
 would be to be with people 
 who could care for you 
 and do things for you. 
 It was true, right? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, what 
 I mean is... 
 I know what you mean. 
 I had two 
 loving parents. 
 I was happy, 
 but even with that, it somehow 
 always... felt like rejection. 
 Does that make sense? 
 They took you so fast. 
 I never held you. 
 I never 
 even saw you, 
 and nobody ever told me 
 anything about the birth defect. 
 When I was a little girl, 
 I used to wonder 
 if that's why I was given away-- 
 not quite perfect. 
 All Jesus' children are perfect. 
 An-and my father, Cody, 
 he nev... he didn't go with you? 
 I never saw him again. 
 Ever? 
 But when you 
 heard he'd died... 
 Kinda pushed a 
 button, huh? 
 I guess I'd always 
 thought about him 
 over the years... 
 although not as much as 
 I thought about you. 
 ( beeping ) 
 Oh. 
 That would be work. 
 She's concerned, 
 and so am I. 
 I understand, 
 Mr. Bulowski. 
 The pain is still 
 in her neck. 
 And still in my arm. 
 Yes, I understand 
 that, too. 
 I thought that you were 
 going to help her. 
 Dr. Rasgotra? 
 Excuse me. 
 Mrs. Bulowski complained 
 that she was still in pain. 
 And you explained 
 to her that she 
 had already had her Demerol? 
 So she suckered 
 you into a second shot. 
 Well, one could look 
 at it that way. 
 Jerry, I'm back! 
 I didn't even know 
 you'd been gone. 
 Uh, Kerry, I hope 
 you don't take this 
 the wrong way but when 
 I said to take a break, 
 I didn't mean 
 it literally. 
 I didn't think I'd 
 be gone so long. 
 We're getting 
 slammed here. 
 Morris is out sick. 
 We're boarding ten 
 ICU patients. 
 We've got charts 
 in the rack for four hours, 
 12 patients on the board, 
 and we're 50 behind in triage. 
 You're back. 
 Yes. 
 Are you 
 going out again? 
 Yes. 
 Yes? 
 I irrigated 
 the obnoxious bald 
 guy with the head lac. 
 Got moved into Trauma Two. 
 I can take 
 that, Susan. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
 ABBY: 
 I don't know. 
 I don't understand. 
 JAKE: 
 Well, after I 
 explain, you will. 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 Kerry. 
 I was looking for some obnoxious 
 bald guy who needs suturing? 
 Yeah, he was 
 here, but... 
 We put him 
 next door. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 Do you work here? 
 My head is throbbing, 
 throbbing, 
 throbbing. 
 No one will 
 even give me 
 an aspirin. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 What the hell 
 is going on?! 
 Mr. Screwdriver, so 
 nice to see you again. 
 Okay, Kerry... 
 I-I, I take 
 full responsibility 
 for this patient 
 still being in the ER. 
 You don't think Dr. Dubenko 
 deserves just a soup√ßon of that? 
 He ordered an NG, a foley, 
 three serial crits 
 and a four-hour chest film. 
 I hear everything, 
 Mr. Scanlon. 
 She pretty much does. 
 So, do we have some hope 
 that this gentleman 
 will be sent upstairs 
 in, let's say-- our lifetime? 
 Ten minutes. 
 Thank you, and when you're done 
 with him, do the guy next door. 
 Does she have multiple 
 personalities? 
 You're not on, bro. 
 No, Dr. Morris has 
 failed to be on. 
 I was rather 
 unceremoniously 
 told to bring my ass 
 back in here. 
 Have you seen 
 Neela or Carter? 
 No. 
 Dr. Barnett, you 
 got your first case. 
 The well-fed, well-drugged 
 Bulowskis in Curtain Two. 
 Review the chart and 
 kick their asses out of here. 
 JANE: 
 They're both 
 good facilities. 
 Locked doors so 
 patients can't wander, 
 and the nursing staffs 
 are specially trained 
 in handling 
 dementia patients. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Jane? 
 Uh... Mrs. Devon's daughter, 
 the Pick's disease. 
 I was going over some of the 
 nursing facilities with her. 
 And Dr. Pratt, is 
 he even remotely 
 involved with this 
 patient anymore? 
 Yeah. We're 
 swamped, you know. 
 One of the docs 
 is out sick, 
 so he's been 
 really busy, 
 but he's involved. Sort of. 
 Wow. Wound edges 
 are everted nicely. 
 Excellent approximation. 
 Jane does good work. 
 Were you waiting on 
 a Unasyn piggyback? 
 Yeah, thanks, Haleh. 
 Don't worry, I got this. 
 Okay. Okay, I get it, 
 Mrs. Devon, but please, 
 do not play with 
 the Kleenex box, all right? 
 All right. 
 You know what? 
 4:30 and it's already dark. 
 Winter. 
 You really are 
 leaving, aren't you? 
 You know that patient 
 who was here this morning, 
 Sharon Williams? 
 Yeah. 
 She wasn't really 
 a patient. 
 Yeah? 
 Do you remember when I was 
 looking for my birth mother? 
 Oh, my God. You found her? 
 She found me. 
 Kerry... 
 Oh, I'm so happy for you. 
 Is it weird? 
 There's a lot to take in. 
 I mean, there are certain things 
 that she's told me, and... 
 there are a lot of things 
 I still have to tell her. 
 I gotta go. 
 I'm going to go home 
 and change, and, uh, 
 I'm gonna go have some dinner. 
 Well, yeah. Don't worry about 
 this place. We'll be fine. 
 I'll try to stop by later. 
 Susan, thanks. 
 You said you 
 had pictures 
 of some relatives? 
 I want to hear 
 about Africa. 
 Okay, we lived there 
 when I was little. 
 The adoption people 
 said the family, 
 your family, 
 were involved in the church. 
 Were they actually 
 missionaries? 
 More like wannabe 
 missionaries. 
 My-my mom worked to 
 set up new schools 
 and my dad was 
 a civil engineer. 
 He taught me how 
 to build a canal, 
 not that I've had 
 much use for that. 
 Well, did you like 
 living over there? 
 I was different simply 
 for being white. 
 No one seemed to even 
 notice the crutch, 
 and then... my parents 
 were older. 
 Their health wasn't so great, 
 so we moved back 
 to Minneapolis 
 when I was 12, and 
 they both passed away 
 when I was in college. 
 So they never got to see 
 you become a doctor? 
 Mm-mm. 
 Oh. 
 They would have been 
 so proud of you. 
 I'm proud of you. 
 My biggest regret is that 
 they never got to 
 meet their grandson. 
 You have a family? 
 Uh, my son... Henry. 
 He's named after my dad. 
 There he is. 
 Oh, my heavens, 
 what a little doll. 
 13 months. 
 Oh, that's a handful. 
 Between him 
 and a full-time job, 
 no wonder you need a nanny. 
 Is your husband a doctor, too? 
 I'm alone now. 
 There was an accident. 
 Oh, my God, Kerry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Was it recent? 
 Last year. 
 Oh, Kerry. My dear Kerry. 
 We are tested, 
 but the Lord gives us strength. 
 I can only imagine 
 how difficult this has been. 
 But you have 
 to have faith. 
 Paul wrote 
 in Romans 8: 
 ""I am convinced 
 that neither death nor life, 
 ""nor angels nor rulers, 
 ""nor things present, 
 nor things to come 
 ""can separate us 
 from the love of God 
 in Christ Jesus, our Lord."" 
 ( sighs ) 
 ( taking deep breaths ) 
 Are you waiting? 
 What? 
 Oh, no, go ahead. 
 ( sighs ) 
 This is my Uncle Jackson. 
 Loved stealing cars. 
 Just had 
 a real passion for it. 
 Do you have any pictures 
 of my father? 
 Just one. 
 When I was away 
 in Indiana, Cody drove 
 all the way up to see me. 
 Didn't even have 
 a license yet. 
 For the life of me, 
 I don't know 
 what we thought 
 we had to smile about. 
 This is my family, Helen. 
 This woman's name 
 is Sandy Lopez, 
 and she's not my nanny. 
 She was my partner. 
 Your partner. 
 My lover, my wife. 
 The mother of my child. 
 She was a firefighter, 
 and she died last year. 
 You're gay? 
 Yes. 
 I wanted to tell you earlier, 
 but I was afraid. 
 My mom and dad died before 
 I came to accept it, 
 so I never got a chance 
 to tell them. 
 Uh... 
 uh, so they never knew 
 you made this choice. 
 It's not a choice. 
 It's who I am, 
 who I was born as. 
 Will you pray with me? 
 No. No. I am not 
 gonna do this. 
 Kerry, please... 
 Kerry... 
 HELEN: 
 I didn't mean to offend you. 
 I was just so glad 
 to find you. 
 And my being gay 
 changes that? 
 This is who I am. 
 It's wrong, Kerry. 
 I knew this was a mistake. 
 It's not what 
 God created. 
 Why are people like you 
 always saying things like that? 
 Why are people like you 
 so dismissive of 
 people of faith? 
 Because you have no faith 
 that God knew 
 what he was doing, 
 that God created me, too. 
 God did create you 
 and He loves you. 
 What is it about us 
 that is so much more threatening 
 than all the really terrible 
 things in the world? 
 Don't dismiss me 
 so easily, Kerry. 
 People are starving, 
 people are being shot at, 
 men are flying planes 
 into buildings, 
 yet the faithful are saying, 
 ""Watch out for those lesbians, 
 they're gonna destroy 
 our God-gifted lives."" 
 Well, the world 
 isn't perfect, it's 
 what we make it. 
 You just finished telling me 
 how perfect it was. 
 That neither life nor death, 
 angels nor rulers 
 can separate us 
 from the love of God 
 in Christ Jesus, our Lord. 
 I know the words, Helen, 
 I was raised in the church. 
 Then you know it's 
 healing mission. 
 Except that the welcome sign's 
 not out for everyone, is it? 
 Do you hate all faith? 
 No. No, of course not. 
 I hate that my own faith 
 now excludes me, 
 tries to tell me I'm a sinner 
 because of the people I love. 
 It's the people 
 you've chosen to love. 
 I have made a choice: 
 to stop living a lie 
 about who I am. 
 I was alone in my soul. 
 Do you know 
 what that feels like? 
 My... my hotel's nearby. 
 I think I'll walk. 
 They won't budge. 
 And I called Cleveland Memorial. 
 She goes there twice a week 
 asking for Demerol. 
 She's in their 
 turkey files. 
 We're not gonna cure her habit 
 by denying her dr*gs today. 
 Just kick her out, please? 
 Weaver's gonna be pissed. 
 Watch and learn. 
 Mrs. Bulowski... 
 I understand you're still 
 experiencing some pain. 
 It's better, but I think 
 one more shot of Demerol 
 would really do it. 
 You've already 
 had two. 
 Hey. 
 CARTER: 
 Well, the problem is, 
 is that 
 when you use it regularly, 
 as... I think that you do, 
 it doesn't work as well, 
 and you can grow 
 dependent on it. 
 Are you saying that my wife 
 is some kind of drug addict? 
 You don't know 
 what real pain is. 
 I'm not sure that's really fair. 
 MR. BULOWSKI: 
 What do you know 
 about fair? 
 Mr. Bulowski. 
 You think it's fair 
 that my wife has 
 this kind of pain? 
 You said you would 
 bring her another shot, 
 and you never came back. 
 Mr. Bulowski... 
 I'm not talking to you! 
 Jerry, call Security. 
 You like stringing 
 people along, is that it? 
 Okay, you need to... 
 Will you get the 
 hell away from me?! 
 ( grunting ) 
 RAY: 
 Come on! 
 ( Mrs. Bulowski grunting ) 
 Get him off of me! 
 Beth! Come on, Beth! 
 Where the hell are you? 
 Beth! Beth! 
 Get him off of me, Beth! 
 ( bedpan clangs ) 
 ( panicked shouts continue ) 
 What the hell am I doing? 
 ( grunting ) 
 Who's winning? 
 Neela was about to deck 
 somebody with a bedpan. 
 JERRY: 
 I've always wanted to see 
 something like that. 
 Hard to let go of a 
 dream, isn't it, Jerry? 
 So, are we under control? 
 Yeah, I'd say so. 
 Thought you were gone 
 for the day. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
 Charlotte? Charlotte? 
 It's okay, she's gonna be 
 right back, Mrs. Devon. 
 Hey, where's her daughter? 
 She had to pick up 
 her kids. 
 What's she doing? 
 Is the roast... 
 is the roast going 
 to be ready? 
 Don't worry, 
 the roast is gonna be 
 just fine, okay? 
 She's folding napkins 
 for her dinner party. 
 The literature says that, 
 generally, you shouldn't play 
 into this kind 
 of delusional thinking, 
 but I don't really 
 get the point of that 
 in this case, do you? 
 You got this? 
 I think so. 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 What's going on with 
 the Pick's Disease? 
 Found a bed 
 for her tonight. 
 Her daughter managed 
 a placement, 
 but they won't be able 
 to take her till tomorrow. 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, I just wanted you 
 to know that, um, 
 I'm willing to have Jane 
 assigned to me anytime. 
 I'll bet. She's good. 
 ( chuckles ): 
 Yeah, no kidding. 
 Hey, so, did you hear? 
 They're bringing in 
 a fisherman vs. horse. 
 Vs. horse? 
 Yeah, I know. 
 You'd think 
 it'd be vs. fish, 
 which doesn't make sense, 
 either, but... 
 Go. 
 Hey, Kerry. 
 Hey. Aren't you in 
 a little early? 
 An hour. But with Sam on days 
 and me on nights, 
 we're just trying to steal 
 a moment when we can. 
 Have a good night. 
 Thanks. 
 Good evening. 
 Can I help you? 
 Helen? 
 Helen? 
 ( muttering ): 
 That's the wrong... 
 They tell you 
 the coffee's free. 
 ( chuckles ): 
 You just got to pay for 
 the room, that's all. 
 You think about a day like this 
 for a long time. 
 You play out every scenario 
 in your head. 
 Except for this one. 
 Is it because 
 I gave you up? 
 No. No, of course not. 
 Is it because 
 I didn't come looking for you 
 for so many years? 
 You don't get to paint 
 the whole picture 
 yourself, Helen. 
 Feel guilty because 
 you gave up a child, 
 and then... 
 get all warm and 
 fuzzy because it 
 turned out all right: 
 she had a good family, 
 became a doctor. 
 If you're disappointed, 
 it should be 
 with the limitations 
 of your faith, 
 not in the way 
 that I've lived my life. 
 I gave birth to a child 
 who I abandoned. 
 For all the right reasons, 
 they told me. 
 But I thought about you. 
 And I came to realize 
 that by giving you up, 
 I'd broken my own heart. 
 And faith is the only thing 
 that gave me hope. 
 Gave me courage. 
 I can't abandon it, too. 
 Can you accept me for who I am? 
 I can love you, 
 whoever you are. 
 I don't want love 
 without acceptance. 
 It was so good 
 to finally meet you.

 What? 
 Broke a rib. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't know,

 Why didn't you go

 He is the police. 
 A compass? 
 Seeing as how we always 
 find each other. 
 Can we talk? 
 What? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 What are you doing? 
 Christmas was 
 three weeks ago. 
 I figured it's time 
 to put it away. 
 Leave it. I like it. 
 You want to be one 
 of those people 
 dragging some dead brown 
 tree out into the street 
 in the middle of April? 
 I like those people. 
 They don't give up easy. 
 I made this for Maggie 
 when I was... 
 I think, six. 
 We were living in a motel: 
 the Minnetonka. 
 Don't you have a search 
 committee meeting this morning? 
 I could skip it. 
 We can talk some more. 
 No, you should go. 
 I have to be 
 in soon, so... 
 I guess we haven't figured 
 anything out yet. 
 Yeah, I really... 
 don't want 
 to get into it again. 
 Have you made a decision? 
 Well, we don't even know 
 what we are to each other. 
 No one ever knows that. 
 Oh, come on. 
 We've been friends 
 for a long time. 
 Good friends. 
 Yeah. 
 Been through a lot together. 
 That doesn't mean 
 we could take care of a child. 
 It has to be your choice. 
 I know that.

 I'm not even on today. 
 Guys, easy, easy. 
 Look, she had a nasty little 
 slip on the ice, 
 so let's give her 
 some space. 
 Okay? 
 Thank you. 
 All right, what? 
 What, what? 
 What do you want? 
 I need a few weeks off. 
 Why? 
 My band got a recording deal. 
 We're going to L.A.

 with my crutch. 
 Kerry... 
 Back off, Elvis. 
 Ah! This damn salt 
 ruined my shoes. 
 Yeah, well, New York's 
 been snow-free all year. 
 Why don't you go back there? 
 These are Jimmy Choos. 
 Timmy who, and why are 
 you wearing his shoes? 
 Choos and they cost me 
 about 400 bucks. 
 A: Number one: you 
 shouldn't be wearing shoes 
 that cost more than 
 other people's rent, 
 and B: Number two: 
 it's January in Chicago. 
 Get some damn boots. 
 Hey, let me 
 tell you something, Vic. 
 You're not a morning person. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Hey, excuse me. 
 Can I get some 
 more coffee please, 
 and some Splenda, 
 about a fistful? 
 What? 
 Shut up. 
 All I'm saying is you're 
 not really prepared 
 for winter here, are you? 
 So? 
 So? 
 So? 
 ( chuckles ) 
 So, so, so why don't you 
 stay at my place today? 
 ( laughs ) 
 I want to see Michigan Avenue. 
 All right, fine, just 
 don't buy it, will you? 
 I can shop 
 if I want to here. 
 On whose credit card? 
 ( groans ) 
 ( chuckles ) 
 You're still worried 
 about Bobby. 
 I told you 
 that I severed 
 all ties with him. 
 Just because you severed 
 all ties with Bobby 
 doesn't mean he severed 
 all ties with you, okay? 
 He has no idea 
 where I went. 
 No, of course not. 
 He has no idea. 
 Of course, he would never think 
 of you being with me. 
 He doesn't know where you are. 
 No, no. 
 He's a freakin' cop. 
 How hard you think that is, huh? 
 What, are you stupid? 
 How stupid 
 do you have to be? 
 What? 
 Give me some money. 
 What for? 
 For a cab. 
 Give me some money. 
 Oh, come on. Don't do this. 
 Don't be ridiculous, okay? 
 Just don't. 
 Give me the money. 
 Yeah, I need another 20. 
 Come on. 
 Don't do this. 
 And you know what 
 you should think about? 
 Don't touch me. 
 You should think about 
 getting into 
 some meditation classes 
 or maybe some Pilates 
 or something, 
 because you, Vic, 
 are getting very ugly. 
 And I mean that in the most 
 metaphorical sense, okay? 
 Come on, don't 
 walk away mad. 
 ( laughs ) 
 What? Now I got to go get myself 
 some boots, you jerk-off. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Come back here. Jody? 
 I'm sorry, I'm having trouble 
 clearing a bed. 
 You know, this really 
 isn't necessary. 
 I'm sure I can 
 get to my office. 
 Oh, you should let me 
 examine you. 
 All right. 
 Just treat me like 
 any other patient. 
 You sure? 
 Yeah. Get me out 
 of the hall. 
 Neela, let's run the board. 
 I have to take 
 my broken hip lady... 
 Hey! Not broken. 
 EMT Ted Cunningham, 23. 
 Lost his Shiley 
 at the nursing home. 
 Found him cyanotic, 
 put a 7-O in the neck. 
 Okay, Pratt, 
 go with them. 
 WOMAN: 
 He had a lot of mucus. 
 We tried to suction him, 
 but his trach tube came out 
 and he turned blue. 
 You from the home? 
 No, I'm his mother. 
 Ted, can you open your eyes? 
 He can't follow commands. 
 Okay, excuse us. 
 PRATT: 
 NG tube and a #6 Shiley. 
 94 and 15 liters. 
 He needs an NG? 
 You use it as a guide 
 to change the airway. 
 How long has he been like this? 
 Two years. 
 Ever since the night 
 he turned 21. 
 His friends took him to a bar 
 and made him drink 21 sh*ts. 
 On the way home, 
 he stepped into traffic 
 and got clipped 
 by a pickup truck. 
 You spend your whole life 
 raising a kid right, and then 
 one... stupid night 
 turns him into this. 
 LUKA: 
 Where are you? 
 It's time 
 to open the presents. 
 Just making sure. 
 Well, I think 
 you can stop now. 
 We could find a way 
 to make it work. 
 If that's what you want. 
 I don't know 
 what I want. 
 I am 37 years old. 
 If not now, when? 
 You know how I feel 
 about it. 
 Everything happens 
 for a reason. 
 It scares me, Luka. 
 Having it 
 or choosing not to? 
 Yeah. 
 PRATT: 
 Pull the NG and bag him. 
 Abby. 
 Bag him. 
 Is he all right? 
 He should be much better 
 now that he has a new tube. 
 Thank you. 
 PRATT: 
 Sats up to 99. 
 What's Coburn doing here? 
 Oh. Kovac's got her down 
 on this lady 
 with ovarian torsion. 
 Someone seems to 
 have left this. 
 So... how's 
 married life? 
 It's very nice, 
 thank you. 
 We're looking for a place 
 of our own. 
 That sounds exciting. 
 The army wants Michael 
 to finish his residency 
 at a military hospital. 
 And where's the 
 closest program? 
 Fort Hood, Texas. 
 I'm hoping he can end up 
 somewhere not too far away. 
 Tenderness over 
 the greater trochanter? 
 Yeah, it's probably 
 just a contusion 
 from where I hit the ground. 
 I'm going to check 
 your range of motion. 
 Ow! 
 Oh, God. 
 Pain with internal rotation. 
 You know. 
 That's happened before. 
 I just need an ice pack 
 for ten minutes, 
 and it'll stop. 
 And something 
 for the pain, perhaps? 
 Percocet, Vicodin? 
 No. No, I have 
 too much work to do. 
 800 of ibuprofen, and 
 call for a hip series. 
 Well, I'll have to run it 
 past my attending fir... 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hey, pull the 
 curtain, please. 
 How's she doing? 
 A bit cranky 
 at the moment. 
 Yeah, well, you'll soften 
 her up for me, right? 
 What? 
 For my TO request. 
 What do you need 
 time off for? 
 Neela, do you know 
 who Barry Ginsberg is? 
 Gynecologist 
 on fourth floor? 
 No. No, he's 
 a record producer, 
 a mogul, an idol-maker. 
 He took a listen to 
 a couple of tracks 
 my boys laid down, 
 and, bang, we are 
 going to L.A., 
 and we have a gig 
 at the Key Club. 
 And if all goes well, 
 we get to record a demo 
 at his studio in Venice. 
 Italy? 
 California, on the beach. 
 Congratulations, Ray. 
 That's really awesome. 
 Here, super-infected 
 foot fungus in Four. 
 Uh, only thing is I'm going 
 to need a little time off. 
 How much is a little? 
 Eh, just a month. 
 That's not a little. 
 Hey, can you check out 
 this patient for me? 
 Amanda Ramsey, 15, 
 presented with vague pain. 
 I'm sorry, I have 
 to get some ibuprofen 
 and a hip series 
 for Dr. Weaver. 
 Please? 
 I'll trade you. 
 I didn't tell her yet. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 Amanda, I'm 
 Dr. Rasgotra. 
 How much longer 
 do you think it'll be? 
 'Cause I didn't mean 
 to make a big deal. 
 I probably just need some Motrin 
 or something. 
 We ran a test 
 on your urine. 
 Do I have a bladder infection? 
 You're pregnant. 
 Did you know that? 
 You didn't tell my parents, 
 did you? 
 They've been told 
 that you were here, 
 but that's all. 
 Who's the father? 
 Some guy from school. 
 Boyfriend? 
 No. 
 I can get our 
 adolescent clinic 
 to come down 
 and talk to you. 
 No, my parents won't like that. 
 There are a number 
 of options. 
 Yeah, I can keep it, 
 or put it up for adoption. 
 Or you could choose 
 not to have it. 
 I could never do that. 
 It'd be against God. 
 They stabbed me in the heart! 
 PP Perkins, 
 mugging victim. 
 They stabbed me... 
 s*ab wounds to 
 the chest, arms 
 and abdomen. 
 His name's PP? 
 I got blood coming out 
 everywhere! 
 He's only satting 82. 
 You guys need a hand? 
 No, we're on it. 
 Chest tube in here. Come on now. 
 Come on, let's move it! 
 Okay, we're gonna need 
 to remove an ovary, Sara, 
 but that's why 
 God gave you a spare. 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 Um, prep her in two. 
 I should be up in... 
 15 minutes. 
 How's it going? 
 Oh, well, good. 
 She's young, 
 and the other ovary 
 looks good, so... 
 Uh, no, I-I meant... 
 Oh, ""How's it going?"" 
 Oh, well, fine. You? 
 Good. 
 I just got paged 
 for an ultrasound. 
 Do you know anything 
 about that? 
 Uh, no. No. 
 Um, but I remember hearing 
 that you started 
 your own practice? 
 Yeah, yeah. 
 It's going, uh, 
 very well, you know. 
 The only problem's 
 the boss. 
 Ooh, what a bitch. 
 I'm the boss, Abby. 
 Right. 
 ( laughs ) 
 ( laughs ): 
 Now you're 
 patronizing me. 
 No. I... um... 
 I just... 
 I just, uh, might want 
 to come and see you. 
 I need an OB. 
 ( gasps ): 
 Congratulations. 
 Wow. I had no idea. 
 I'll shut up. 
 Yeah. It wasn't 
 something I expected. 
 Is it something you want? 
 I'm not sure 
 I'm at the right place 
 in my life for this, so... 
 So, you don't want 
 to keep it? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 Okay. I'm always prepared. 
 Yeah. 
 Thanks. 
 ( sniffles ) 
 Listen, um, I've got 
 office hours every afternoon. 
 Just come by any time. 
 I can help you, 
 whether it's prenatal care 
 or termination, 
 whatever you decide. 
 Thank you. 
 And whatever you do, Abby-- 
 it's gonna be 
 the right thing. 
 Thanks. 
 ( quietly ): 
 Oh, God. 
 Systolic's only 86. 
 Almost there. Get the thoraseal. 
 Okay, a little pressure now. 
 All right, so who really 
 jacked you, PP? 
 It was some-some guys 
 I know, man. 
 Sats coming up. 
 We was drinking 
 by this fire in this alley. 
 Right. Must be some real 
 good friends; they avoided 
 stabbing you in 
 the heart, huh? 
 Hey, Malik, 
 did somebody call the cops? 
 Yeah, they're on their way. 
 Don't call no cops. 
 I'm sure they're rushing 
 right over right now. 
 No cops, man. 
 BP's better: 110/75. 
 No cops? These guys 
 could have k*lled you. 
 Yeah, I got 
 problems, yo. 
 I got problems. 
 Cops only gonna make it worse. 
 I feel you, bro. 
 Trust me, I feel you. 
 Then do me a solid, man. 
 Anything for you, PP. Anything. 
 More lube. 
 It's cold. 
 Oh, sorry about that. 
 ( sighs ): 
 Dr. Coburn. 
 I called OB. 
 AMANDA: 
 Could there have been a mistake 
 with that other test? 
 COBURN: 
 Mm, I don't think so. 
 Here. You see this? 
 That's the 
 heart beating. 
 ( sighs ) 
 It's about seven weeks old, 
 I'd say. 
 They won't understand. 
 Your parents? 
 They'll say I've sinned. 
 I can help you talk 
 to them if you want. 
 Can I have 
 a minute? 
 You were in with a patient, so 
 I thought it was best to just... 
 Yeah. It would 
 be better if you 
 presented to me first. 
 Well, either way, 
 I had to call an OB. 
 She's 15 and scared. 
 Family on the way in? 
 They're very religious people. 
 Call me when 
 they get here. 
 LOCKHART: 
 How'd you do this? 
 Tried to hop a bus. 
 Did you slip on the ice? 
 I was skitching. 
 Fell off the fender. 
 Ah. 
 Might be easier 
 just to pay the fare. 
 Do I look like I got 
 surplus income to blow? 
 Can I get 
 another 3-0 ethilon? 
 Were you, uh, 
 on your way home? 
 I haven't been 
 home in a while. 
 Since, like, May. 
 Well, your folks must be worried 
 about you. 
 Yeah, they worry a lot. 
 Always wanting to know what 
 I'm doing, what I'm up to. 
 Gets to be a real 
 drag, you know. 
 Doesn't sound so bad. 
 I'm an independent spirit, 
 you know? 
 I want to be on my own. 
 Do they even know where you are? 
 No. 
 Just left one day. 
 What if I don't know 
 how to love it right? 
 KOVAC: 
 Abby. 
 ( Kovac sighs ) 
 Maybe I'm not strong enough. 
 Being a parent 
 makes you stronger. 
 And it breaks your heart. 
 You told me that. 
 That's not what I meant. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean... 
 No. Don't-Don't use that 
 as a reason. 
 ( exhales ) 
 I'm sorry. 
 ( sniffles ) 
 What if I go shopping and 
 leave it in the supermarket? 
 Don't worry. 
 I'll do all the shopping. 
 ( exhales heavily ) 
 I'm afraid I'd 
 mess it up, Luka. 
 ( exhales loudly ) 
 We won't. 
 Okay, um... 
 keep the wound clean and dry, 
 come back in a week 
 to have the stitches removed. 
 That's it? 
 Yeah. 
 Unless you want to talk 
 to somebody from social work. 
 Your daughter's right in here. 
 Mandy, are you okay? 
 I'm fine, Mom. 
 I'll, uh, leave you 
 all to talk. 
 Could you stay? 
 Sure. 
 Mom... 
 Daddy... 
 something happened, 
 and, um... 
 I'm real sorry. 
 What happened, 
 sweetie? 
 We ran a test 
 and did an ultrasound. 
 Amanda's pregnant. 
 We're waiting for 
 some blood results. 
 As soon as 
 they arrive... 
 That's fine. 
 There are a number 
 of places 
 we can refer you to 
 for counseling. 
 We'd like to be alone 
 with our daughter now. 
 Thank you. 
 No free fluid on ultrasound, 
 waiting on surgery 
 to evaluate. 
 Not anymore, Red. 
 What have you got? 
 Morning, 
 sunshine. 
 Who are you? 
 Clemente. Who are you? 
 I'm surgery. 
 See the badge? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 You must be the 
 bedside manner coach 
 I heard so much about. 
 Uh, multiple s*ab wounds-- 
 stable after the chest tube. 
 Anything enter the peritoneum? 
 Uh, not sure. 
 Ultrasound's negative. 
 Doesn't answer my question. 
 Hey, I got the cops 
 out here. 
 Relax, relax. 
 I got your back. 
 If you can get a smile 
 out of surgery here, 
 I'll pay for the date. 
 You're right on 
 the cusp of sexual 
 harassment, Clemente. 
 The cusp. 
 That would be a new position 
 for me. 
 Hey, guys. 
 I'm the attending physician 
 on this case. 
 Clemente? 
 Yeah. 
 Now, the thing is, 
 this dude is very sick. 
 He's out of it, 
 completely out of it. 
 So, he's not gonna be able 
 to give a statement today, okay? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hold on a sec. 
 You're Victor Clemente? 
 Yeah. Were you listening 
 to me? 
 He's not gonna be able to 
 give you a statement. I'm sorry. 
 Easy... We're not 
 here on your patient. 
 We're here for you.

 on a consult. 
 Albright? 
 MORRIS: 
 He's hemodynamically stable 
 with no peritoneal signs. 
 So why'd you 
 call me? 
 Look, missy, 
 it's protocol, all right? 
 You didn't really just 
 call me missy, did you? 
 Okay, look, the-the case meets 
 trauma criteria. 
 Next time, call me when you know 
 what you got in your hands. 
 Are you Dr. 
 Albright? 
 He was stabbed in the belly. 
 I need to know 
 if he needs surgical repair. 
 Neela Rasgotra. I 
 heard you were here. 
 I wanted to catch 
 you about doing a 
 surgery elective? 
 Right. 
 Work up your patient. 
 Image the belly, 
 explore the wounds, figure 
 out how deep they are. 
 If they enter 
 the peritoneal 
 cavity, call me. 
 I'll be more than happy 
 to get involved. 
 One third of s*ab 
 wounds enter the 
 peritoneal cavity 
 and damage the viscera. 
 One third go in, and 
 don't hit anything. 
 And one third... 
 are shallow and tangential. 
 The trajectory was suggested 
 by the hilt mark of the knife. 
 He won't need surgery. 
 You should pay 
 more attention to 
 your interns, Red. 
 I'm an R2, actually. 
 Okay, R2. 
 Call me about 
 that elective. 
 We might be able to 
 work something out. 
 Ooh, hoo. 
 Parking violations. Come on, 
 you got to be kidding me, right? 
 Okay. But you had 
 some other problems 
 back East, didn't you? 
 What kind of problems 
 you talking about? 
 You left Newark General 
 under some very 
 serious allegations. 
 I never... I never, never, never 
 compromised a patient's care. 
 Do you understand me? 
 I never... 
 ( laughs ): 
 Okay, okay. 
 Let's just get back 
 to Mrs. Kenyon. 
 She had some issues... 
 What do you want me to say? 
 Issues? What issues? 
 She had no issues. 
 She was a nurse. 
 I'd ask her for 6-0 Vicryl, 
 and she'd bring it to me. 
 No issues. 
 Can I go now? 
 Thank you. 
 Not yet. 
 All right, you... 
 all right, you do realize 
 that son of bitch hits her, 
 right? 
 So, you have seen her? 
 You realize that? 
 No, I haven't seen her. 
 But I can see what's going on 
 here, and it's pretty low. 
 To sic you on me 
 'cause he can't keep 
 his own wife happy. 
 That's pretty pathetic. 
 Right now, 
 all we know is, 
 Mrs. Kenyon's a 
 missing person who 
 might be in trouble. 
 Well, she'll be in more trouble 
 if you find her. 
 Meaning what? 
 Meaning, sometimes 
 people go missing 
 because they feel safer 
 that way. 
 My advice to you: 
 stop looking for her. 
 Well, don't you 
 go missing, 
 okay, Vic? 'Cause I want 
 to talk to you. 
 Why would I go missing? 
 Why would I go missing? Why? 
 Are you confusing me for one of 
 your lowlife, fascist scumbags 
 you spend your days with? 
 Hey, you might want 
 to settle down 
 before it gets 
 embarrassing, huh? 
 You know, I hope 
 this conversation 
 doesn't throw me 
 off my game today, 
 especially after all 
 the cops' lives I've saved, 
 I'd hate to be less than 100% 
 when one of your brothers 
 comes in with a b*llet 
 through his belly. 
 I think we're 
 done for now. 
 Take it easy. 
 ( panting ) 
 Hey, we got any 
 loperamide in stock? 
 Yeah, I'm sure he has. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Well, I got you 
 the good stuff. 
 Today was... 
 Hey. 
 Oop, sorry. 
 It's turkey day 
 in the cafeteria. 
 No. 
 No what? 
 Is the answer to your question. 
 Can I at least state 
 my case first? 
 Okay. 
 This is big. 
 This is a big 
 opportunity 
 for my band 
 and for me. 
 And you never know 
 when you're going to get 
 another shot like this 
 My recollection is that 
 you were warned last year 
 about your commitment 
 to this job. 
 Yes, I was. 
 And to your credit, 
 you've done an excellent job 
 showing us that 
 you want to be here. 
 I do. 
 You're a good doctor. 
 Thank you. 
 We don't need to discuss this 
 any further. 
 You're valuable, 
 you're valued. 
 Conversation over. 
 Have you tried 
 the stuffing? 
 It's great stuffing. 
 And, you know, I got you 
 an extra piece... 
 Dr. Barnett. 
 Look, Kerry... 
 Dr. Weaver. 
 Um... 
 Have you ever dreamed 
 about something 
 without ever believing 
 it would actually happen? 
 Because that's 
 what this is. 
 I've... 
 This is so huge to me 
 that if I couldn't do this, 
 I would seriously 
 consider quitting. 
 Far be it from me to stand in 
 the way of the next Springsteen 
 or K.C. and 
 the Sunshine Band. 
 Resignation accepted. 
 What? 
 Why do you want 
 to do surgery anyway? 
 I'm curious about it. 
 The hours suck, 
 the attendings 
 are sl*ve drivers, 
 and the residents s*ab 
 each other in the back. 
 Oh, not like down here 
 where we're just 
 one big, happy family. 
 What's wrong with you? 
 Ashlee Simpson get caught 
 lip-synching again? 
 I think I just quit. 
 Quit? 
 To go to California 
 with my band. 
 Oh, great. Yeah. 
 No, bold move. 
 I like it. 
 Keeping that 
 music dream alive. 
 Nah, you'll love 
 California. 
 Everybody-- 
 Ray Barnett, 
 rock god! 
 Morris, I've already sent 
 my paperwork up to surgery. 
 Well, get it back. 
 I can't spare you, 
 especially now, 
 with Ray 
 on his way out. 
 If we're not 
 fully staffed, 
 you're not going 
 anywhere. 
 I don't care what 
 Dr. Cruella says. 
 Um... 3:45. 
 That'll work. 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Ray's on his way out? 
 Yeah, just 
 up and quit, 
 not going to let The Man 
 keep him down. 
 I don't think 
 he meant to. 
 Hey, guys? 
 Guys, guys, come here. 
 You know the girl 
 I been hanging out with? 
 Jodie? 
 Yeah, we love Jodie. 
 She taught me 
 how to tie a knot 
 in a cherry stem 
 using only my tongue. 
 Really? 
 All right, come on, 
 come on, guys. 
 Anybody ask 
 for her? 
 No. 
 You never saw her, okay? 
 And is anybody asks, 
 the same goes for me. 
 What? 
 Pretend you never 
 heard of me. 
 Lockhart, Pratt's 
 bringing in a patient. 
 Get with him, okay? 
 Okay. 
 He gets weirder every day. 
 Look, Morris, 
 you heard what 
 Dr. Albright said... 
 So what? She's the 
 chief resident upstairs. 
 I'm the chief down here. 
 You work for me. 
 Oh, come on. 
 That's not fair. 
 Fair? What's fair? 
 Excuse me, Doctor? 
 Mr. Ramsey. 
 I can sign 
 whatever I need to 
 and we'll 
 get out of your way. 
 Would you like me to call anyone 
 for further treatment? 
 Thank you. I think we'll arrange 
 our own prenatal care. 
 Amanda decided 
 to keep it? 
 The, uh... baby. 
 It's just that 
 she's young, 
 and it was 
 an accident. 
 No. No. 
 I don't believe in accidents. 
 Now, I know you may not 
 understand this, 
 but it is God's will 
 for her to have this child. 
 I only mean, you may want to 
 consider the long-term effects. 
 And you might want to consider 
 the spiritual effects 
 of what you're suggesting. 
 It's my job to make sure 
 the patient understands 
 all the options 
 available to her. 
 A human life has 
 just been created, 
 and, I'm sorry, but anything 
 that interferes with that 
 is morally indefensible. 
 MAN ( weakly ): 
 Finished a cycle of chemo 
 two days ago. 
 BARDELLI: 
 Couldn't get an IV. 
 He's too dry. 
 MARQUEZ: 
 Pratt? OR needs 
 an attending to sign off 
 on your pancreatic 
 pseudo cyst. 
 Where's Clemente? 
 On the roof. 
 We getting 
 a chopper patient? 
 No. He just says that 
 his cell phone 
 gets better reception 
 up there. 
 All right, 
 place a subclavian 
 and bolus him. 
 I'll be back. 
 Okay. 
 Triple lumen tray 
 and 1% lido. 
 He's tachy 
 at 132. 
 Little bit cold here. 
 I was never the sickly type, 
 you know? 
 Yeah? 
 Always very healthy. 
 Used to do triathlons, 
 you believe that? 
 Me, too. 
 Really? 
 Smoking, drinking 
 and watching TV. 
 You should stop that. 
 I have. 
 Six years ago, 
 I find out I inherited 
 the Philadelphia chromosome. 
 Ran on my mother's 
 side of the family. 
 I never knew. 
 Screwed by 
 genetics. 
 LOCKHART: 
 The first time, 
 I was panicked 
 the baby would be bipolar. 
 And I'm not so sure 
 I've changed that much. 
 KOVAC: 
 Well, the chances 
 are slim, 
 you know that. 
 Crossing the street 
 is a risk. 
 If you let it 
 get to you, 
 you'd never 
 have children. 
 Nobody would. 
 Well, maybe some people 
 aren't supposed to. 
 Well, I don't think 
 you're one of them. 
 ( sighs ) 
 Yeah, well, you don't know 
 what it was like... 
 with Maggie and Eric. 
 You're looking 
 for reasons again. 
 And what are you looking for? 
 Someone to have a baby with? 
 Is that 
 what you think? 
 Because if it is, then 
 what the hell are we doing here? 
 ( sighs ) 
 Happy New Year. 
 A whole cascade of things have 
 to happen to cause CML. 
 Philadelphia chromosome 
 doesn't mean instant cancer. 
 No. 
 Just that you're born 
 with a big strike against you. 
 As soon as you get this message, 
 you call me, okay? 
 I want to talk to you. 
 Immediately. Right away. 
 Maybe you're trying me 
 right now, 
 so I'm just going to hang up, 
 and... 
 and you got to call me. 
 You going to jump? 
 It's not 
 a trick question. 
 Yeah, sure, it's not. 
 Here, I need you 
 to sign off on this. 
 What the hell 
 you doing up here, man? 
 It's freezing. 
 Yeah, well, I got 
 a very high core temp. 
 It's a Latin thing. 
 You want to talk 
 or something? 
 No. Why would I? 
 I don't know. 
 You seem a little ragged. 
 Yeah, well, I just got 
 some chick trouble, 
 that's all. 
 Then I'm your man. 
 Except I don't like 
 to share. 
 You know, I heard 
 you never stick anyplace. 
 Maybe people don't 
 go to the mat for you 
 because they have 
 no idea who you are. 
 All right. 
 All right, 
 so there was... 
 there was this crazy nurse 
 at my last hospital. 
 In Newark? 
 Yeah. She's just 
 a piece of work, 
 and it just... 
 just ended bad. 
 ( scoffs ) 
 It usually does. 
 So, you know, I came here... 
 I came here just to focus, 
 and stay on the straight 
 and narrow, you know? 
 Sounds like 
 a good idea. 
 Yeah... one would think. 
 Except it's easier said 
 than done, 
 'cause this girl... 
 she's got my number, 
 if you know what I mean-- 
 and a very 
 pissed-off husband. 
 ( laughing ) 
 Yeah. 
 See? I'm starting 
 to like you more already. 
 Yeah. 
 Damn, so many patients. 
 God... 
 Don't you 
 feel better now? 
 Not really, no. 
 Can't say that I do. 
 Type and Rh are 
 back on Amanda. 
 Oh. 
 Then we're done. 
 You off already? 
 Yeah. 
 I have a doctor's 
 appointment. 
 Oh. 
 I'm going to see 
 Coburn. 
 Coburn? 
 At her practice. 
 Uh... 
 I'll, uh, I'll get 
 Clemente to cover. 
 It's okay. 
 You're working. 
 No, I should 
 come with you. 
 It probably would be 
 easier if you didn't. 
 Hey... 
 Hey? 
 When I say I want us 
 to keep it, 
 you don't like 
 the way it sounds. 
 But anything else 
 is a lie. 
 Luka? Neela's waiting 
 for you to sign off 
 on the Ramsey 
 girl. 
 KOVAC: 
 Get Clemente 
 to do it. 
 He's MIA. 
 I don't know 
 what else to say. 
 Don't say anything. 
 Take one of these 
 every day. 
 It'll help keep you 
 and your baby healthy. 
 Okay. 
 Where are your parents? 
 My mom's making 
 some calls, 
 and my dad had to go 
 to a meeting. 
 Okay, if it 
 makes you nauseous, 
 try taking it at night 
 before you go to bed, okay? 
 This is some more information 
 that might be useful. 
 And we got this for you 
 from the 
 ultrasound. 
 ( sighs ) 
 I wish this didn't happen. 
 I wish I could 
 make it go away. 
 Well, everything happens 
 for a reason. 
 There was this party... 
 at my friend Ginny's house. 
 And I drank some beer 
 and I did some other stuff 
 with a couple of guys, and... 
 And I must have passed out 
 in a bedroom because... 
 when I woke up... 
 my jeans were on the floor 
 and there was blood 
 all over the sheets. 
 ( sobbing ): 
 I tried to change 
 the covers... 
 RASGOTRA: 
 Amanda... 
 were you r*ped? 
 I always thought 
 the first time would be 
 with someone I loved. 
 Why didn't you say something? 
 I don't want this. 
 Please. 
 You need to explain 
 to your parents what happened. 
 They'll understand. 
 You have to tell them. 
 I did tell them. 
 Mrs. Ramsey. 
 I'll call you back. 
 Amanda told you 
 what happened to her? 
 Yes. 
 And you still 
 want her to do this? 
 That baby can't be punished 
 for how it was conceived. 
 It's not up to us to determine 
 who gets to be born. 
 We're talking about 
 a 15-year-old girl, 
 your daughter, who was r*ped. 
 Neela. 
 You'd force her 
 to carry this to term 
 and change the course 
 of her life? 
 I-I wouldn't force 
 her to do anything. 
 She believes the same 
 things that we believe. 
 This is an inappropriate 
 conversation. 
 Inappropriate? 
 She's terrified. 
 She doesn't want to keep it. 
 Okay, let's take a walk. 
 Think for one minute 
 about what's in 
 your daughter's best interests. 
 KOVAC: 
 Neela! 
 You think it's in her best 
 interest to k*ll the baby? 
 Because I can assure you 
 that in the eyes of God, 
 it most certainly is not. 
 Excuse me. 
 Okay, leave these 
 people alone now. 
 They've made a decision. 
 The parents have 
 no legal rights. 
 The pregnancy emancipates her. 
 There's nothing else you can do. 
 That girl's head 
 is so far twisted 
 she doesn't understand 
 she has a choice. 
 She doesn't want an abortion. 
 She doesn't want 
 to have the baby either. 
 Anyone can see that. 
 What about misoprostol? 
 It's used as an abortifacient 
 all over the world. 
 She won't consent to that. 
 Just let it go, Neela. 
 You're the wrong person 
 to talk to about this. 
 Excuse me? 
 I would like your permission 
 to consult another attending. 
 Someone who's not Catholic. 
 Listen to me very seriously. 
 I'm a doctor first, 
 above and beyond anything else. 
 And I don't let 
 my personal beliefs 
 get in the way 
 of a patient's best interests. 
 Ever! 
 Now give me that chart 
 and move on to the next one. 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's just that there's got to be 
 something that we can do. 
 You're done here. 
 KOVAC: 
 Do you want to have this baby? 
 I have to. 
 Is it what you want? 
 No. 
 No, it isn't. 
 This is called a laminaria. 
 It goes into the cervix 
 where it absorbs water 
 and swells, 
 ( baby crying ) 
 creating a larger opening. 
 ( children laughing ) 
 After that happens, 
 it's possible that the fetus 
 might fall out. 
 Possible? 
 You might have a miscarriage. 
 Does it hurt? 
 A little. 
 There might be some cramping. 
 Is it a sin? 
 It's just a medical way 
 we have of, uh... 
 giving God a chance 
 to reconsider. 
 WOMAN: 
 Abigail Lockhart? 
 Oh, my God! 
 Nobody was out today. 
 I had a pick of the litter! 
 Hey, come on. 
 You've got to leave. 
 Hey, what the hell 
 is wrong with you? 
 Hey! 
 Cops are on me. 
 They're on my ass. 
 And why? Because your ... 
 of a husband Bobby's 
 put out a missing persons 
 report, that's why. 
 He did? 
 Yeah. How long you think we got 
 till he traces you to me? 
 How long you think 
 before I'm walking around 
 with my testicles in a jar? 
 Vicky, Vic, Vic... 
 Ooh. I love you. 
 But sometimes you can be 
 such a little f*gg*t. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, I'm gonna get 
 a big boyfriend 
 who's gonna kick 
 your maniac of a husband's ass. 
 How do you like that, huh? 
 Huh?! How do you like that? 
 Hey... ow! 
 You're ripping the leather! 
 Just quiet, will you? 
 ( laughs ) 
 Yeah, that's great. 
 This is just great. 
 You got to pay your tickets. 
 Just great, damn it. 
 Hey, Vic, what's going on? 
 Hey, X-Ray, how's it going? 
 So this must be Jodie, huh? 
 Who, her? 
 That's not Jodie. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 You know what's weird? 
 I've parked here a lot of times, 
 I never had a problem. 
 Yeah, that's really weird, huh? 
 But we're gonna take the el. 
 All right. 
 Nice meeting you. 
 Likewise. 
 BRET: 
 Yo, Ray. 
 Bret. 
 Hey, how was practice? 
 Thanks for meeting me, man. 
 Can we grab some coffee? 
 Yeah. So I took care 
 of everything. 
 Schedule's all cleared up. 
 I thought we were gonna talk 
 before you did anything. 
 Did something happen? 
 Don't tell me Ginsberg 
 isn't interested. 
 No, it's still on. 
 Here's the thing, Ray-- 
 you've been pretty busy 
 with this whole 
 doctor thing lately 
 and kind of distracted, 
 you know? 
 Oh, true, true. 
 But I'm 100% 
 on board now, okay? 
 110, actually. 
 Well, we all got together 
 and talked about it. 
 Who did? 
 The guys. This morning. 
 Kind of decided the band's 
 got to make some changes. 
 Changes? 
 What do you mean changes? 
 You'll need to come back to 
 have the laminaria removed. 
 Probably feel a little pain, 
 but nothing to worry about. 
 You can take ibuprofen. 
 That should help.

 in the belly,

 You're a Christian. 
 What do I tell my mom? 
 She'll think 
 you're having a miscarriage. 
 And you will be. 
 All done. 
 You can take her home now. 
 Okay. Thank you, 
 doctor. 
 Weaver's MRI results are back. 
 What happened? 
 Sorry? 
 What were you doing in there? 
 Taking care 
 of the patient, Neela. 
 ( dialing ) 
 Hey, Abby, it's me. 
 Um... I guess I've missed you. 
 Um... nothing. 
 I'll... I'll see you soon. 
 Okay? 
 Advanced degeneration 
 with a cartilaginous flap. 
 At least that explains the pain. 
 I've seen 
 that kind of thing heal 
 with enough bed rest 
 and physical therapy. 
 I've been putting this off 
 for years. 
 Maybe it's time 
 to face the music. 
 I'll need 
 a total hip replacement. 
 Not necessarily. 
 Just when Henry's starting 
 to run around like a crazy man. 
 How is he? 
 He's great. 
 You should see him. 
 He looks just like Sandy. 
 I went by your place, 
 but I figured you might 
 come home this way. 
 I don't want 
 everything we have 
 to come down to 
 this one decision. 
 We can get past it. 
 You did what 
 you had to do. 
 Doesn't mean 
 we can't be together. 
 I didn't do it. 
 I couldn't. 
 I want to keep it.

 Are you loving

 Yeah. 
 PRATT: 
 Oh, this isn't awkward? 
 What? That you and I 
 are equals now? 
 Dr. Crenshaw is 
 our new chief resident. 
 Neela Rasgotra. 
 Two years in the ER, 
 then defected. 
 It took you that long 
 to figure out you were 
 wasting your time? 
 I'm your daddy. 
 What's up? 
 How's the new intern doing? 
 She's very, uh, devoted. 
 (quietly): 
 Thank you, Jesus. 
 Were you the best one there? 
 How many people did you save? 
 Did you rock? 
 Next time you don't do 
 what I tell you to do, 
 or any other attending 
 tells you to do, 
 you're gonna find yourself 
 getting bum-rushed 
 right out of this program. 
 You don't even 
 appreciate the fact 
 that I took 
 the time and money 
 to go out and buy you 
 some new clothes. 
 I didn't ask you 
 to do that. 
 No, because you'd rather 
 go to school dressed 
 like a bag lady. 
 Would you rather 
 I dressed like a slut?! 
 Because that's how most 
 of the other girls dress. 
 I'd rather you dressed 
 like someone that has 
 a mother that 
 cares about her. 
 Tony, would you please 
 say something? 
 Good morning. 
 What's wrong 
 with the way I dress? 
 She won't even try on the 
 clothes I bought for her. 
 Those are nice. 
 They're ugly, and I refuse 
 to conform to some anorexic, 
 media-fueled ideal 
 of beauty. 
 That's fine, 
 but you're not leaving 
 the house dressed like that. 
 Tony? 
 I hate 
 living here! 
 LOCKHART: 
 We never resolved 
 the nanny issue. 
 Do you really want someone else 
 raising our child? 
 Well, I'm just talking 
 about a few hours a week 
 so I can at least get 
 some stuff done around here. 
 Oh, I thought we had agreed 
 to stagger our shifts. 
 Well, and what, 
 never see each other? 
 I mean, even 
 if that was practical, 
 after your 
 first day alone, 
 you'd be begging 
 for help, trust me. 
 Mm. I think 
 I can handle it. 
 Well, if you can 
 handle it so well, 
 help me get Joe 
 in the car. 
 We're late for our first 
 Mommy and Baby class. 
 (baby cooing) 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 What? I thought it 
 would be fun for... What?

 No, you don't. 
 This is not my style,

 ask her to go shopping. 
 Then you guys buy

 What are you doing? 
 Damage control. 
 Sarah...

 This is not cool. 
 Do you mind? 
 I'm changing. 
 I hope your mother

 She won't.

 for girls my age these days. 
 Hmm. 
 There is a lot 
 of pressure at school. 
 Oh. 
 What you wear, 
 what you eat, 
 what you don't eat. 
 What's his name? 
 Who? 
 This is obviously about a guy. 
 No, it's not. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Maybe I should dress 
 like a hussy. 
 Maybe we should get 
 you a plaid jacket. 
 We'll just tell everyone 
 you're a lesbian. 
 (sighs) 
 Adam. 
 Huh? 
 Adam Horner, but he doesn't even 
 look at me. 
 Well, good. I don't want 
 some guy named Horndog 
 anywhere near you. 
 It's Horner. 
 Listen, most guys are jerks, 
 but if you want this guy... 
 Okay, wait a minute. 
 You're a guy. 
 Exactly, and if you want 
 this guy to notice you, 
 forget about your clothes 
 and ignore him. 
 That's your advice? 
 Yup. 
 Ignore him? 
 Yup, that's right. 
 Wow. You really suck 
 at this. 
 Trust me. Most guys want 
 what they can't have. 
 You ignore him, that guy'll come 
 running to you, all right? 
 Try not to k*ll anyone today. 
 Bye. 
 TAGGART: 
 He's out. 
 PRATT: 
 All right. 
 Hope, you're going 
 to take a deep breath, 
 and you're going 
 to hold it. 
 Now, if you don't get 
 the tube in by the time 
 you run out of air, we're gonna 
 stop, and we're gonna bag. 
 Okay? Are you ready? 
 With you and Jesus 
 guiding my hand, I am. 
 PRATT: 
 Right. 
 (inhales deeply) 
 Okay, sweep the tongue 
 to the side 
 and advance until 
 you're in the vallecula. 
 Elevate the scope 
 at a 45-degree angle. 
 See the cords? 
 All right, I'll give you 
 some cricoid pressure. 
 How's that? 
 Come on, Hope. 
 The cords should be 
 right there. He's a young guy. 
 All right, pull up more, but do 
 not rock back against the teeth. 
 Aim the end of the handle 
 to where the wall 
 meets the ceiling. 
 Can you see 
 the aryepiglottic folds? 
 Hello?! 
 Sats are 
 dropping. Pratt. 
 Whoa. All right, 
 pull out. 
 You bag, you breathe. 
 (loud panting) 
 I'm sorry... 
 I ran... 
 If you were doing 
 what I told you to do, 
 you should have been able 
 to pass the tube. Come on. 
 Maybe you should 
 sit down. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 I don't feel so good. 
 Uh, I'm in. 
 (thudding) 
 Yeah, this should keep it 
 from swelling. 
 Oh, bless you, Sam. 
 What happened 
 to her? 
 Nothing. 
 (pager buzzes) 
 Damn, it's only 
 the morning test. 
 What are you doing 
 with the transport beeper? 
 I gave that to Jane. 
 You know, I don't think she 
 really wanted it, so I offered. 
 You can't monopolize 
 the beeper, Ray. 
 The other residents need 
 the experience, too. 
 She gets airsick. 
 Hey, what's going on 
 with your rhabdomyolysis guy? 
 He's pretty stable. 
 He's making urine. 
 What about his creatinine? 
 I'd have to 
 check the chart. 
 Peak CPK? 
 Medicine team's 
 all over it. 
 Come on, man. 
 You got to be all over it. 
 You cannot let 
 the internal med docs 
 take over 
 your patient's care. 
 I can't? 
 Hey, I'm serious, man. 
 You've got 
 critical patients. 
 You got to stay 
 on top of the labs. 
 I know, but the guy was ready 
 to hand off, and I... 
 And what? 
 And that was 
 a great talk. 
 What the hell's going on 
 with the PACS system? 
 Down again. 
 They said they should 
 have it running in an hour, 
 but they've been saying 
 that since yesterday. 
 So, is it true? 
 Rumor is 
 you k*lled an intern. 
 Yeah, I wish. 
 You know, everything 
 in this place is crap. 
 The equipment sucks, 
 the students are incompetent, 
 the interns 
 can't finish a chart, 
 the residents-- they don't give 
 a damn about their patient... 
 Yeah, okay, okay, Kovac. 
 I see what 
 you're going to say. 
 That I was the same way, 
 right? But I wasn't. 
 I didn't say anything. 
 Yeah, I could chart, 
 I could clear beds, 
 and I never passed out 
 tubing a patient. 
 I know, you were 
 really, really special. 
 You need to go through 
 in-service exam results 
 with your residents. 
 Have you seen these? 
 See, this is exactly 
 what I'm talking about. 
 They don't know jack 
 about emergency medicine. 
 Solomon is an idiot, 
 Hope is annoying 
 and incompetent, 
 Gates should have stayed 
 a paramedic, and Jane is like... 
 What's wrong with 
 Jane? She is good. 
 No, Jane is creepy, 
 I'm serious. 
 She's always 
 sneaking up on me. 
 She's like those twins 
 in The Shining. 
 Look, in-service shows you 
 their strengths and weaknesses, 
 so focus on that. 
 They all have their 
 own learning process, 
 so you need to 
 adjust accordingly. 
 If the residents fail, it may be 
 because you're a bad teacher. 
 (sighs) 
 (sighs) 
 WOMAN: 
 Down on two, 
 up on three, 
 and mommies let go! 
 Good. 
 Everyone pick up their babies. 
 Hi. 
 I'm sorry I'm late. 
 I'm Abby, and, 
 uh, this is Joe. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. 
 Um, am-am I in the right place? 
 This is the, uh, 
 Mommy and Baby class? 
 Yes. Yes, it is. 
 Good. Well, uh... I'm a mommy... 
 (laughs) 
 ...and, uh... and 
 this is a baby. 
 Uh, yeah, being suspended 
 by his crotch. 
 Excuse me? 
 You're carrying your child 
 in a device that can cause 
 hip luxation and spinal injury. 
 He really should be in a sling. 
 Oh, well, you know, 
 I'm a doctor, um, and... 
 Then you'd think 
 she'd know better. 
 She is sitting 
 right here. 
 WOMAN: 
 Well, um, then 
 you should know 
 that, um, a happy, healthy baby 
 is always carried in a sling. 
 Well, I do know 
 that if you dress your baby 
 like some sort of 
 designer accessory, 
 you're headed 
 for problems. 
 But don't worry. 
 I work in the ER, 
 so I'll be there 
 to take care of her 
 when she comes in 14, pregnant, 
 with a drug overdose. 
 Maybe this isn't 
 the best class for you. 
 WOMAN: 
 Thank you so much 
 for the lunch tray, Archie. 
 I particularly enjoyed 
 the bread pudding. 
 Oh, you're welcome, Emma. 
 That's one 
 of my favorites, too. 
 Ah, the return of Goat Boy. 
 I heard one of the doctors 
 made a charm bracelet 
 from all they took 
 from his belly. 
 Okay, here's what we got: 
 stable CHF, going to tele. 
 76-year-old lady with 
 pyelo, had levaquin. 
 Incomplete miscarriage. 
 Do a repeat pelvic 
 in an hour 
 to see if everything passed 
 and the os is closed. 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
 What the hell are these? 
 Pass-ons. Oh, and her BP's a 
 little low, like 90 systolic. 
 She's type-and-crossed 
 for transfusion? 
 No, but that's a... 
 that's a good idea. 
 Do that, totally. 
 Two-year-old with 
 possible meningitis. 
 Ceftriaxone on board. 
 Currently at CT, 
 needs an LP when he gets back. 
 Morris, we do not 
 sign out spinal taps. 
 Since when? 
 Wait a minute, 
 wait a minute. 
 Hold on. These aren't pass-ons. 
 They're train wrecks. 
 I'm not taking them. 
 Dude, I can't. 
 Max has a soccer game. 
 It's the playoffs. 
 I promised him I'd be there. 
 Who? 
 My son. 
 It's a family thing. 
 Yeah, his family even 
 know about you yet? 
 No, no, no, no. We're keeping 
 that on the low-low for now. 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 (chuckles) 
 Exactly. 
 Thanks, dog. 
 Did you just 
 see that? 
 Yup. He's your dogboy. 
 Please. He's 
 not my dog, 
 and he's not my boy. 
 And we don't use 
 the two together. 
 I know. 
 So, you're gonna 
 take one of these? 
 Nope. I have a trauma coming in, 
 and you're not always going 
 to have the luxury 
 of having another attending 
 on shift with you. 
 You need to learn how to handle 
 these things on your own. 
 Mr. Jennings is 
 on his way up to ortho 
 and Lundquist 
 is out of here. 
 Nice job, Ray. 
 Here's four more. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 Is this about 
 the transport beeper? 
 The packing is webril, 
 and we wrap with bias. 
 We try to keep it tight 
 enough to immobilize, 
 but not to the point 
 of discomfort. 
 You don't want to 
 cut off circulation. 
 Solomon, 
 you know, you didn't 
 do so hot 
 on the Ortho section 
 of the in-service. 
 So what's the difference 
 between a Jones 
 and a Dancer fracture? 
 Dancer's a proximal 
 avulsion. 
 Does great with 
 conservative therapy. 
 Jones is transverse, 
 a little more distal 
 and you got to keep 
 an eye on this bad boy 
 because there's a good 
 chance of non-union. 
 Let me guess: you just had 
 a patient like that? 
 No. 
 Right. Come on. 
 Who's got somebody 
 in Curtain 2? 
 Uh, me, sir. 
 48-year-old PSVT resolved 
 with adenosine. 
 Excuse me, doctor. 
 Is your boss still here? 
 Excuse me. 
 I need to speak with Archie. 
 Dr. Morris is not my boss 
 and I'm afraid 
 he's gone for the day. 
 Is there something 
 I can help you with? 
 No. 
 Jane, you need to focus 
 on Cardiology. 
 What are the options 
 with a hemodynamically stable 
 wide complex tachyarrhythmia? 
 Lidocaine if you think V tach. 
 What else? 
 (coughing) 
 Amiodarone. 
 Okay, I'm guessing amiodarone. 
 Well, procainamide and amio 
 can do the trick, 
 but you want to stay away 
 from beta and calcium blockers 
 'cause you'll end up 
 with V fib 
 if you have a bypass tract. 
 Right? 
 So how'd you manage to fail 
 every subsection 
 of the in-service exam? 
 I guess I just don't test well. 
 Well, you better start. 
 Come on. 
 Have you got 
 something to present? 
 No. Actually I started 
 with Dr. Kovac... 
 Where are your charts? 
 Let me see them. 
 Well, I'm still 
 working on them. 
 I told you to keep 
 them current. 
 You got to do them 
 as you go. 
 What part of this concept 
 don't you understand? 
 KOVAC: 
 Five-year-old with 
 crush injury to abdomen. 
 He and grandpa were 
 chopping down a tree. 
 They're bringing grandfather 
 with chainsaw injuries. 
 All right, I got it. 
 All right, keep working 
 up your patients 
 and grab a couple more charts. 
 KOVAC: 
 He needs O-neg, a second line, 
 and page surgery. 
 Where do you think 
 you're going? 
 Chainsaw injuries 
 can be gnarly. 
 No, no, no, you need to finish 
 with the patients you've got 
 before you do 
 anything else. 
 Dr. Rasgotra? 
 Yes. 
 Hi, I'm Katey Evans-- 
 medical student. 
 Dr. Crenshaw told me 
 to shadow you today. 
 He did? 
 I got the feeling I was 
 getting on his nerves. 
 He gives that impression 
 to everyone. 
 Hey, Katey. 
 Friend of yours? 
 Hardly. 
 We went out a 
 couple times. 
 It didn't work out. 
 Too bad. He's cute. 
 Cute, but he's way 
 too into himself 
 and to be honest, 
 he's orally challenged. 
 Oh, bad breath? 
 Not exactly-- he won't 
 go south of 14th Street. 
 You know... He refuses 
 to dine at the Y? 
 Oh, I'm sorry. 
 This is what 
 I'm talking about. 
 Making friends 
 and saving lives. 
 Does it get any better 
 than this, ladies? 
 No, it does not. 
 So, Mrs. Draper is back 
 for her 27th hospital admission. 
 Status: postpancreatic 
 pseudocyst. 
 27th? 
 Yes. Someone needs 
 to tell her 
 the hospital stopped giving out 
 frequent flier miles. 
 Oh, and she's a chronic 
 rectal discomfort. 
 And you two get 
 to work her up 
 and review her old charts. 
 All 27? 
 No. Why don't you forget 
 all about visits 
 six, 13 and, um... 
 what do you think, 21? 
 Yeah, that should 
 keep it interesting. 
 It'll be like playing 
 patient roulette. 
 Be prepared to present her 
 at afternoon rounds. 
 Smiles all around. 
 Maybe he should use 
 his extensive surgical skills 
 to remove that bug 
 from his ass. 
 Oh, saved by the bell. 
 We're paged to the ER. 
 I'm so glad I'm not 
 doing an ER rotation. 
 I have heard horror stories. 
 Oh, it's not so bad-- 
 once you get used 
 to the smell. 
 The line is good to go. 
 Pressure's only 85 
 after the bolus. 
 How much O-neg? 
 40 per kilo. 
 800cc's. 
 Chest and pelvis films are back. 
 KOVAC: 
 Let me see. 
 Sam, your son's school called. 
 Said he never showed up 
 for homeroom. 
 First hemoglobin is 9.8. 
 What? 
 I dropped him off this morning. 
 Type and cross four units. 
 He's losing a ton of blood. 
 Crush injury? 
 Yeah. Unstable pelvis. 
 Open book fracture with complete 
 SI joint disruption 
 and lateral displacement. 
 SAM 
 I've got the T-POD. 
 How's the belly? 
 Spleen is okay. 
 Looks like a small liver lac. 
 So he goes to angio first? 
 For embolization. 
 Hypotension 
 and pelvic fracture has... 
 A 50% mortality. 
 Blood at the meatus. 
 Probably tore his urethra, 
 but that'll have to wait. 
 Along with his liver. 
 If they can stop the pelvic 
 bleeders in angio, 
 he might make it to the OR. 
 Okay, bring blood, FFP, and 
 get him on a portable monitor. 
 It wasn't a very big tree. 
 It was only about eight inches 
 in diameter. 
 I was just finishing the cut 
 when the chainsaw broke... Ow! 
 Sorry about that, 
 Mr. King. 
 We're going to get you 
 really numbed up right now. 
 Another five of lido to me. 
 How we doing in here? 
 He's pretty lucky. 
 Most of these wounds 
 look superficial. 
 I'm just going 
 to clean and close. 
 How's my grandson? 
 Uh, his injuries are serious: 
 he's bleeding internally, 
 but he's hanging in there. 
 Can I see him? 
 KOVAC: 
 Not right now. 
 We're taking him upstairs 
 and we're going to try 
 to stop the bleeding, okay? 
 You good down here 
 if I go up to angio with him? 
 Yeah. 
 I'm good. Go. 
 Okay. 
 I was being so careful. 
 I thought he was safe. 
 Don't worry, sir. We're doing 
 everything we can to help him. 
 Are you almost 
 finished in here? 
 No. Why? 
 I could really use your help 
 in Curtain 2. 
 You've got to be a little bit 
 more specific, Ray. 
 Okay, 
 Morris' little old UTI lady, 
 the one that's just ""waiting for 
 a ride,"" has a systolic of 55. 
 (sighs) 
 Damn it, Morris. 
 All right, here, 
 keep irrigating 
 and set up 
 another suture kit. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Got it. 
 76-year-old, 
 fever and gram-negative rods 
 on the UA. 
 Morris said she was tucked, 
 nothing to do. 
 I guess he lied. 
 Yeah. 
 Tachy after two liters, he 
 should have seen this coming. 
 Access? 
 PIV, we're working 
 on another... 
 HALEH: 
 Pratt! 
 Here. 
 BARDELLI: 
 Rennie Stevens, 
 welding t*nk expl*si*n. 
 Second- and third-degree burns 
 over chest, face, and arms. 
 Vitals? 
 Tachy, BP: 138/90, 
 sat 82. 
 Other one's 
 more stable. 
 Other one? 
 Luis Escobar, 23, 
 shrapnel to neck 
 and left chest. 
 Vitals stable, 
 good breath sounds. 
 All right. 
 I better page an attending. 
 I am an attending. 
 I got this. 
 Put him in Trauma Two. 
 Jane! 
 You're with Haleh. 
 Solomon, you're with me. 
 Come on, 
 Trauma One. 
 Let's go. 
 Ray, titrate dopamine 
 and mix up levophed 
 if she doesn't respond 
 to 10 mikes. 
 All right. 
 All right? 
 Alex, where are you? 
 No, you're not. 
 Don't lie to me. 
 The school called 
 the hospital. 
 Yeah, well, you got ten minutes 
 to get your butt back to... 
 Solomon, 
 help Sam make some room. 
 Please give me something 
 for the pain! 
 All right, 
 another five of morphine. 
 Hang tough, Mr. Stevens. 
 We're going to help you. 
 Start a second line with 
 two liters of LR, wide open. 
 Full thickness 
 over the entire chest. 
 I'll alert the burn unit. 
 Sats down to 83. 
 Okay, listen to me 
 very closely, Mr. Stevens. 
 We need to put a tube in 
 to help you breathe, okay? 
 Eight-oh and an 
 intubation tray. 
 I'll be right back. 
 Talk to me, ladies. 
 Blunt and penetrating trauma. 
 Thrown against a wall 
 by the blast. 
 Looks like shrapnel 
 to the upper torso and neck. 
 Hey, what's 
 your name, man? 
 Luis. Luis Escobar. 
 How's Rennie? 
 Uh, we're working on him, 
 but now it's your turn. 
 Tell me where it hurts. 
 My chest. 
 BP: 95/65. 
 Yup, he's decreased 
 on the left. 
 Sats 92%. 
 Any pain here? 
 (Escobar yells) 
 All right, CBC, chemistry, 
 coags, type-and-cross for two, 
 liter of ringers, C-spine, 
 chest, and pelvis. Page surgery. 
 I'll be right back. 
 You're doing good, Mr. Escobar. 
 (crowd applauds) 
 MORRIS: 
 That's it, Max. 
 That's it. Hustle! 
 MAN: 
 Go, Stuart, stay with him. 
 Come on, Max, come on. 
 You take this guy. 
 If you can't go around him, 
 you go through him! 
 Hey, come on, man. 
 What? 
 You're not setting 
 a good example. 
 Whoo! 
 That's it. 
 Nice, nice, buddy. 
 You're k*lling them 
 out there. 
 Who is that 
 with your son? 
 I don't know. 
 Excuse me, Coach? 
 Who's Max talking to? 
 COACH: 
 I'm not sure. 
 He said he was a friend. 
 Chest x-ray on Escobar. 
 All right, 
 pneumothorax on the left. 
 Set up for a chest tube. 
 I'll be right over. 
 We're having a hard time 
 finding a second line. 
 Dr. Pratt, 
 he's bradying down! 
 Hold on. 
 Try a saphenous. 
 If that doesn't work, 
 we'll go central. 
 Right. 
 Heart rate's in the 40s! 
 I need to put a tube 
 in your chest 
 to re-expand your 
 lung, Mr. Escobar. 
 Need any help in here? 
 Push 50 mikes of fentanyl. 
 What's going on 
 with Morris' patient? 
 Uh, I think 
 she's doing okay. 
 I handed her off 
 to Gates. 
 Gates? 
 You left her with Gates? 
 Yeah, he's all over it. 
 All right, you're going to 
 feel some pressure here, okay? 
 (grunts) 
 Gates is an intern, Ray. 
 Who's supervising him? 
 I guess, 
 officially, you are. 
 Jane, find out 
 what's going on with Gates. 
 I'm not having any luck 
 with the ABG. 
 Angle the needle 
 at 45 degrees. 
 I can't see. 
 My glasses keep fogging. 
 Well, maybe next time, 
 you should leave 
 the hazmat uniform at home. 
 Feel for the pulse. 
 You see that? 
 Yo, Doc. 
 Your sheet metal guy in Exam 3 
 lost his foot pulse. 
 Nurses can't get 
 his leg out. 
 All right, tell them to give him 
 five more of morphine 
 and, uh, grab me a Doppler. 
 I'll be there in a few minutes. 
 Someone grab me 
 a central line kit. 
 This young lady needs 
 a CVP monitor. 
 You're putting it 
 in a central line? 
 Yes. 
 Early Goal-Directed Therapy 
 for Sepsis-- 
 all the kids are doing it. 
 Are we going to get in trouble? 
 No, this lady is in trouble. 
 We're trying to save her, 
 that's what we do. 
 God, 
 give us the strength 
 and the knowledge 
 to help save 
 this sweet woman. 
 Hallelujah to that, sister. 
 Good embolization 
 of the superior gluteals 
 and pudendal arteries. 
 That ought to buy you 
 a little time. 
 Pressure's back down to 60. 
 Another 400 of PRBCs. 
 Crenshaw's standing by 
 in the OR. 
 Looks like the liver 
 lac opened up. 
 His heart rate's 
 dropping. 
 Damn it. 
 Okay, let's transfer him. 
 One, two, three. 
 Mig of atropine and 
 squeeze in the blood. 
 Want me to continue bagging? 
 No, see what they need 
 in the ER. 
 I've got this. 
 Hi, it's me. 
 Mommy and Baby 
 was a freak show. 
 Um, so we're headed 
 to the park and I thought maybe 
 even if you only had 
 a couple minutes, 
 you might want to come by 
 and say hi. 
 I'm going to look 
 for some normal moms, 
 so we'll be here 
 for a while. 
 Bye. 
 Hi. 
 Hey. 
 Can I sit here? 
 Sure. 
 Yo no quiero 
 perder mi trabajo 
 pero si mi jefa se entera, 
 es la primer vez en mi trabajo 
 y yo estoy muy nerviosa, 
 yo no se que hacer. 
 Quisas estas tarde. 
 Is everything okay? 
 She thinks she's pregnant. 
 Oh, congratulations. 
 Oh, no. 
 No? 
 No, the father is the husband 
 of the woman she works for. 
 Oh. 
 Wow, that's... 
 What's she going to do? 
 I told her to 
 have an abortion. 
 That's what I did. 
 You got pregnant 
 with the husband 
 of the woman you work for, too? 
 It happens. 
 Los uniqos hombres 
 que no fantasayan 
 con estar con sus nanasson 
 los que ya estan haciendo. 
 Mm. 
 What'd she say? 
 Oh, ""The only husbands 
 that don't fantasize 
 about banging 
 their nanny... 
 are the ones 
 who are already doing it."" 
 It's sort of our nanny motto. 
 Oh, you're all nannies? 
 Yeah, aren't you? 
 Yes. 
 Yes, I am. 
 All right, tube's in position, 
 no pneumo. 
 Vent pressures 
 are almost 50. 
 Damn it. Chest wall's 
 restricting lung expansion. 
 He needs an escharotomy. 
 Ten blade. 
 Sats down to 84. 
 All right, 
 put the vent rate up to 25 
 and the tidal volume 
 down to 500. 
 Solomon, I need room, man. 
 Okay, Mr. King. 
 We're gonna find you 
 a new parking spot. 
 Mr. King? 
 Mr. King, 
 can you hear me?! 
 TAGGART: 
 Son of a bitch. 
 Pratt! 
 The little head lac's 
 not so little. 
 All right, 
 keep pressure on it. 
 He must've hit 
 something arterial. 
 Recheck a crit and 
 type and cross for two. 
 Okay, okay, sats are coming up. 
 Thank you. 
 That's one down. 
 We need an 
 attending in here. 
 Pratt, take 
 a look at this. 
 All right, what's that, 
 fluid in the spleen? 
 Looks like a hematoma. 
 Where's surgery? 
 Paged them three times. 
 Anything else 
 in the abdomen? 
 Nothing in Morrison's. 
 Vitals stable? 
 Tachy, but pressure's okay. 
 Second hematocrit 38. 
 Entrance and exit lateral 
 to the midline. 
 Doesn't penetrate platysma. 
 Burn unit on two. 
 IV blew. We can't get 
 a second line in here. 
 And grandpa's crit 
 is down to 29. 
 All right, 
 I'll be right there. 
 What's going on with Gates? 
 He's asking for 
 a rib spreader. 
 What the hell would he be 
 doing with a rib spreader? 
 I'm not really sure. 
 TAGGART: 
 Pratt, what do you 
 want me to do? 
 Just a sec. 
 What's going on out there? 
 Sorry, sorry, we were 
 stuck upstairs. 
 What do you need? 
 Burn unit is holding. 
 All right, page Kovac. 
 Don't bother. 
 We left him 
 with a pelvic trauma. 
 The boy crumped 
 in angio. 
 All right, uh... 
 Neela, get this guy up to CT. 
 Ray will fill you in on the way. 
 Haleh, transfer that 
 burn unit call next door. 
 Jam it into overdrive. 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 Come on, ref. 
 That's a foul. 
 Come on, this is soccer, 
 not water ballet. 
 Way to go, buddy, dig deep. 
 Work that ball. 
 Hey. Sorry I'm late. 
 I got hung up at work. 
 How are they doing? 
 Winning two to one. 
 Go, Stuart. 
 Go, Stuart! 
 Come on, Max! 
 Dude, you stay 
 with him, buddy. 
 Come on, Maxie. 
 Kick in the 
 afterburners, baby. 
 Do you know that guy? 
 No, who is he? 
 Apparently, 
 he's a friend of Max's. 
 Never seen him before. 
 Oh, okay, don't get fancy. 
 Don't get fancy, just... 
 just put it in the net! 
 Put it in the net! 
 Goal! 
 (cheering) 
 Yes! 
 Baby! 
 That was a rocket, huh?! 
 That's got to hurt, right? 
 Yes! 
 All right! 
 Did you see that?! 
 Yeah, that was beautiful. 
 You were giving them a taste 
 of Maximum destruction. 
 (growls) 
 Hey! What the hell do you think 
 you're doing? 
 Did you touch my kid?! 
 What? 
 You touched my kid. 
 Whoa, whoa, wait. 
 He's not your kid? 
 No, I don't know 
 who this creep is. 
 Is this how you 
 get your jollies, 
 touching little boys 
 at a park?! 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, 
 you're making 
 a big mistake here. 
 I think you're 
 making the mistake 
 you freakin' pervert. 
 Back off, man. 
 What, am I too 
 big for you? 
 Sir, are you okay? 
 Wake up. 
 Wake up, sir. 
 Call 911. 
 Get an ambulance. 
 And the cops. 
 There's no need to panic. 
 It's all good. 
 I'm an ER doc. 
 I'm an ER doctor. 
 Everybody just back up. 
 Let me do what I have to do 
 and give me... 
 Oh! 
 They spent about 
 a million dollars 
 on fertility dr*gs 
 to have this kid. 
 Look at her, that's not 
 a million-dollar baby. 
 Right, like, 
 take the hint, lady. 
 Maybe there's a good reason 
 why Mother Nature 
 doesn't want you 
 having kids of your own. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 The woman she works 
 for is a bitch. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 She felt sorry 
 for her husband. 
 He seemed so lonely. 
 (speaking Spanish) 
 She was always going away 
 with her friends. 
 And all she did 
 was shop. 
 My boss has closets 
 full of clothes 
 she never wears. 
 Which is good for me. 
 So you wear her clothes? 
 What, you don't? 
 No. 
 You fool around 
 with her husband? 
 No. 
 He's ugly? 
 No. 
 Oh, no, he's... 
 he's hot. 
 He's a doctor. 
 I worked for 
 some doctors. 
 They wanted to kids safe 
 so they let me drive the Lexus. 
 And they went away a lot, 
 so I could always 
 use their apartment. 
 Which they didn't know about. 
 Course not. 
 Course not. 
 How you feeling, Mr. King? 
 I was a little woozy there 
 for a bit, 
 but I feel better after my nap. 
 Bacitracin and 
 a gauze dressing. 
 These need to come out 
 in seven days. 
 You know, I could probably 
 take those out myself. 
 No. 
 You need to come in 
 for a wound check. 
 Hey, make sure 
 that guy's X-ray 
 goes up with him 
 to the burn unit. 
 He's had three 
 liters of fluid 
 and needs seven more in 
 the first eight hours. 
 Is there any chance 
 I can be with my grandson? 
 I don't think so, 
 but we can get an update 
 on his condition. 
 CT's back on Escobar. 
 Grade three splenic lac. 
 Okay, good. 
 Consent for surgery 
 and he's all yours. 
 Sorry, but my chief 
 wants to observe him 
 down here for a while. 
 You just told me 
 he tore his spleen. 
 With no free blood, 
 and stable crits. 
 His belly's tender, 
 he's tachycardic, 
 and he'll have other fluid 
 losses through his burn. 
 The OR's full. 
 We can't take him 
 right now anyway. 
 Well, we can't keep 
 him down here. 
 We're getting slammed and 
 he's tying up a trauma room. 
 I don't know. 
 Put him in the ICU. 
 Crenshaw says we can't 
 use our last bed in ICU. 
 Hey, that's not 
 Crenshaw's call. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 I want you 
 to get rid of him. 
 If his crits are stable 
 for six hours, 
 he can go to telemetry. 
 Neela... 
 Louise Escobar's 
 girlfriend is here. 
 All right, I got 
 to go find Gates 
 before he kills somebody. 
 When I get back, that 
 guy better not be here. 
 Systolic pressure in the 70s 
 after aggressive fluid 
 resuscitation but responded well 
 to a dopamine infusion at 
 10 mikes per kilo per minute. 
 What have you been doing? 
 Excuse me. 
 Central venous 
 oxygen saturation 
 is in target range of 88%. 
 At this time, patient 
 remains guarded but stable 
 for critical 
 care service. 
 What is that? 
 I'm dictating my notes. 
 And you're kidding me, right? 
 There's no time 
 for you to send stuff 
 to a transcription service. 
 I need your notes 
 on the chart now. 
 Well, I find it so inefficient 
 to write everything down. 
 Yeah, well, that's 
 how we all do it, 
 so you better figure it out. 
 And what were you doing 
 with a rib spreader? 
 Well, one of your minor victims 
 from the expl*si*n came in 
 with metal wrapped 
 around his leg. 
 It was occluding blood 
 flow to the foot, 
 so I used the rib spreader 
 to pull the metal off. 
 Seemed safer than a 
 blowtorch, right? 
 Yeah, right, right, right. 
 Okay, hold on, hold on, 
 one second, one second, man. 
 I get it, okay. 
 You're the cool guy, the 
 paramedic who became a doctor. 
 And I'm pretty sure that 
 all the residents are eating up 
 your w*r stories 
 and tales from the street-- 
 I don't tell w*r stories. 
 But this is the ER. 
 And we have a way 
 of doing things, 
 a curriculum for shaping 
 young doctors, even you. 
 Oh, is that what this is about? 
 You feel the need to ""shape"" me? 
 Why don't you just teach me. 
 I like the shape I'm in. 
 I can't teach somebody 
 who thinks they know everything. 
 What are you talking about? 
 Talking about you running 
 around here unsupervised. 
 Putting in central lines. 
 What was I 
 supposed to do? 
 You were busy in 
 a double trauma. 
 I saved some woman's life 
 and some guy's foot. 
 And what would have happened 
 if you had messed up 
 on either one? 
 I don't know. 
 Who would have been responsible 
 for that? Not you. 
 Me. It would have been 
 my ass on the line. 
 So do we have to go through this 
 every damn shift? 
 I don't know. You going to ride 
 my ass every damn shift? 
 Because you seem to be 
 missing the point here. 
 I didn't mess up. 
 That's not the point, 
 and that's your problem. 
 Who's got 
 the urosepsis case? 
 Dr. Gates. At 
 your service. 
 Maya Tennyson, 
 Critical Care. 
 Yeah, excuse me, 
 Dr. Tennyson, 
 but we're in the middle 
 of some... 
 She's still on dopa at 10? 
 She's holding 
 her pressure 
 like a champ. 
 Hmm, nice work 
 with the early 
 goal-directed therapy. 
 By the way, 
 I love the dictation. 
 I can never read 
 anyone's writing down here. 
 The Bluetooth. 
 You just speak in this 
 little machine right here 
 and it prints up 
 instantly at the desk. 
 I like it. 
 This ER needed an attending 
 with some initiative. 
 Hey, I'm the attending. 
 He's an intern. 
 Well, actually, the Bluetooth 
 was Dr. Pratt's idea. 
 Huh. 
 I want to see the rest 
 of your charts now. 
 I bet you do. 
 Hey, Timmy, do they still 
 put people's names on hats 
 and stuff like that 
 in the gift shop? 
 You know what? 
 I think so. 
 But if you want to write 
 your name in your underwear 
 or something, man, 
 a Sharpie works 
 just as well. 
 No, no, no. 
 I just need to get 
 a gift for somebody. 
 What the hell happened to you? 
 I was att*cked by ninjas. 
 What's it look like? 
 Who's this? 
 Obnoxious soccer dad, 
 blunt head trauma with LOC, 
 breathing on his own, 
 normal vitals. What's open? 
 Talk to me, Morris. 
 Nothing to talk about. 
 Guy came at me. 
 I defended myself. 
 I'm patching him up. 
 Why'd he come at you? 
 Have you ever been 
 to a kids' soccer game? 
 Those parents are crazy. 
 I would never do anything 
 to hurt my grandson, Irene. 
 It was an accident. 
 What were you thinking? 
 He's only 
 five years old. 
 He shouldn't 
 be anywhere 
 near a chainsaw. 
 He wasn't. 
 Then why is 
 he in surgery? 
 Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt. 
 Uh, Dennis King, 
 this is my wife, Irene. 
 I can't believe this. 
 We only leave 
 our son with family, 
 just to be safe, and this 
 is how we're rewarded? 
 We're doing 
 everything we can 
 for Thomas. 
 Why don't I have a 
 nurse take you up 
 so you can 
 be with him 
 when he gets 
 out of surgery? 
 Okay. 
 Dennis, Dennis, 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know I am. 
 I know, 
 Dad, I know. 
 I raised my two boys by myself. 
 Wasn't easy being 
 a single dad back then. I... 
 I don't think I was 
 very good at it. 
 I thought I could 
 make up for it 
 by being a terrific 
 grandfather, but... 
 Looks like I blew that too. 
 Pratt. 
 You got a sec? 
 Yeah. I'll be right back, 
 Mr. King. 
 Thanks. 
 What's going on? 
 The police are here 
 for Morris 
 in connection 
 with an as*ault. 
 And there are two moms 
 with the cops 
 saying that Morris 
 is a child molester. 
 What? 
 SAM: 
 I got a feeling the white mom's 
 got a boxer's fracture. 
 What is Morris' problem? 
 Brain damage is the first 
 thing that comes to mind. 
 Dr. Pratt. 
 Escobar's losing his airway. 
 RASGOTRA: 
 Why didn't you intubate 
 prophylactically? 
 PRATT: 
 His face was spared. 
 He didn't seem like 
 he had respiratory issues. 
 PRATT: 
 Damn, he's already got 
 too much swelling. 
 Page Crenshaw again. 
 And get someone 
 from ENT down here. 
 Sats down to 76. 
 All right, somebody 
 get me a smaller tube. 
 A 7-5, 7-0. 
 It's too late for that. 
 You might need 
 an open trach. 
 Heart rate is dropping. 
 Please help him. 
 He was just talking 
 to me. 
 Damn, that 7-0 won't pass. 
 He needs a trach. 
 ENT is in OR 2 on a 
 radical neck dissection. 
 They can't come 
 down right now. 
 ENT needs to be here. 
 Well, they're not, 
 and this guy needs 
 an airway. 
 And you're sure 
 you can do this? 
 I think so. 
 You better know so. 
 How many have you done? 
 I've assisted on several. 
 Oh, man. 
 All right, OR Girl, please 
 do not make me regret this. 
 Okay, Katey, Betadine 
 and sterile sixes. 
 Without electrocautery juice, 
 this will be messy. 
 All right, Haleh. 
 Can you take Tina 
 to the Family Room? 
 Sure. 
 No, no, 
 I want to stay with him. 
 Come on, honey. 
 No, I want to stay... 
 We'll come and get you 
 as soon as we make him 
 more comfortable. 
 Okay,15 blade to me. 
 Neela. 
 Oh, I was hoping there would 
 be a reasonable explanation 
 for your incessant paging, 
 but you know what? 
 This is not it. 
 I had to do 
 a tracheotomy tube. 
 Oh, really, and who 
 told you to do that? 
 Because I sure didn't. 
 Nobody did. 
 My chief didn't 
 answer his pages. 
 You did this 
 without any supervision? 
 Dr. Pratt was here. 
 Oh, great, that 
 is such a relief. 
 Unfortunately, your little 
 ER forest friends 
 don't count anymore. 
 You want to be a surgeon? 
 Huh, want to be 
 a big girl doctor? 
 This isn't Barbie's 
 Dream Doll Hospital 
 you're playing in. 
 I am the ER attending. 
 Dr. Rasgotra was only 
 following my orders. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. Hello. 
 Dr. Pratt, 
 is it? 
 I took your silence 
 for subservience. 
 You know, not a lot 
 of ER attendings 
 have the skills to do a trach. 
 Very impressive, 
 Dr. Pratt. 
 Well, you just, uh, 
 take care of my girl here 
 and we'll call it even. 
 You don't need 
 to worry about that. 
 Dr. Rasgotra gets 
 plenty of my attention. 
 Oh, I think 
 I can manage this from here. 
 Why don't you girls, uh, 
 finish up down here. 
 You've done more than 
 enough. Believe me. 
 Wow, you're so lucky. 
 He seems like a great guy. 
 Yeah, right. 
 I'm going to go 
 and find the girlfriend, 
 tell her 
 what's happening. 
 Hey. 
 You did good, man. 
 Thanks. 
 (chuckles) 
 Must be quiet if you 
 have time to stand around. 
 How's the kid? 
 Looks like he's going 
 to pull through. 
 How's the grandfather? 
 Eh, he's a little worried, 
 but he'll be okay. 
 You make out okay 
 down here? 
 I heard you had two 
 more traumas come in. 
 Nothing I 
 couldn't deal with. 
 Well, if it's that quiet, 
 maybe I'll leave a 
 little early tonight. 
 Abby could probably use 
 some help with the baby. 
 Go ahead. Go for it. 
 Sure? 
 Yeah. I got it all 
 dialed in down here. 
 This place practically 
 runs itself. 
 Can one of you look 
 at a suspected hand fracture? 
 Who ordered 
 the films? 
 I did. 
 Everybody was busy. 
 I'll take it. 
 Did you find Alex? 
 Oh, yes, he was ditching school 
 with a friend at the mall. 
 (clicks tongue) 
 I guess I have all that 
 to look forward to, huh? 
 Yep. 
 You saved that guy. 
 It was so cool. 
 You mean ""terrifying."" 
 Dude, you rocked. 
 Did you see the look 
 on Crenshaw's face? 
 The one that suggested 
 he was going to punish me 
 for the rest of my 
 natural life for 
 what I just did? 
 You spanked him. 
 Deep down, I think 
 he probably likes it. 
 (chuckles): 
 Seriously. 
 You know it's always 
 those type-A guys 
 that are so wound up 
 they go home and put on a diaper 
 or want to be led around 
 by a leash. 
 (laughing): 
 You're mad. 
 Hey, Neela. 
 Hey. 
 Um, uh... Ray Barnett. 
 I don't think 
 we've officially met. 
 Katey. 
 Hey. 
 Um, I'm still getting 
 some of your mail. 
 Oh. I'm sorry. 
 I've tried to change 
 everything over. 
 Well, I don't mind. 
 I just figured you might 
 need some of these. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. Uh, I'll see 
 you guys around. 
 It was nice meeting you. 
 You two lived together? 
 Oh, we were roommates. 
 Hope you had benefits. 
 It wasn't like that. 
 We were just friends. 
 Why? That guy 
 is smoking hot. 
 Does he have a girlfriend? 
 Not that I know of. 
 I just remembered something. 
 Um, I'll catch up 
 with you later, okay? 
 Sure. 
 (sighs) 
 Witnesses confirm 
 that the other guy started 
 and you just 
 pushed him away. 
 I told you that. 
 But that doesn't 
 explain touching the kid. 
 I wasn't ""touching"" him. 
 My relationship to the boy 
 is complicated. 
 It's, uh, sort of a secret. 
 No, no, not like that. 
 Well, your hand isn't broken, 
 it's just sprained. 
 It would have been worth 
 a fracture if I would have 
 knocked out that freaky little 
 leprechaun's teeth. 
 What's going to happen 
 to him? 
 He's going to jail. 
 What do you think 
 about that, Max? 
 Wait! 
 Wait! Wait! 
 Don't arrest my dad. 
 What did he say? 
 Max, 
 what's going on? 
 This is where 
 I leave. 
 Good luck 
 with that, Pops. 
 Mom, Mom, this is my dad... 
 Dr. Archie Morris. 
 What's up? 
 PRATT: 
 Hey, Timmy, did you get it? 
 Yeah, but I didn't get 
 a chance to wrap it. 
 Nah, it's all good. 
 (chuckling) 
 Gates! Wow, just the man 
 I was looking for. 
 Here, I got a 
 present for you. 
 What's this for? 
 It's so, uh, people 
 know who you are. 
 Hey. You didn't 
 have to do this. 
 Yeah, I did. 
 Let's see. 
 (chuckles) 
 What the hell is this? 
 (Timmy, Pratt laughing) 
 Students wear 
 short coats. 
 It helps remind 
 everyone, including you, 
 that you are 
 still learning. 
 You feel better now? 
 I feel great, man. Yeah. 
 (laughs) 
 (softly): 
 Gates. 
 (baby crying over monitor) 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 How long has he been crying? 
 About ten minutes. 
 I think he'll 
 settle down. 
 How was your shift? 
 Uh, the usual-- I had a five- 
 year-old kid crushed by a tree. 
 I don't want to hear any stories 
 about bad things 
 happening to children. 
 He survived, okay? 
 How about your day? 
 It was divine. 
 Hmm. 
 Look, I've been thinking. 
 Maybe you're right, 
 maybe we should get somebody 
 like a nanny... 
 No, thanks. 
 But I thought you... 
 I changed my mind. 
 (sighs) 
 No nannies... just us. 
 (baby continues crying) 
 Doesn't sound like 
 he's settling down, hmm? 
 (laughs) 
 I'll get him. 
 (sighs) 
 KOVAC (over monitor): 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 What's all that crying? 
 * Should I stay 
 or should I go now? * 
 * If I stay 
 it will be trouble * 
 * If I go it will be double... * 
 That good, hmm? 
 I should have stayed 
 a paramedic. 
 No. Doctors are much more sexy. 
 (grunts) 
 (chuckles) 
 Rough day? 
 Yeah, one of my attendings 
 has it out for me. 
 Either that 
 or he's in love with me. 
 I can't tell which. 
 How was your temp gig? 
 Same thing, 
 different people. 
 (sighs) 
 Nobody knows you. 
 Nobody really talks to you. 
 It's like being 
 the office ghost. 
 Do you want a drink? 
 No, I have to study. 
 GIRL: 
 Knock-knock. You decent? 
 I'm in my thong. 
 Guess what? 
 I take it your 
 homework is done? 
 Yeah. 
 I've got some stuff 
 from school you need to sign. 
 I left them on the table. 
 All right. 
 There's lasagna in the fridge 
 if you get hungry later. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, you were right 
 about Adam Horner. 
 Oh, yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 I ignored him 
 all day, 
 even when he was looking at 
 me, and tonight he IM'd me. 
 The Horndog comes through. 
 It's Horner. 
 Watch it. 
 I bruise easy. 
 Did you save anyone today? 
 Yes. Actually, I separated 
 a pair of Siamese twins. 
 Must be gross 
 seeing all that blood, huh? 
 Nah, I saw more blood 
 when I was a paramedic. 
 Besides, I'm half vampire, 
 so I kind of dig it. 
 (laughs) 
 Do you want me 
 to help you study? 
 No. I want you to work 
 things out with your mother. 
 I'd rather shave my head. 
 Oh. All right, good, 
 I have a razor 
 in the bathroom, 
 we can shave it 
 into a nice 
 little Mohawk. 
 (laughing): 
 Okay, I'm just kidding. 
 I'll talk to her. 
 Sometime. 
 Tonight? 
 Yeah. 
 Hey. 
 Good night, baby girl. 
 Night, Doc. 
 (over boom box): 
 For the next hour, 
 we're going to be talking 
 about abdominal pain 
 in the elderly patient. 
 Now, I don't have to tell you 
 what an important disease 
 this is... 
 No pass-ons, 
 no major tragedy, no deaths. 
 Gates still here? 
 You just missed him. 
 What about his charts? 
 They're over there. 
 Hey, you know, from what 
 I've seen, cat's a good doctor. 
 Oh, he's all right. 
 Plenty of room 
 for improvement. 
 Dr. Morris, I heard 
 some guy att*cked you. 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, yes, yeah, 
 I turned the other cheek. 
 You know what Jesus said. 
 You know... 
 when the, those guys 
 who trespassed against him, 
 as those who trespassed 
 against us-- 
 can I get an amen? 
 Amen. 
 Amen. 
 I have a patient 
 waiting, so... 
 Good night, Dr. Morris. 
 God bless you. 
 God bless all of us. 
 Hey. 
 You want to grab a bite 
 with me and Max and his moms? 
 You worked things out, huh? 
 Yeah. Yeah, 
 they're pretty cool. 
 And if everything 
 goes well at Ike's, 
 we may really work 
 things out tonight. 
 if you know 
 what I'm saying, 
 Morris... 
 and I think you do. 
 You do know 
 they're a couple, huh? 
 Yeah, a couple 
 of lesbians 
 in desperate need of 
 a Morris sandwich. Unh. 
 You know 
 you're sick, right? 
 What? 
 Good night, Archie. 
 HOPE: 
 Could you help me 
 with a two-layer closure? 
 Nope, nope, not now, I'm off. 
 Weaver should be here 
 any minute now. 
 (sighs) 
 All right, wait, wait, wait. 
 First off, you never want to 
 inject directly into the wound. 
 It distorts the anatomy 
 for your repair. 
 He needs regional 
 anesthesia. 
 Have you ever done 
 an infraorbital block? 
 Not really. 
 Okay, well, it's pretty easy 
 once you know the tricks. 
 Now, first, what 
 you want to do is 
 you want to use your 
 left index finger 
 to palpate the 
 infraorbital ridge. 
 Got it. 
 Good. 
 Now you're going to 
 inject one centimeter 
 lateral to the ala 
 and advance upward 
 until you're five millimeters 
 from the ridge. 
 Good, good, very good.","[""the woman she works for. \n Oh. \n Wow, that's... \n What's she going to do? \n I told her to \n have an abortion. \n That's what I did. \n You got pregnant \n with the husband \n of the woman you work for, too? \n It ""]",True

 - Oh, yeah. 
 Okay, come on, everybody. 
 Keep it going. 
 We're almost there. Keep it going. 
 Come on, Sam. You're doing good. 
 Come on. 
 I was at mile five, 
 but this is a little too much. 
 You got to run on your toes. 
 You land on the flat of your feet. 
 - Are you seeing stars yet? 
 - No. 
 I'm seeing a bench. 
 A bench with a pillow. 
 Great job, everybody. 
 Same drill tomorrow at 5 a. m. 
 - Next week, we add the bicycle. 
 - No. 
 No on the bicycle. 
 This is triathlon training, Sam. 
 Bike, swim, run. 
 How about a shower, or drink, nap? 
 That's more my speed. 
 Sam, you okay? 
 No. I need a gurney. 
 - I'll tell them to send one out for you. 
 And some O2. 
 Tell them everything 
 you've ever implemented. 
 Document compliance, 
 medication reconciliation. 
 - Mention when I went to Africa? 
 - Of course. 
 - Tell them how good you are in bed too. 
 - I should've worn that suit. 
 - This one's fine. 
 - Are these pants wrinkly? 
 All right, I'm wigging out. 
 I don't know why. 
 You are gonna rock this. I know it. 
 Pratt, can you give me a hand? 
 I've got a meeting 
 with Anspaugh. Get Skye. 
 This is Beth Ackerman, 22. Fell down 
 the escalator at Bloomingdale's. 
 It was 50 percent off suede boots. 
 - I'm Dr. Gates, are you in pain? 
 - Yeah, my ankle's k*lling me. 
 Deformity and point tenderness 
 over the distal tib-fib. 
 - She said her stomach hurts too. 
 - We'll take a look. 
 - She took a pretty good fall. 
 I didn't break that glass vase, did I? 
 Sam, you're running a little late here. 
 I'll be ready in a minute. 
 - You okay? 
 - Oh, she's fine. 
 - Yeah? 
 - You're fine, right? 
 Shut up. 
 And the truth is, 
 I'm not some Ivy League import. 
 I trained here 
 as a med student and a resident. 
 I know that ER better 
 than any other candidate. 
 I've been nominated 
 for a med school teaching award. 
 I'm efficient. 
 And I understand the need 
 to balance teaching with productivity. 
 I'm the fastest attending on the floor, 
 and I have the records to prove it. 
 - What else would you want in a chief? 
 - Experience. 
 Come on, you've hired experience. 
 And all you got out of it 
 was a mental breakdown... 
 ...and another guy 
 who didn't last three months. 
 I love your chutzpah. 
 I've told you this, but I don't see it. 
 You don't see what? 
 Some people are leaders, Dr. Pratt. 
 Some people aren't. 
 - Dr. Anspaugh, with... 
 - I have talked to your supervisors. 
 Yes, Kovac told you 
 to go to Africa, and you did it. 
 Kovac also told you what to change 
 in the ER. You did that too. 
 But, without prompting, 
 what have you done here? 
 In order to overlook 
 these candidates... 
 ...I would have to see 
 that you are an undeniable choice. 
 And I'm not convinced. 
 Maybe I shouldn't be here at all. 
 - Dr. Pratt... 
 - No, I've been busting my butt. 
 If you don't see that, 
 why should I waste my time here? 
 So you're going to give up 
 if you don't get this? 
 No. 
 I'm gonna go somewhere I'm respected. 
 And my efforts aren't in vain. 
 Consider this my two weeks notice. 
 I think you're overreacting. 
 If they're so hung up on status quo, 
 why spend another day here? 
 - This is your family. 
 - No, my Aunt Ellen's family. 
 This is business. 
 Look, Morris, I love you guys. 
 I really do. 
 - But this isn't right. 
 What happened? 
 - Your people getting oppressed? 
 - Shut up, Frank. 
 They didn't say you'll never get it. 
 They said not now. 
 You think 
 Anspaugh will make you chief? 
 If I leave and jam at another hospital, 
 he'll change his mind. 
 - Then what? You'll come back? 
 - Hell, no. 
 - Fight the power. 
 - Shut up, Frank. 
 - Dr. Pratt, can you jump on this? 
 - Yeah. 
 Eight-year-old, head lac, 
 seems altered. 
 And you are? 
 Teacher's aide. 
 He fell in gym class. 
 - Did he pass out? 
 - I wasn't there. 
 They told me to bring him in. 
 Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt. What's your name? 
 My head hurts. 
 We're gonna get you checked out. 
 Exam 3. 
 What labs do you want? 
 - CBC for a baseline. 
 We were leaving the store. 
 She wanted me to take her home, 
 but she was in pain. 
 - Where do you live? 
 In Harvey. 
 Jack got us a weekend special. 
 We saw ""Jersey Boys"" last night. 
 Capped it off with a couple martinis. 
 Six, to be exact. 
 Sounds like fun. Special occasion? 
 Beth, can you take 
 a deep breath for me? 
 Yeah, she got back from a tour in Iraq 
 two weeks ago. 
 How long were you there? 
 Thirteen months. 
 Going back in six weeks. 
 - You military too? 
 - Marines. 
 After 9/11, they sent me to Guam. 
 - What's happening in Guam? 
 - Not enough. 
 - Any allergies? 
 - Walnuts. 
 That's about it. 
 Okay, a little stick here. 
 Looking better 
 than the last time I saw you. 
 - I was a little winded. 
 - A little winded. 
 You were sucking air like a dry guppy. 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, she has some tenderness 
 in the left lower quadrant. 
 Follow exams. 
 Make sure Trauma takes a look. 
 Okay. 
 I need you to go to Admit, 
 and fill out some paperwork. 
 No problem. 
 - Honey, I'll be right back, okay? 
 - I'm not going anywhere. 
 The icon's positive. 
 What does that mean? 
 You're pregnant. 
 One, two, supermodel. 
 Oh, that's fabulous. 
 Neela's like my hero. 
 She moved to America, 
 and she took it by the balls. 
 Yeah, she does have a way. 
 The rest of our family, 
 they have a stick up their bottoms. 
 But Neela said bollocks to tradition, 
 and she moved to the States. 
 - She's like our own Mick Jagger. 
 - I don't know. 
 More of a backup singer. 
 You know, like a Pip. 
 - I being Gladys, she being a Pip. 
 - Hi, sorry. 
 Radiology wanted me to stay in CT 
 with our diverticulitis guy. 
 We don't handhold here, Harold. 
 Let Radiology do their own job. 
 Harold, I'd like you 
 to meet my cousin, Jaspreet. 
 Hi, ""I'm... "" 
 - Harold, you're Harold. 
 - Right. 
 - Some people call me Jazz. 
 - I love jazz. 
 - Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie. 
 - Gillespie? 
 - Green Mill's the place for that. 
 - We should go sometime. 
 Really? 
 So you and me? 
 What's wrong with this guy? 
 He's having an asthma attack. 
 Somebody get an inhaler. 
 You're gonna feel 
 a little bit of a sting here. 
 Ow. 
 This is the numbing shot 
 for your stitches. 
 It hurts. 
 It will get easier after this. 
 Where do you think you'll go? 
 I'll call Northwestern. 
 They wanted me once. 
 Maybe they'll want me again. 
 You feel that? 
 Feel what? 
 Good. 
 I'll start stitching you up now, okay? 
 How many will I get? 
 About five. 
 Can you make it six? 
 I want one more than my friend Lucas. 
 All right, I'll see what I can do. 
 CT's backed up. 
 They said to call back in a half hour. 
 This place needs a second scanner. 
 Carlos, do you remember 
 how this happened? 
 I don't know. 
 I was playing kickball and fell. 
 Were you feeling sick today? 
 - No. 
 - Are you taking any medicine? 
 Epzicom, didanosine and Kaletra. 
 Those medicines are for HIV. 
 How long's your asthma? 
 I think it happened 
 because of my psychosexual stress. 
 Psychosexual what? 
 It's rare. 
 They don't teach it in med school. 
 - She's single? 
 - She ran away from marriage. 
 - Sweet. 
 - Harold, she's not for you. 
 She's a sex-crazed maniac. 
 Okay, come on. 
 Enough with the babying. 
 Neela and I have a rectal abscess, 
 and a woman versus escalator. 
 - Can I do the I and D? 
 - No. 
 No, Neela and I 
 are gonna cover the ER. 
 I got a lot of consults piling up, 
 and wanna keep the team. 
 - What should I do? 
 - You can deflate your little balloon. 
 And then take Bollywood 
 out there for a tour. 
 Okay. This is the uterus. 
 And there's the baby. 
 Are you sure? 
 Mm-hm. Look, 
 there's the heartbeat right there. 
 Hey, I called your sister 
 and told her everything's gonna be okay. 
 What's up? What are they doing? 
 An ultrasound. 
 Why? What's going on? 
 I'm pregnant. 
 You're what? 
 Oh, my God. 
 - Oh, we're pregnant. 
 - Yeah, pregnant. 
 Gonna be an adorable baby. 
 I can tell already. 
 - What? Are these the arms right there? 
 Yep. 
 And there's the fingers and toes. 
 So it's about eight weeks old. 
 - Eight weeks? 
 Mm-hm. At least. 
 The OB will do a formal ultrasound. 
 Give you a more accurate estimate. 
 Trauma's here. 
 This the escalator fall, 
 Beth Ackerman? 
 Yeah. 
 Hello. I'm Dr. Rasgotra from Surgery. 
 Does anything hurt? 
 Sounds like he wants you to be 
 more proactive with your own ideas. 
 I'll take my ideas to another hospital. 
 Thank you. 
 I never liked Anspaugh. 
 Well, if you need help looking, 
 I can make some calls. 
 If I can't find a job fast enough, 
 I might need a sugar momma. 
 Oh, maybe we can work 
 something out. 
 - I can cook and clean. 
 I'll take that into consideration. 
 Dawn, 
 did Carlos Moore's mom get in? 
 I left a message. 
 Her phone keeps going to voice mail. 
 Try it again. 
 She needs to know her kid is here. 
 Just because a boy steps 
 to me doesn't mean I'm gonna tell. 
 - That is not right. 
 - What would you do? 
 You gotta be up-front. 
 - Tell him what's up. 
 - Because he asked? 
 This is about being honest. 
 Damn, if that's the ""case... "" 
 ""... I'll"" be telling people all day 
 that I'm Hlv-positive. 
 The truth is, you're both right. 
 It is important to be honest. 
 But every guy you meet 
 doesn't need to know. 
 However, men you plan 
 to be intimate with do need to know. 
 Even if he just wants to kiss you? 
 Jeanie, it's Carlos. 
 - What? 
 - They called. He's at County. 
 Ladies, I need to cut this short. 
 Is there anything we can do? 
 - No. Thanks. I left Sydney's prescription. 
 No problem. I got it. 
 We got a 52-year-old diabetic 
 with a non-healing ulcer on the foot. 
 - What's his glucose? 
 - Eighty-nine. 
 - Excuse me, is triage still in here? 
 - Yeah, check in at the desk. 
 My kid was brought in 
 about an hour ago. 
 - You have to sign in. 
 - His name's Carlos Moore. 
 - I need to know what room. 
 - I'll be with you in a minute. 
 This guy needs a foot series 
 and a CBC. 
 Please, just look it up for me. 
 Hey. Hey, get back here. 
 I told her to wait. 
 What room is Carlos Moore in? 
 Carlos Moore. 
 - Ma'am, you need to sign in. 
 Jeanie? 
 - Hey, Chuny. 
 - What are you doing here? 
 - It's Carlos. He fell. 
 - You know her? 
 - Yeah, she used to work here. 
 - How are you? 
 - I'm good. 
 - Will you help me? 
 - Yeah. 
 Exam 3. He's Dr. Pratt's case. 
 Come on, I'll show you. 
 The ER has changed a bit. 
 - How have you been? 
 - Good. You look the same. 
 - Oh, you look great too. 
 - Hey, there you are. 
 Hey. Are you okay? 
 Were you spacing out during kickball? 
 I guess. It's so boring. 
 Yeah, I know. It doesn't look too bad. 
 Jeanie Boulet. She's Carlos' mom. 
 She was a PA on staff. 
 Oh, good. I'm Dr. Pratt. 
 We're about to take him up 
 to get a CT. 
 Really? He needs a CT? 
 Possible loss of consciousness. 
 Possible? Doesn't the school know? 
 The aide wasn't sure, and I wanna 
 play it safe and get the scan anyway. 
 - Is Dr. Weaver here? I know her. 
 - No. She doesn't work here anymore. 
 Carlos is a bit more complicated 
 than other kids. 
 I know. He told me about the HIV. 
 No offense, but I'd feel better with the 
 most senior person taking care of him. 
 He hit his head. And I have a lot 
 of experience managing head trauma. 
 I'm not trying to be disrespectful. 
 But would it be possible for me 
 to speak to your attending? 
 Ma'am, I am the attending. 
 - Hemoglobin's stable. 
 - I'm not getting anything here. 
 Your fractured bones 
 are blocking the blood flow. 
 - I'm gonna need to realign them. 
 Oh, whatever. 
 I just don't get it. 
 Jack, we'll talk about this 
 when it's over. L... 
 Propofol's kicking in. 
 Good sats. 
 Let's stabilize posteriorly. 
 Okay, ready. On three. 
 One, two, three. 
 Whoa, whoa, 
 what's going on, Dr. Rasgotra? 
 Displaced tib-fib. 
 - I don't recall having orthopedic training. 
 - Well, no. 
 Typically, the ER waits for the Ortho team 
 before reducing unstable fractures. 
 - Had no choice. 
 - We lost the dorsalis pulse. 
 - And now it's back. 
 Really? 
 Oh. You must have 
 some set of hands, girl. 
 Call us when you've got film. 
 Go. We got a femur in 2. 
 I really would prefer an MRI. 
 A CT will give us the information. 
 Maybe, but it involves radiation. 
 He doesn't need that. 
 An MRI takes longer, and not 
 as good for finding a traumatic bleed. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 I know, honey. 
 I just wanna do the right thing. 
 This is the right thing. 
 We can do the CT quickly 
 and without sedation. 
 And if you wanna stay, you have 
 to wear one of these lead aprons. 
 If not, 
 you can wait in the Control Room. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 This isn't gonna hurt, honey. 
 I know. 
 You ready, Carlos? 
 I'll be right here. 
 It will be over before you know it. 
 That reduction was impressive. 
 Let's not congratulate ourselves 
 until we see the film. 
 Is it over? 
 Your bones are in place. 
 Need to wrap and repeat x-ray. 
 How do you feel? 
 I'm okay. 
 Who is he? 
 It's not what you think. 
 Was he someone in your squad? 
 Was he an officer? 
 Was it a journalist? 
 The guy you wrote me about? 
 - Now's really not the time. 
 - No, Jack. 
 Explain to me how you've been home 
 two weeks and are two months pregnant. 
 Because I was r*ped. 
 Kyle... 
 Kyle Petterson r*ped me. 
 Your sergeant? 
 You were laughing with him 
 when you got off. 
 - I saw you. 
 - He did it, Jack. 
 - You're lying. 
 - It's true. 
 - Stay still. 
 - You're covering someone you screwed. 
 - Why don't you go outside, calm down. 
 - Hey, get off of me. 
 Jack. 
 - God. 
 - I'd wait a year or so. 
 - Jobs are tight. 
 - No, the housing market's tight. 
 People always need doctors. 
 Hey, I'd pimp my dog 
 if it will get you to stay. 
 Why don't you pimp a few charts, 
 and clear the board? We're packed. 
 - You should put Abby back. 
 - She's taking some personal time. 
 Still? It's been weeks now. 
 So what? She'll come back. 
 I saw your nephrotic syndrome patient. 
 Consult's on the chart. 
 Thank you, Dr. Daniels. 
 Oh, hey, hey, hey. 
 - How'd he do? 
 - He handled it like a champ. 
 Oh, good. I'll find you 
 as soon as I get the results. 
 Okay. 
 Michael Grant from Northwestern. 
 - Oh, hey. 
 - Whoa, whoa, you called already? 
 You snooze, you lose. 
 - Hello? 
 ""Dr. Pratt?"" 
 - Yeah. 
 - I'll take the neck. 
 You talk some sense into him. 
 Oh, and this is the desk. 
 It's kind of like the epicenter where... 
 Where senior attendings 
 like myself create the action. 
 More like the chaos. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin. 
 Oh, I'm Archie Morris, Neela's friend. 
 Not to be confused with boyfriend, 
 because we've never dated. 
 Why wouldn't I know? 
 Okay, Dr. Morris, 
 Jaspreet and I need to finish the tour. 
 Oh, tour? Tour? 
 Where has young Henry taken you? 
 - It's Harold. 
 - Whatever. 
 We went to the O.R., 
 and saw this guy carrying a heart. 
 It was so cool. 
 Then we saw this awesome MRI scan, 
 and saw pictures of this chick's brain. 
 We went to the morgue, 
 and saw this dead body. 
 And this thing was dead, 
 as in dead, dead. 
 Wow. Did he take you to the trauma room 
 where senior attendings save lives? 
 No. But I'd love to see that. 
 Would you? My pleasure. 
 Wait, wait. 
 - Excuse me. 
 But I haven't even taken you 
 to the pathology lab yet. 
 We must have been asleep 
 about two hours when he came in. 
 First, I thought 
 we were being att*cked. 
 That's why he was there. 
 But then he got on top of me, 
 and put his hand over my mouth... 
 ...and told me to be quiet, and I froze. 
 Did you tell anyone? 
 The next day, we were out on patrol 
 looking for insurgents. 
 What was I supposed to do? 
 I needed those guys to have my back. 
 - Still, he should be punished. 
 - It's too late. 
 I pretended it didn't happen. 
 Like Jack said, 
 I was laughing with him. 
 It doesn't matter. 
 I've been through it. 
 Holding it in gives you nothing 
 but nightmares and panic att*cks. 
 I heard Jeanie Boulet 
 was in the house. 
 Oh, hi. 
 Oh, my, look at you. You look great. 
 Oh, you do too. 
 Alex, do you remember Carlos? 
 You were this small when we met. 
 - How you feeling? 
 - Okay. 
 I got a CT. 
 About 45 minutes ago. I wonder 
 if they've processed the films yet. 
 - Who was helping you? 
 - Dr. Pratt. 
 Let's go find out 
 if the radiologist has them. 
 Okay. I'll go with you. 
 You all right? 
 Back in a few minutes. 
 So, what's going on? 
 Are you still running the same clinic? 
 One on the South side, 
 one on the North. 
 How's Reggie? 
 Did he finally make detective? 
 Yeah. He sure did. 
 We separated two years ago. 
 Oh, don't tell me that. 
 He just... It was too much for him. 
 I'm at the clinic 24/7. 
 - Oh, so you're still close? 
 - Joint custody. 
 It's good for all of us. 
 - Have you heard from Doug and Carol? 
 - Oh, they are still loving Seattle. 
 Dr. Ross sent a picture of the twins. 
 - They just started third grade. 
 - Wow. I keep saying I'm gonna visit. 
 And how's Carter? 
 Is he still in Africa? 
 I heard he might be coming home 
 for a visit in the spring. 
 I should have everybody over 
 for gumbo and ?touff?e. 
 Do that. We'll get together 
 like the good old days. 
 Has anyone seen Dr. Pratt? 
 He's at the Jumbo Mart having coffee. 
 I was just hoping I could get 
 my son's CT results, and get him home. 
 I'll give them a call. 
 Name's Carlos Moore. 
 Line's busy. 
 They've been slow all day. 
 - I'll go upstairs, see what's taking them. 
 - Thanks a lot. 
 I started making up 
 the schedule myself. 
 Before I knew it, 
 I was arranging teaching conferences... 
 ...reorganizing the appointment grid. 
 Yeah, well, that's just great. 
 But Anspaugh doesn't believe in me. 
 You heard it yourself. 
 It's not about Anspaugh. 
 It's about you. 
 Make it so they can't deny you this. 
 Look, there are some 
 Physician Leadership Programs... 
 ...over at U of C, 
 coming up in about a month. 
 They might give some ideas. 
 Why would I have to jump 
 when Northwestern said... 
 ...they'd die to have someone like me? 
 You think you're gonna walk 
 and run the place? 
 The head of the department is looking 
 for someone to mentor to replace him. 
 He wants to meet tomorrow. 
 You know, Dr. Pratt, when a fighter gets 
 knocked down in the first round... 
 ""... he"" doesn't throw in the towel. 
 I'm not throwing in the towel. 
 I'm getting into another ring. 
 Excuse me. 
 Dr. Pratt. 
 Yeah. 
 Why is she up there? 
 No. 
 Yeah. Okay, thanks. 
 I gotta take care of this. 
 Dr. Pratt, think about what I said. 
 Having you run this department, 
 that would be phenomenal. 
 - Have you seen our soldier's boyfriend? 
 - Who body slammed me? 
 - I'm not gonna send a search party. 
 - Yeah, you need to toughen up. 
 - You should come running with us. 
 - I lift weights, Sam. 
 I'm not into t*rture. 
 So why are you doing all this? 
 I don't know. I'm trying 
 to get out there a little bit more. 
 I'm taking wine tasting too. 
 - What's funny? 
 - Oh, I don't know. 
 I was just remembering a dream 
 I had last night. 
 Sam was in it. 
 I was? What was I doing? 
 - Hey, Sam, have you seen Dr. Wexler? 
 - Not in a while. 
 Hey, what was I doing, Gates? 
 Hey, hey, are those my films? 
 Yeah. I went to light a fire. 
 Yeah, you should've paged me first. 
 - I was trying to help. 
 - That wasn't the way to do it. 
 - Ms. Boulet? 
 - Dr. Pratt, we should talk. 
 - Yeah, later. 
 - But, Dr. Pratt. 
 What is it? 
 Mind if we go talk 
 in the doctor's lounge? 
 No, I've waited long enough. 
 Just give me the results. 
 There's a lesion by the frontal horn 
 of the left ventricle. 
 From the fall? 
 It's contrast enhancing 
 with surrounding edema. 
 No, it's not from the head injury. 
 Then, what is it? 
 Could be a few possibilities. 
 It could be toxoplasmosis, 
 CNS lymphoma, histoplasmosis. 
 Meaning AIDS. 
 My son has AIDS. 
 I never would've told her like that 
 had you not gone up there. 
 - You're blaming this on me? 
 - You went behind my back. 
 You're acting like I slept with 
 your girlfriend. I was helping you out. 
 I don't need it. 
 Had I gotten the results myself, 
 I would have pulled her. 
 Or if you had taken a second 
 to talk to me... 
 Because of you, what should have been 
 a private conversation happened here. 
 You know what, Dr. Pratt? 
 You don't get it. 
 What don't I get? 
 A micromanager in complete denial? 
 This should be a team. 
 Shouldn't be working autonomously. 
 Please, give me a break, okay? 
 I came up on this team. 
 Now, the next time you're bored 
 and you need something to do... 
 ...try treating a patient. 
 Your own. 
 Chief. 
 He'd done so well for so long. 
 Then, over the last year, 
 his CD4 counts dropped. 
 They changed his antiretrovirals twice, 
 because the virus became resistant. 
 Let's just see 
 what the doctors have planned. 
 There are all types 
 of new treatments now. 
 Haleh's right. 
 Even if it means Carlos has AIDS... 
 ...survival has improved 
 over the last decade. 
 Please don't lecture me. 
 I'm Hlv-positive. I know all about it. 
 But it's different when it's your own kid. 
 I know that. 
 It's so surreal happening here. 
 It's where I met Carlos. 
 Where I decided to adopt him. 
 We don't know 
 what this brain lesion is. 
 If it's toxoplasmosis, 
 it'll get better with antibiotics. 
 And if it's a lymphoma? 
 - Then there's chemo. 
 - You know that doesn't work. 
 If it's a lymphoma, he's got months. 
 Why don't we just find out 
 what it is first? 
 How will we do that? 
 There's no simple way. 
 The only way to know for sure 
 is to do a biopsy. 
 Cut into his brain? 
 The neurosurgeon can do it 
 stereotactically with a needle... 
 ...under CT guidance. 
 I don't know. 
 It's the best way. 
 Ms. Boulet, 
 a Reggie Moore is here to see you. 
 It's Carlos' father. I gotta go. 
 Hey. 
 Bam, you're out. 
 - What are you doing? 
 Playing four square. 
 I don't even know how you play. 
 - Hey. Oh, okay, all right. 
 Let's keep it moving. 
 Go inside, guys. Game's over. 
 Jerk. 
 - They're not patients. I pulled them. 
 You whip that thing one more time, 
 I'll be sewing up their head lacs. 
 Get in. 
 The box, get in. 
 Get in. 
 What is your problem? 
 Why are you so agitated? 
 Morris stole my girl. 
 Your girl? 
 Jaspreet? 
 Two guys have taken my women 
 in the past two months, I'm sick of it. 
 Across the way, 
 we have the Jumbo Mart. 
 Down the street is Ike's, 
 a very fine establishment. 
 And there's the el, 
 which can take you anywhere. 
 That's so cool. 
 Hey, Neela, Jaspreet and I 
 were gonna grab some drinks. 
 - You down? 
 - Well, actually, I was... 
 Yeah, we're in. Double dates. 
 Be there. 
 Harold, come on, let's go. Come on. 
 How are we gonna tell him? 
 Let's just talk about the mass. 
 What about the AIDS? 
 You wanna tell him about that? 
 We should take it 
 just one step at a time. 
 - You wanna start lying to him now? 
 - It's not lying. 
 - With all due respect... 
 - I know what I'm doing. 
 You're the specialist. 
 You have the answers. 
 Think this is easy? 
 - Patients have the right to know. 
 - He's my kid. 
 He's mine too. 
 You don't think he reads? 
 You don't think he listens to your calls? 
 Carlos knows 
 what an AIDS-defining illness is. 
 Just give her a minute. 
 Yeah, she's stubborn. 
 It's either her way or no way. 
 Hey, Sam. 
 Did Ortho see the post reduction film 
 on the pregnant soldier? 
 - They signed off on it. 
 - Good. 
 Listen, I'm sorry to hear 
 about what you went through. 
 Oh, yeah. Well, I appreciate that. 
 But I don't think it's appropriate to share 
 that personal stuff with the patients. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - They're dealing with their crisis. 
 They don't need to listen to ours. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, doc. 
 I thought you split. 
 How's Beth? 
 How do you think? 
 I don't believe her. 
 - Well, you think she's telling the truth? 
 - Yeah, I do. 
 Doesn't matter what I think. 
 I was always afraid 
 of her stepping on an IED... 
 ...or getting k*lled by a sn*per. 
 But something like this... 
 We shouldn't have to worry 
 about our guys. 
 We're all supposed to be there 
 defending our country. 
 You're right about that. 
 But start by defending her. 
 What kind of spot? 
 Well, we're not sure. 
 It could be caused by some germs. 
 Or it could be something else. 
 Can they take it out? 
 It's not that easy. 
 They have to do 
 some more tests first. 
 What kind of tests? 
 What we wanna do 
 is just take a little piece out... 
 ...and look at it under a microscope. 
 You mean, I have a tumor? 
 Remember I told you? 
 God helps us 
 through the good times and the bad. 
 Well, we have to have faith. 
 He's gonna hold our hands 
 through this. 
 All of us together, buddy. 
 Carlos? 
 Hey, Carlos. Carlos? 
 - What's happening? 
 - Push 2 of lorazepam right now. 
 - Second two didn't touch him. 
 - He's maxed out on lorazepam. 
 What next? 
 Pentobarb. 
 - You wanna go straight to pentobarb? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Pulse is up to 165. 
 Oh, God. 
 Try Depakote. 
 Nope, it takes too long. 
 Get Pede's neuro down here. 
 Why? 
 He's got elevated ICP, and failed 
 first-line dr*gs. A no-brainer. 
 I'd like to get a consult 
 before you induce a coma. 
 - Coma? No, no way. 
 - We should avoid intubation. 
 Gonna need general anesthesia 
 for the biopsy. 
 Sat's dropping, 87. 
 All right, call respiratory. 
 Prep a 6-oh-ET tube. 
 That's excessive. 
 - He needs an anticonvulsant. 
 Pentobarbital, 300 milligrams IV. 
 Haleh, now. 
 - All right, I'm in. Bag him up. 
 - What about an EEG? 
 They'll do it in O.R. 
 Pentobarb drip at 30 migs... 
 - Does he need steroids? 
 - I was ordering six of Decadron. 
 - What's that for? 
 - To reduce the swelling. 
 - You staying while he's in surgery? 
 - I'm not going anywhere. 
 - Well done, Greg. 
 They're ready for him in O.R. 
 Hey. 
 - What's up? 
 - Beth's boyfriend never made it back. 
 - Yeah, I saw him outside. 
 I tried to talk to him, 
 but I wasn't persuasive. 
 You, not persuasive? 
 I thought you're a sweet talker. 
 Well, I guess even this situation 
 was beyond me. 
 Guess again. 
 He came back. Well, I knew he would. 
 I just wanna make sure that you knew 
 that I knew that, you know... 
 - How you doing? 
 I'm better now. 
 - How's the ankle? 
 - The splint's really helping. 
 Gotta keep it elevated, okay? 
 - Okay. 
 When can I get her out of here? 
 Soon. 
 I just wanted to talk to you 
 about pregnancy options. 
 You know, 
 I can make a call to the gynecologist... 
 ...and you can have a D and C done 
 as early as tomorrow. 
 I'm not getting an abortion. 
 You wanna have this baby? 
 Beth, I don't understand. 
 Let me call a counselor down here 
 to talk to you. 
 I'm gonna keep it. 
 Pregnant soldiers don't get sent back. 
 I love ""Earth"" and ""Veer-Zaara. "" 
 They're epic. 
 Since when did you follow 
 Bollywood movies? 
 Since he went on the Internet 
 20 minutes ago. 
 Truth is, 
 I don't really watch Indian films. 
 When you go home to the motherland, 
 you've caught a few? 
 I've never actually been to India. 
 Not every Indian person 
 has been to India. 
 Like assuming every African-American 
 has been to Africa. 
 Well, I mean, just assumed. 
 Arranged marriages, India. Hello? 
 - You assumed wrong, butt-head. 
 - Bite me. 
 Rasgotra. You buying? 
 Dr. Grossman. 
 I'll be right back. 
 I hope you're cool about earlier. 
 What? About how you stole our case? 
 I was trying to be proactive. 
 That's what my girlfriend said 
 when she moved out. 
 I'm joking, Rasgotra. 
 I love proactivity. 
 In fact, how would you feel 
 about an ortho rotation? 
 - Really? 
 - Mm-hm. 
 Well, I'm flattered. 
 - I'll have to talk to Dr. Dubenko first. 
 - I already did that. 
 You have a surgical-elective requirement, 
 so now you're all mine. 
 - Really? 
 - Mm-hm. 
 And he's gonna just let me out 
 that easily? 
 You're gonna be with the cool kids 
 next week. Be ready. 
 I'm pretty tough. 
 - Having the baby is not the answer. 
 - Beth, there are other ways. 
 I am not going back over there. 
 - I don't believe in it anymore. 
 So report him. 
 I can't prove anything. 
 What if he's hurting other people too? 
 Think about that. 
 Yeah, he's right. 
 I know it's scary, but you can do it. 
 I love you. And I support you. 
 The last thing that I'm gonna do 
 is let anything else bad happen to you... 
 ...including going back over there. 
 I promise. 
 Okay. 
 - Yeah. 
 - What are you looking at? 
 You fools. 
 Neela's crazy cousin took these. 
 We are the most idiotic, 
 dysfunctional family ever. 
 If anybody's looking for me, 
 I'll be upstairs. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Hey. 
 They're still working on him. 
 I was gonna go get some coffee. 
 You okay? 
 That's our boy. 
 I mean, she can sit there and watch it. 
 I can't. 
 I know it's tough 
 seeing your kid in there like that. 
 You would think her getting HIV 
 would've crippled her. 
 But she turned it into a mission. 
 The clinics, the patients. 
 If she's not mentoring someone, 
 she's following up with a ""teenager... "" 
 ...making sure 
 they're taking their medicine. 
 She seems pretty committed. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, she sure is. 
 If you have any questions 
 or you need anything... 
 ...don't hesitate to page me. 
 Aren't you supposed to tell me 
 everything's gonna be all right? 
 Hang in there, my friend. 
 Ice is all you can do. 
 Are you sure you can't give me 
 some more tips over dinner? 
 What? I thought it was pretty good 
 when we're hanging out. 
 - It was, but... 
 - Oh, don't tell me. 
 - You hooked up with an elf? 
 - No. 
 I was kind of bummed you didn't call. 
 I went home to D.C. 
 Got tied up with the family. 
 But, look, this weekend, we could catch 
 a movie, get some drinks. 
 Sounds good. 
 What happened to the cop? 
 I thought he was your new lover. 
 - We're dating, we're not married. 
 - So this is a modern thing. 
 - Juggle more than one guy? 
 - Men do it all the time. 
 - Wanna hear about my dream? 
 - Not particularly. 
 - Earlier, you were begging for it. 
 - I don't beg. 
 In my dream you did. 
 - Ew! Was it sexual? 
 - Ew. No, it wasn't. 
 You were begging to do my laundry. 
 Bye, Tony. 
 You washed one load, eight times. 
 - You're insane. 
 - What do you think? 
 You think you're like a clean freak 
 or something? 
 The biopsy's going well. 
 They've localized the lesion 
 and are getting tissue. 
 His vitals are great. 
 He hasn't had 
 any more seizure activity. 
 Jeanie, that's good news. 
 It's just the beginning. 
 He'll fight. He's a tough kid. 
 When I tested positive 12 years ago... 
 ...people were so freaked by it. 
 Some of the doctors didn't think 
 I should work here anymore. 
 The nurses had problems with it too. 
 Even my family. 
 I would go home for Christmas, 
 and I'd hear my aunts talking: 
 ""Well, at least 
 she doesn't have AIDS, girl. 
 We'd have to sit her 
 in the other room to eat. "" 
 I don't want Carlos to go through that. 
 He doesn't deserve it. 
 You'll make sure that doesn't happen. 
 You know what scares me 
 about all this? 
 What if everything I've been fighting for 
 is a bunch of bull? 
 It's not. 
 I tell my patients 
 they won't end up here, but they do. 
 My ex, Al, died two years ago. 
 He was 78 pounds. 
 He didn't even recognize me. 
 And my friend Paulette. 
 She's the first person I met. 
 - Ms. Boulet... 
 - If I lose him, I'm done with it. 
 Don't say that. 
 It's true. I won't do it anymore. 
 You have to. 
 Do it for Carlos. 
 Do it for yourself. 
 But whatever you decide, 
 you keep doing it... 
 ...because you are exactly 
 what we need. 
 You're not so bad, Dr. Pratt. 
 I know. 
 It usually takes people a while, 
 but I eventually win them over. 
 I wanna say a prayer for him. 
 Say one for us both. 
 All right. 
 Dr. Daniels. 
 Yeah, it's Dr. Pratt. 
 I was thinking 
 about what you said earlier, and... 
 Yeah. 
 I'm gonna stick around for round two.

 Everything is different. 
 Then, we were roomies, pals, buddies, and now we're... a real thing. 
 A better thing, for sure, but also more complicated. 
 We're the same people in the same place doing the same things. 
 It's bigger than that, Shaun.

 Ugh!

 You figure she shouldn't page you? 
 She can handle it on her own because she used to be a surgical resident? 
 Be the bigger person. 
 It's an ingrown hair. 
 Mmm. 
 Definitely an ingrown hair. 
 Unfortunately, the ingrown hair caused an abscess that needs to be lanced. 
 By a surgeon. 
 Please give this man the VIP treatment. 
 I have another case to attend to, but don't worry. 
 I'll be checking in. 
 Such a nice lady. 
 (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) 
 So, how shall we proceed? 
 I'm going with ""drain the abscess and dress the wound."" 
 Set it up. 
 Maybe we should do a biopsy? 
 Well, it could be a cutaneous pili migrans or have a deep sinus tract or a creeping eruption caused by a parasitic disease. 
 Give him the VIP treatment. 
 Abdominal pain can be scary when you're pregnant. 
 But I wouldn't worry. 
 You have two rambunctious boys. 
 I know. 
 It's like a cage match in here. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Shaun, where's your first-year resident? 
 I have two first-year residents, but I don't want to teach them. 
 They're very distracting. 
 You have a dizygotic, dichorionic, diamniotic pregnancy. 
 It just means your twins are fraternal and in separate amniotic sacs. 
 First-years aren't distractions. 
 They're godsends. 
 She has edema. 
 Not surprising for someone who's weeks pregnant. 
 They'll do anything you want.

 - ...laundry, apple runs. 
 I already did that.

 - Normal. 
 BP's no longer normal. 
 She's hypertensive. 
 What does that mean, Dr. 
 Murray? 
 Is your vision blurred? 
 A bit. 
 I'm tired. 
 Sounds like preeclampsia. 
 If we don't get your BP down ASAP, you could lose your pregnancy. 
 We need to start you on anti-hypertensive meds, but your edema makes it difficult to place an IV, so we need to run a central line.

 Fetal heart rate's dropping. 
 But only one of them. 
 Did you have another birth? 
 - No. 
 - Any pregnancy? 
 Miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth? 
 I had an abortion when I was   . 
 It's not preeclampsia. 
 One fetus is Rh-positive, and the mother is Rh-negative, and her body is perceiving him as a threat and attacking him with antibodies. 
 Antibodies she could only have if she had an earlier pregnancy. 
 My body is trying to k*ll one of my babies? 
 Yes. 
 Waiting on Billy's biopsy results? 
 To confirm an ingrown hair? 
 You grew up in a Hasidic family, right? 
 How are they handling you being a doctor? 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 I haven't spoken to them in     four years, except one sister. 
 I chose not to live by their rules. 
 I... 
 I knew the consequences. 
 My dad was a real estate agent, obsessed with two completely unrelated things, teeth and taxes. 
 Thought I'd spend the rest of my life selling condos. 
 Now I'm a surfin' surgeon, but I still floss three times a day and pay my installments four times a year. 
 So, what's 
 my 
 dental floss? 
 Fire and brimstone. 
 Mmm. 
 Actually, that is from the New Testament. 
 I don't even know what brimstone is. 
 I meant you fear disaster. 
 Your people's history is kind of filled with it. 
 Billy has cancer. 
 How are your first-years doing? 
 Jordan talks too much, and Olivia talks too little. 
 And Olivia does not know where the jugular vein is. 
 You see her resume? 
 Her grades and USMLE scores were nearly perfect. 
 So, if it's not a lack of knowledge, what do you think it is? 
 I think Olivia has the potential to be an exemplary doctor if you push her, give her a little extra attention. 
 Isn't that unfair to Jordan? 
 Was it unfair to the applicant who didn't get 
 your 
 position because Dr. Glassman thought that you needed some extra attention? 
 Olivia just doesn't like being in the spotlight. 
 That's all. 
 Olivia's resume didn't say anything about not liking the spotlight. 
 Exactly. 
 Don't trust resumes.

 I got a great mechanic for you. 
 If you tell her Billy sent you, she'll give you a friends-and-family. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Okay. 
 Thanks for that. 
 You have an amazing attitude. 
 You know, my wife used to tease me about that. 
 She died three years ago. 
 I'm sorry.

 You know, on our second date, I got a flat.

 We are through the uterine wall. 
 Dr. Jackson, what's our next step? 
 Advance through the trocar millimeters beyond the tip until the opening of the distal basket can be confirmed by ultrasound. 
 Exactly. 
 What would you like me to advance, Dr. Jackson? 
 Oh. 
 Yes. 
 Right. 
 OLIVIA: Obviously, you would be advancing the double basket rocket catheter, not this. 
 Sorry. 
 Not your fault. 
 If a junior resident is ill-prepared, that's on the senior resident. 
 How is it fair that I get blamed for a first-year's mistake, and how can I help that person without being unfair to the other one? 
 And how fair was the preferential treatment that you gave me? 
 And how fair was it to the other first-year resident, who didn't get placed because you helped me? 
 - And how fair was... 
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Put the list down. 
 Only four questions at a time. 
 That's my limit. 
 What kind of mistake? 
 Even though I went over the procedure with Olivia, she still gave Dr. Andrews the pusher rod when he needed the rocket catheter, and he said it was 
 my 
 fault. 
 It 
 was 
 your fault. 
 You got to help her a little more. 
 That is not fair to Jordan. 
 What does fairness have to do with it? 
 It's not about equality. 
 It's about figuring out what each person needs and then teaching them how to get it. 
 How do I know what they need? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, you've taught them medicine, right? 
 So, uh, maybe it's something else. 
 Maybe it's an emotional issue. 
 Well, then I definitely can't give them what they need. 
 You can ask them. 
 About their emotions? 
 Yeah, ask them how they feel. 
 I don't care how they feel. 
 That's the beauty of it. 
 You don't have to care. 
 You just have to ask them how they really feel. 
 Then they start talking.

 He's in anaphylactic shock.

 We should intubate. Initiate CPR. 
 You should cannulate his femoral vein 
 to give pressers and volume. 
 Let's intubate 
 and 
 cannulate. 
 His jugular's distended. 
 Maybe he has cardiac tamponade from a pericardial effusion. 
 He might need open-heart surgery.

 Once our feelings change, everything changes.

 Really okay? 
 You want to know why I'm so nervous all the time?

 Yeah, I can still hear them laughing at me. 
 And two nights ago, I dreamt I was standing in front of Mrs. Deloitte's class again. 
 Couldn't wait to wake up. 
 But when I did, I realized that if I got the answer wrong today, no one will laugh, but someone may die. 
 The kids laughed at me, too. 
 Even though I knew   times   was   . 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 One of the amniotic sacs ruptured. 
 The strong twin's. 
 It's metastasized to his liver. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. 
 Short recovery time, but a significant chance his cancer returns. 
 Care to rebut? 
 I think we should consider a hepatic lobectomy and lymph node dissection. 
 Remove the affected area of the liver, all the surrounding tissue, and every swollen node we find. 
 And that's the aggressive approach. 
 Longer recovery time, high risk of complications, and, uh, admittedly, the best shot at beating the cancer. 
 By ""complications,"" you mean a barely functioning liver, a persistent threat of fatal bleeds, and chronic pain. 
 As surgeons, you can gut him, but as his primary doctor, I have to find the balance between longevity and quality of life. 
 CLAIRE: Last week, you were trying to perform surgery from the gallery, and now you hate surgeons.

 Every time we try to solve a problem, we discover another one. 
 You may have left your religion in Brooklyn, but you keep looking for meaning in random events. 
 The dice have no memory. 
 ASHER: I'm not looking for meaning. 
 I'm looking for patterns. 
 Maybe he's got some underlying condition. 
 I agree with Asher. 
 The dice have no memory, but they can be loaded. 
 So... safe and seriously compromised or aggressive and possibly dead? 
 Your case, Dr. Browne. 
 Your call. 
 How you feeling? 
 You sacrificed a lot. 
 Your hands, your career. 
 And you're taking it out on me and Claire and the whole surgical profession. 
 I get it. 
 It hurts. 
 You're pathetic. 
 You're worried about me because I'll never be a surgeon? 
 Boo-hoo. 
 You're worried about me because I took pleasure in screwing with you and Claire? 
 That's who I am. 
 The question is, who are 
 you? 
 You don't show up late with lame-ass excuses, and when you get dissed, you diss back, so... 
 How are 
 you 
 feeling? 
 Forget I asked. 
 He's lost most of his amniotic fluid. 
 Won't last very long in utero. 
 In helping the weak, we hurt the strong. 
 C-section? 
 If we do a C-section to save the strong baby, there's a   % chance the weak baby will die. 
 But if we do an amnioinfusion to save the weak baby, there's an   % chance that strong baby will die. 
 It's the better option. 
 % to decide which baby lives? 
 Kenzie's body has already made that choice. 
 If there's a strong baby and a weak baby, it's pretty clear which one we save. 
 Survival of the fittest. 
 Sorry. 
 It's just... 
 That's not really what we're about, is it, as a civilization? 
 Aren't the strong morally obligated to help the weak? 
 And if they don't, isn't everybody ultimately worse off? 
 Neither baby has to die. 
 Delayed interval delivery. 
 We induce labor, deliver the strong twin, then stop the labor to keep the weak twin in utero until his lungs mature. 
 The chances of stopping labor are very slim. 
 That's true. 
 There's about a   % chance that both babies would die. 
 Which makes it the worst possible choice. 
 - We need to ask Kenzie. 
 - No, we don't. 
 Once she hears there's the slightest chance of saving both babies, she won't listen to any alternatives. 
 Statistically, it's a terrible option. 
 But it 
 is an option. 
 No. 
 No, you can't seriously be asking me this. 
 I know that this is something no mother should ever have to decide. 
 There are no good options here, but there is one that'll most likely make you the mother of a healthy baby boy. 
 Okay. 
 Prep for an amnioinfusion... 
 Have you named them?

 I believe she made the right choice. 
 She made a choice any mother would make because the alternative is unthinkable. 
 Isn't that exactly what made it the right choice? 
 She has to live with it.

 Uh, just checking in with you, Livy.

 You wanted hands off. 
 You're getting hands off. 
 But I can still say hi to my niece.

 It looks like you're settling in pretty well. 
 No, the way you spoke up yesterday... 
 I mean, that's a tough case, tough crowd, but you held your own. 
 I'm getting there. 
 Dr. Murphy's been very supportive. 
 Murphy? 
 Yeah, I'm glad to hear it. 
 I'm sure he sees your potential. 
 - But if you need anything, you... 
 - Mmm. 
 ...ask anyone but me. 
 Very hands off. 
 Hmm. 
 Shaun, this is not an argument I ever thought I'd have to have with a boyfriend, whether moving in together matters. 
 It so obviously does. 
 It so obviously changes everything. 
 But one of the reasons I'm in this relationship 
 (SIGHS) 
 Is because of that. 
 You 
 are 
 different. 
 And when I think about us, say, a year from now, I can't imagine us 
 not 
 living together. 
 So, if it's inevitable... 
 Shaun, I am moving in with you. 
 Does that mean you think we have enough commitment and trust? 
 Honestly... 
 I'm not sure. 
 So, you want to do it just because it's inevitable? 
 Mmm. 
 That makes it sound terrible. 
 But that 
 is kind of how I feel, 
 so, yeah. 
 You're moving back in!

 Kenzie's only two centimeters dilated, and even though I'm not a surgeon, I have other important things to do. 
 You were wrong.

 They're a lot of work. 
 But I fixed Olivia. 
 Wonderful.

 No.

 Except, it's messing with my games.

 Not until yesterday. 
 And we didn't wanna deal with a formal custody arrangement for Kellan, but now that he's   , it's official. 
 I know it's been over for years, but when it's really over, it hurts. 
 And I'm pissed at myself for being hurt, and, uh, now I'm pissed at myself for admitting that to the coldest person I know.

 I will help you prep and debrief afterwards. 
 But this patient doesn't need a gallery of strangers standing around, gawking at her most private experience. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 Ben woke up complaining of pain. 
 Did you check the incision? 
 The pain is in his arm. 
 Now test external rotation of the shoulder. 
 (WINCES) 
 - We're almost done. 
 - (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 Can you describe the pain? 
 Aah! (WINCES) 
 We'll call it a   . 
 It's been hurting for years, but, aah, this is... 
 This is something else. 
 How did you injure your shoulder before? 
 I was in a... (SIGHS) 
 I was in a convoy in Kandahar, and there was a... 
 (BREATH TREMBLING) 
 (STAMMERS) I dislocated my... 
 You don't need to discuss it with us. 
 What did you find? 
 Swelling, sensitivity to touch, discoloration. 
 - Could be CRPS. 
 - What is that? 
 Well, it appears the car accident aggravated a prior injury. 
 You've developed complex regional pain syndrome. 
 We'll start you on Gabapentin and Dilaudid. 
 Opioids make me a little insane. 
 We could do a stellate ganglion block. 
 It's an injection of anesthetic near the spine that blocks the pain signals, and could also help the PTSD. 
 I've been treated for PTSD for years. 
 Why haven't I heard about this? 
 It's experimental, but promising. 
 The procedure comes with risks: 
 Vascular injury, infection, major hematoma. 
 Dr. Lim, I've been taking a risk every time I go to sleep. 
 I want to do it. 
 Stellate block is an accepted procedure for treatment of pain. 
 Which you wouldn't have suggested if the patient didn't also have a mental health condition. 
 (SHOES SQUEAK) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) I hear Jordan's back on the D&C, in spite of her righteous indignation. 
 Is something chirping? 
 I think you're being unfair. 
 Well, if anyone's being unfair, it's me. 
 I told Jordan to do it. 
 I told her. 
 We make decisions that are hard to live with all the time. 
 We make them anyway. 
 And I told her pissing off the Chief was a very bad way to start your residency. 
 Glad to hear you're still moonlighting as surgical department camp counselor, but I don't mean you were being unfair to Jordan. 
 You're being unfair to the patient. 
 She's facing an emotionally fraught procedure. 
 She needs the support of her doctors. 
 And who she's getting is a rookie who thinks she's committing m*rder. 
 And Shaun. 
 I have a point. 
 I'll lead Jordan through the D&C myself. 
 You're happy. 
 Dr. Murphy will be happy. 
 My cup runneth over. 
 Now get whatever's in that box out of my department. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (RETCHING) 
 Morning sickness. 
 Nurse Ella's. 
 Rose claims she can feel her pregnancy. 
 She was right about the guy in Room    . 
 He had a clot in his ankle. 
 I'm sure she picked up on some subtle clues, like the guy moaning and grasping his ankle. 
 Get a CT to rule out abdominal injury from her fall. 
 DR. LIM: We're going to insert a thin needle into your neck so we can inject the anesthetic. 
 It may sting a bit. 
 Use an in-plane approach to place the needle between the C  tubercle and carotid artery. 
 CLAIRE: You might feel some discomfort. 
 (LIQUID POURING)

 (CELLPHONE CHIMES) 
 DR. LIM: What's wrong? 
 Zoe's hurt. 
 I'm okay. 
 Get some ice. 
 Let me take a look. 
 What happened? 
 I hit her. 
 ZOE: I was laying next to him. 
 I know I shouldn't, but the shot just made his pain feel so much better. 
 - I thought... 
 - Zo. 
 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 There was a noise in the hall. 
 - I lashed out. 
 - I know. 
 I didn't mean to. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Nothing's broken. 
 I can get you something for the swelling. 
 No. I'm okay. I'm gonna go home, get cleaned up. 
 I just need some time. 
 I love you. 
 I think we can help Ben. 
 There have been some promising results using Vagal Nerve Stimulation to treat PTSD. 
 DR. LIM: His scarring would make it impossible to expose and find the nerve without damaging it. 
 Those scars are the reason that we need to try. 
 Imagine reliving your worst nightmare over and over again. 
 (SCOFFS) Why doesn't anyone around here want to do the job they were hired for? 
 What Ben needs is psychological help. 
 I've ordered a consult. 
 Leave it to the people who are trained to do it. 
 It sets a bad precedent to force a resident to do a procedure they're not comfortable with. 
 Wow. Does anyone around here not have an opinion about who should do that damn abortion? 
 Jordan had a choice, and in my opinion, she made the right one. 
 It's not a true choice if you're coerced by your boss. 
 I asked her to do her job. 
 You took an opportunity from a resident who wants to learn in favor of one who doesn't. 
 Is this song and dance about Jordan doing the procedure or your niece not doing it? 
 Neither. 
 There's a misconception that Olivia came to St. Bonaventure because of me. 
 She's here because of your reputation. 
 The great Dr. Lim, a master class in technique, professionalism, empathy. 
 Lately, it doesn't seem like that reputation holds up. 
 JORDAN: I'm giving you an antibiotic to prevent infection. 
 The vacuum aspiration will take about    minutes, and you'll be numbed with a local anesthetic. 
 Conscious sedation is also an option, but you will need someone to drive you home afterwards. 
 Do you have any questions for me? 
 I'm scared. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 Are you certain you wanna go ahead with the abortion? 
 Yes. 
 Then you don't have to be scared. 
 You're the making the right decision for you. 
 Give her another     micrograms of misoprostol. 
 I'll be back for the procedure. 
 This doesn't work. 
 I need these numbers in spreadsheet format. 
 - Thank you. 
 - DR. PARK: Oh, excuse me. 
 Dr. Park? 
 Rose's CT was normal. 
 Get an upper GI barium study. 
 First quarter supply costs you requested. 
 Also, one of your first-years seems upset. 
 He's been in the stairwell for a while. 
 DR. LIM: Everything okay in here? 
 I just needed some quiet. 
 Surgeons come into the stairwell for two reasons, fire drills or doctor trauma. 
 You having a fire drill? 
 I just wish we had a more effective treatment for Ben. 
 His head's so messed up, and we can't help him. 
 I don't think this is about Ben. 
 Have you ever lost a patient you knew you could have saved? 
 When COVID was at its worst, we had to cancel all non-urgent procedures. 
 A young mom with a heart condition was more urgent than I thought. 
 And she died waiting for me to put her on the schedule. 
 How do you get past that? 
 You get past it because that's the job. 
 You will always remember it. 
 And you will eventually stop reliving it. 
 How can you be so sure? 
 Because if you don't, you can't be a surgeon. 
 And I'm pretty sure you're a surgeon. 
 I should get back to work. 
 Insert the speculum. 
 Now dilate the cervix. 
 Begin suction. 
 Begin gentle suction in the uterus. 
 Is anything wrong? 
 You're okay. 
 Dr. Allen, I can take it from here. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Don't worry. We're almost done. 
 You're gonna be just fine. 
 You have no idea what that woman was going through, and you made it worse for her. 
 I know. I didn't... 
 You had an opportunity to opt out before you walked into that room, but you agreed to do the procedure, you took on an obligation to that patient, and you failed her. 
 If you ever do anything like that again, 
 I will have you removed from my program. 
 Maybe you should be cleaning bedpans for a while. 
 Hopefully there's no moral objection to that. 
 Why are there adult toys on my desk? 
 I've heard good things about the Llama, but online reviews aren't always accurate. 
 Do you have a favorite? 
 They're for Lea. 
 Which one do you like the most, Claire? 
 Uh... 
 Uh... 
 Evidence suggests that trauma changes the way the brain works. 
 An over active amygdala can heighten someone's response to emotional stimuli, including fear. 
 I think we should consider amygdala ablation for Ben. 
 That's crazy. 
 And completely outside the scope of our care. 
 - We're s... 
 - (ADULT TOY VIBRATING) 
 Oh. 
 (VIBRATING STOPS) 
 We're surgeons. 
 We fix physiological problems, not mental ones. 
 It is a physiological problem. 
 His brain isn't functioning properly. 
 If it was a tumor that was causing these reactions, you wouldn't hesitate to remove it. 
 But there is no tumor. 
 You're talking about inflicting damage on his brain. 
 He could suffer a stroke or come out in a coma or not come out at all. 
 SHAUN: If you use a stereotactic laser approach rather than an open craniotomy, you would greatly reduce the risks. 
 This is not your case! 
 You cannot jump into this one because you don't want to do the one assigned to you, which is to teach, which you've made my problem just like you made Lea's birthday gifts my problem. 
 You need to grow up and accept some responsibility. 
 I was diagnosed with PTSD last year. 
 I kept it mainly private. 
 Melendez really helped me through it. 
 It was nice to have a friend to lean on. 
 So if you need one... 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 I feel off. 
 Disconnected. 
 Like I can't catch my breath. 
 But it comes with the job. 
 I'll get over it. 
 (CELLPHONES CHIME, VIBRATE) 
 It's Ben. 
 Ben. 
 No one is gonna hurt you. 
 You're having a flashback. 
 I know where I am. 
 Every day since I came home, I've felt like there's a monster chasing me. 
 I try to outrun it but I end up hurting the one I love the most. 
 I'm a threat to everyone around me. 
 No, Ben, you just need help. 
 Nothing helps. 
 I can't smile. I can't laugh. 
 I can't feel anything but pain. 
 I make everyone around me suffer. 
 Ben. 
 There's a surgery that may help. 
 I would like to scrub in on the amygdala ablation surgery. 
 Rose said you're feeling overwhelmed and need... 
 I don't wanna hear any more things that woman has said. 
 Your job is to supervise your residents. 
 Why are you here instead of doing that? 
 You said you were going to supervise my supervision, but you didn't. You took over my case. 
 I don't know what I was supposed to learn or how. 
 Scrub in. 
 (WHIRRING) 
 Dr. Murphy, walk Asher through the probe placement and trajectory to the amygdala. 
 I will supervise your supervision. 
 Okay, insert the probe perpendicular to the cortical surface. 
 Stop! You're off course. 
 On the current trajectory, you will penetrate a branch of the choroidal artery and cause a hemorrhage. 
 Step away from the probe. 
 Your job is to teach, not take over. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Adjust the probe one millimeter inferiorly. 
 Avoid the temporal horn on your right. 
 I can't see it on the image guidance. 
 Tell Asher what you see. 
 It should point toward your six o'clock on the Y axis. 
 You have to feel it. 
 The... 
 The tissue plane along the parenchyma is smooth. 
 It should feel like gliding. 
 You've reached the amygdala. 
 CLAIRE: Ready to begin thermal laser ablation. 
 DR. PARK: (MUMBLING) Rose's upper GI and labs were normal. 
 Should we keep her another day to observe? 
 No. If she's stable, let's send her home. 
 - Okay, I'll have Olivia... 
 - Open your mouth. 
 Pardon me? 
 Open your mouth. 
 - I can, uh... 
 - Shut your mouth. 
 - DR. PARK: There's this rat. 
 - A mouse. 
 A little dead mouse in the garage, and the big, strong man is afraid to get it out. 
 Not afraid, disgusted. 
 Neither of us wanna deal with it, so we are settling it in the only responsible way, a bet. 
 A dare. A series of dares, actually. 
 Whoever wusses out first has to... 
 Take those things out of your mouth. 
 I will discharge Rose. 
 You two, go home. 
 - We were just... 
 - Being idiots at work, while people are sick and dying. 
 Go home. 
 All your tests are normal. 
 We're discharging you. 
 Right, because you're psychic. 
 I'm an empath, not a psychic. 
 Whatever the case, I would suggest you take it easy. 
 No drinking, no heavy lifting... 
 You have to let it out, dear. 
 It was you. 
 You made my heart rate spike. 
 You're about to implode. 
 There's nothing wrong with you... or me.

 I let you down. I let the patient down. 
 I am deeply sorry. 
 And I promise it will not happen again. 
 You let your personal judgment get in the way of doing your job. 
 You're right. That is inexcusable. 
 (SIGHS) 
 You said I had no idea what the patient was going through. 
 The truth is I kinda do. 
 Scared, alone, afraid of anyone finding out. 
 I chose my career over motherhood, over my faith. 
 But I don't regret it. 
 And I know God forgave me because I get to be here, living my dream of being a doctor. 
 But I purposely try not to think about it. 
 You're off scut duty. 
 That's not why I... 
 Take it.

 My name is Benjamin Alan Harris. 
 I'm in St. Bonaventure Hospital in San Jose. 
 Language and memory appear to be intact, and your motor function is normal. 
 But that doesn't mean it worked, does it? 
 No. 
 We'll have to do an fMRI to see how you respond to fear-inducing stimuli. 
 But we'll let you rest for now. 
 I'm not gonna rest until I know I'm better. 
 I want you to know how I got these scars. 
 No. Not now. 
 Just give yourself time. 
 I was in a convoy in Kandahar. 
 I was in a Husky, the big vehicle at the front. 
 Ben, you don't have to do this. 
 Ronnie was driving. 
 He was telling me a story, something about a goat at the base, or maybe it was a chicken. I don't know. But... 
 We were laughing. 
 Then the world was on fire. 
 It's the Husky's job to spot IEDs.

 ROSE: I thought I felt someone here. 
 You've had a long day. 
 You have Prinzmetal's Angina, Rose. 
 A heart condition. 
 But it's very treatable. 
 It explains all your symptoms, and it's exacerbated by stress, which is likely what caused your heart attack. 
 You need to stop seeking out other people's pain. 
 It's literally k*lling you. 
 You're the Chief of Surgery. 
 You could have sent somebody else to tell me this. 
 Sure. 
 But then I'd miss my chance to gloat. 
 You're here because you're hurting and you don't know where else to go. 
 Go ahead. Use your magic. 
 Tell me what's wrong with me. 
 How do I stop feeling like this? 
 It doesn't work that way. 
 I don't have a magic wand. 
 I can only hold up a mirror, make you slow down, look at the parts of yourself that you've been trying to ignore because you're afraid if you look too closely, you'll break. 
 Maybe you will. I don't know. 
 Maybe breaking is the point.

 at a fundraiser hosted by my parents. 
 His wife collapsed

 Nutmeg allergy. 
 I gave her an epi and helped 
 her to outbid John Legend 
 for a weekend at an underwater hotel. 
 - Well...

 Roland hired me that night. 
 Why does he need a personal physician? 
 Does he often get att*cked 
 by wild animals? 
 Uh, chronic sciatica. 
 And he travels a lot, you know, 
 so there's vaccines, 
 plus BOTOX injections, 
 cholesterol scripts, 
 medical advice for friends and family. 
 Why'd you leave St. Bon's? 
 He was fired for assaulting an 
 attending who harassed Claire, 
 and then he sued the hospital. 
 - You're that guy. 
 - Yeah. 
 I hear Andrews is, uh, 
 not your biggest fan. 
 Surprised he let me in the building. 
 Depressed and dislocated sternum, 
 manubrium, and rib fractures.

 Saving the baby may be her priority. 
 But saving her is ours. 
 Sonja is our patient. 
 We should explain her options 
 but recommend termination. 
 Morgan is right, 
 but be clear about the options. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 The seat springs allow the car seat 
 to move more than one inch, 
 which creates additional injury risk. 
 There are no over-shoulder seat 
 belts in the back for the car seat, 
 no crumple zone, and you 
 would have to install a roll cage, 
 which still would not be as 
 reliable as one built into the vehicle. 
 Since you hate minivans, 
 I have looked into hatchbacks and 
 SUVs with sufficient safety features. 
 It's not just about hating minivans. 
 - What is it about? 
 - I love this car. 
 It's my history. 
 My brother and I restored it, 
 used to drive it to shows 
 at The Fillmore. 
 You and I took it on our 
 first road trip. I can't sell it. 
 Then... we do not have to. 
 As long as you never put 
 the Peanut in it. 
 We still need a family car. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
 Roland's awake. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 But it's possible that 
 we could save our baby? 
 You'd have to live here. 
 We'd monitor you every day 
 and give you prophylactic 
 antibiotics and steroids 
 when the baby gets closer to viability. 
 [DR. REZNICK] To be clear, 
 even with all of that, 
 you may still develop 
 a serious uterine infection 
 that could require a hysterectomy 
 or cause fatal complications. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I think we should terminate. 
 What would you do... 
 if it was your baby? 
 Termination is the safest. 
 I was talking to Dr. Allen. 
 I would... 
 pray on it. 
 And then? 
 I want to know what you would do. 
 [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [EXHALES SOFTLY] 
 I think I... 
 would try to save the baby. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 We have to fight for our Esther. 
 [PEREZ] We'd need a biopsy 
 before we can give you 
 any definitive answer. 
 Okay. 
 So, when do we do that? 
 I'll give you a detailed referral 
 to take to another doctor. 
 If I wanted to go to another doctor, 
 I would have. 
 I don't have to keep treating you. 
 But you will. 
 You're not a quitter. 
 You worked your ass off 
 to save your marriage. 
 You never tapped out in a fight. You... 
 I always admired your persistence. 
 I kinda hated it, too. 
 [WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Looking back at my life... 
 I don't like the view. 
 I hurt... a lot of people. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 That's the real reason that I came here. 
 For forgiveness. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 The intra-aortic balloon pump worked. 
 You won't need a new heart. 
 Great. 
 So, when can I get out of here? 
 Oh, not for a few days. 
 We will need to monitor you 
 for post-surgical complications. 
 Your heart rate is elevated. 
 Have you been exerting yourself? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 She did most of the exerting. 
 - [MONITOR ALARM] 
 - Okay. 
 I need , milligrams levetiracetam 
 and  milligrams lorazepam, stat! 
 Is Rolly gonna be okay? 
 [KNOCK ON GLASS] 
 Roland had a seizure. 
 You... should sit down. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Dalia was there. 
 Naked. 
 They were having sex. 
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 Dalia and I aren't together. 
 She's with Roland. 
 It's part of the gig. 
 I pretend she's with me so Roland's wife 
 doesn't get suspicious 
 that Dalia's always around. 
 Oh. 
 You think that sex 
 brought on the seizure? 
 Oh. Arousal can increase 
 the heart rate by %, 
 and if his brain 
 was also deprived of oxygen, 
 it could cause a seizure, 
 which would mean his heart 
 is still not pumping enough blood. 
 Does it bother you to have 
 to lie on a regular basis? 
 It's not my favorite responsibility, 
 but it's a great job, so... 
 Why is it a great job? 
 On my last day, Shaun, you told 
 me that one day I will be very happy. 
 But I was miserable. 
 I felt like a failure. 
 And then I met Roland, 
 and he saw something in me, 
 this guy that I really admired, 
 that the world admired. 
 You know, he... he valued me. 
 And I certainly don't mind 
 flying private to Amsterdam 
 to have rijsttafel with 
 the Queen of the Netherlands. 
 I also said you would 
 fulfill your potential. 
 And I'm not doing that? 
 No. 
 Sciatica? 
 Thanks for reminding me 
 I'm still a failure. 
 I'll get the BNP test and echo 
 and check out his heart. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. PARK] Inject saline 
 to get us to submucosal plane. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Why'd you stay on the case? 
 There's the tumor. 
 He was right. 
 I take my obligations seriously. 
 Take four samples. 
 Not because some part of you 
 wants to forgive him? 
 Withdraw the scope slowly. 
 - He doesn't deserve it. 
 - [GLOVES SNAP] 
 Let's start with a sofa. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Let's take a look. 
 Finally, somebody recognizes 
 my interior design genius. 
 Looks nice. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Hey, I love this. I'll take it. 
 No. 
 This is literally 
 the first thing you've sat on. 
 Okay, I'll sit in ten other ones, 
 and then I'll take this one. 
 No. If you know you like something, 
 stick with it. 
 Like my car. 
 Shaun wants to buy a minivan. 
 And what, you want to put 
 your infant in a ' Gran Torino? 
 No. It's not safe for a baby. 
 But... 
 [SIGHS] it is... 
 cool. 
 Even when I am going 
 to my super grown-up job 
 in my lady-boss pantsuit, 
 I get to get out of that car, 
 and I'm cool. 
 And soon, I will be 
 just another -something mom 
 in a practical car 
 with a baby seat in the back 
 and spit-up on my shirt. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Maddie's mom used to warn me 
 to take two shirts 
 whenever I went out with the baby. 
 - I had to learn the hard way. 
 - How? 
 H-How do I want this baby so badly, 
 but feel so icked out by being a mom? 
 Define ""icked out."" 
 Like... 
 mnh. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - I don't know. 
 Okay, that's well said. 
 [LAUGHS] I don't know. 
 Hey, you got mixed emotions. 
 Welcome to the human condition. 
 I'm gonna take this one. 
 Her fever's hiked. 
 She's in a lot of pain. 
 Her heart rate's . Fetal heart 
 rate . They're both tachycardic. 
 milligrams acetaminophen 
 and start ampicillin. 
 This is the infection 
 we were worried about. 
 Your baby is very unlikely to survive, 
 and your life is in danger. 
 We need to terminate now. 
 But her heart's still beating. 
 Esther can only stay alive in utero, 
 and as long as she's in there, 
 you'll keep getting sicker. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm here. We can get through this. 
 We can try again. 
 [SNIFFLES] No. 
 Your baby needs at least 
 two more weeks to be viable, 
 and if we wait that long, 
 you will probably die. 
 ""If I perish, I perish."" 
 That's what Queen Esther said 
 before she risked her life 
 to save her family. 
 Sonja. 
 ""If I perish... 
 I perish."" 
 [DR. ANDREWS] According to 
 your BNP test and echo, 
 your seizure was not related 
 to heart trauma. 
 The EEG will let us assess your brain. 
 So, what's your pitch? 
 Hospital presidents 
 don't supervise EEGs. 
 I've been very impressed 
 by your Global Engineers Initiative, 
 and I think we can do 
 the same thing with medicine, 
 train doctors from the developing world 
 to take care of their own people. 
 What makes St. Bon's the place to do it? 
 We're very hands-on here. 
 Our residents don't just 
 do appies and lap choles. 
 With the guidance of our attendings, 
 they come up with 
 complex treatment solutions, 
 untangle the thorniest ethical dilemmas, 
 and learn how to provide 
 top-notch patient care. 
 If we could sponsor more residents 
 from the developing world, 
 we'll send them home ready 
 to serve their communities. 
 But Jared, who I trust with my life, 
 wasn't good enough to be 
 one of those residents. 
 You fired him. 
 You saw something in him I missed. 
 - Mm. 
 - But I'm seeing it now, 
 and I've granted him full access. 
 That's a very politic answer. 
 What do you think, Jared? 
 Has he earned my money? 
 I learned a tremendous amount 
 here at St. Bon's, 
 and as you've experienced, 
 the care is top-notch. 
 Mm, unfortunately, the food isn't. 
 Oh, text Dalia and ask her to 
 bring us back some of those, um, 
 pork buns from Yank Sing. Ohh. 
 Dalia went into the city? 
 Mm-hmm, to meet up with friends. 
 And you're okay with that? 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 No reason. 
 Uh, all right. 
 Let's start this. 
 Close your eyes and relax. 
 Labs confirm Sonja has chorioamnionitis. 
 We should add gentamicin. 
 That would damage the baby's kidneys. 
 It's our only way to keep Sonja alive, 
 and it buys us time 
 to convince her to terminate. 
 She's being suicidal. 
 Risking your life for your child 
 is usually considered admirable. 
 Not if you're both going to die... 
 because of the false hope you gave her. 
 I answered a patient's question. 
 You gave her permission. 
 We're supposed to at least 
 try to be objective. 
 Objectivity is a myth, 
 especially on this subject. 
 I know the pain Sonja's grappling with. 
 So do I. 
 I was in med school, on birth control, 
 and I got pregnant anyway. 
 I wasn't ready for a kid. 
 I was scared... 
 and sad... 
 and relieved. 
 It was medical procedure 
 I had years ago, 
 and I'm at peace with it now. 
 Most women are. 
 Because it was their choice. 
 A choice you got to make, 
 and I did, too. 
 Let Sonja make hers. 
 It's not our job 
 to help patients choose death. 
 [CELL PHONES CHIME] 
 Her lungs are failing. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - Her O sets are falling. 
 - Fever's climbing. 
 Intubation cart. 
 Administer propofol and rocuronium. 
 Hey, we need to sedate you 
 so we can intubate. 
 That'll keep you breathing, 
 but the only way to... 
 No. You can't k*ll her. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 Esther's life before mine. 
 - Sonja, please. 
 - Promise me. 
 - I can't. 
 - Promise me. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Anthony. 
 I p... 
 I promise. 
 I love you. 
 Shaun, check out the activity 
 in the left frontal lobe 
 from Roland's EEG. 
 Interictal spikes. 
 They are very small, likely incidental. 
 Hmm. 
 Roland's selfish and possessive. 
 He hates it when people 
 have fun without him, 
 but today he was totally fine with Dalia 
 hanging out with friends 
 while he's stuck here. 
 Being unselfish is a symptom. 
 Maybe one of his wounds got infected. 
 Bacterial encephalitis 
 from the claws or teeth. 
 This could be subtle edema. 
 Plus behavioral changes 
 and interictal spikes. 
 That sounds like neurocysticercosis. 
 - A tapeworm cyst. 
 - With larva in the brain. 
 But it would take a tapeworm weeks 
 to fully form larva 
 and a cyst in his brain. 
 The attack was two days ago. 
 Ooh. 
 Roland's last local safari 
 was about two months ago, 
 and he fell into 
 a giant pile of tiger crap. 
 We can remove the cyst and larva 
 with stereotactic navigation 
 and hydrodissection. 
 - Awesome. 
 - Oh! 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You're not a failure. 
 Seriously? Four guesses? 
 I got it in two. 
 What's up with you? 
 You lose a patient? 
 Actually, I might save one. 
 Joe. 
 Mia's Joe? 
 Waiting on his biopsy results. 
 He asked me to forgive him. 
 What did you say? 
 I refused. 
 You would have, too. 
 Hmm, well, maybe. 
 Then again, I am capable 
 of letting things go. 
 I can let things go. 
 I prioritized my career for a day, 
 which you decided was unacceptable, 
 even after I changed my mind. 
 And how long did it take you 
 to forgive Mia? 
 Dr. Park. 
 Your diagnosis is in. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [CLATTERING] 
 [DR. GLASSMAN, MUFFLED] 
 Right this way, guys. 
 Be careful. You've got history 
 you're carrying right there. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 There's a couple of steps. Be careful. 
 Thanks, guys. First door on the right. 
 Stadium seats? 
 Authentic Candlestick Park 
 stadium seats. 
 Got them from a broker. 
 - Very cool. 
 - Right? 
 - Thank you for the inspiration. 
 - You're welcome. 
 Your turn next. Get your coat. 
 You have a stromal tumor in your stomach 
 and a small lesion on your liver. 
 And we can remove both. 
 [PEREZ] You'll be cancer-free. 
 Hmm. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 T-That's incredible. 
 Thank you. 
 You get it, right? 
 You're not dying. 
 Yes. 
 This is amazing. 
 I'm so grateful. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 - But it... 
 - That's not why you came here. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Sonja will likely 
 be in multi-organ failure 
 within the next  hours. 
 And when that happens, 
 Esther will not survive. 
 But if we terminate now, 
 Sonja still can. 
 You can save your wife's life. 
 It's all up to you. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 He says... 
 He says he can't do it. 
 He needs to keep his promise.

 generous, uh, but... 
 You can't accept it. 
 You are not medically fit to be 
 making any major decisions

 I closed a huge deal last week 
 with Mr. Worm as my consigliere. 
 I feel pretty competent. 
 Well, I'd be happy to accept

 I turned off your sedation. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I'm gonna let go of your hands, 
 but you can't pull out the tube. 
 When I was , 
 I had an abortion. 
 That child would have been  now, 
 just starting middle school. 
 Every time I see a kid that age, 
 I think about who they would have become 
 or what kind of mom I would have been. 
 I believe God's forgiven me. 
 That's kinda His thing. 
 And I believe God picked you 
 for motherhood. 
 You are so strong, 
 so brave, 
 with such a deep capacity for love. 
 But your Esther isn't developed enough 
 to survive outside of the womb. 
 The infection will k*ll both of you. 
 I told you if I were you, 
 I would try to save the baby. 
 I prayed for a miracle. 
 And I don't know 
 why it didn't come today. 
 The only way for you to be 
 the mom God wants you to be... 
 is to let Esther go.

 Go. I got this. 
 There are two screws missing. 
 Dr. Glassman doesn't have brain cancer,

 Shaun just wanted to have 
 a bit of a discussion... 
 You forgot two screws 
 when you built the crib. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay, Shaun, slow down. 
 Let's all at least take a seat first. 
 We're gonna have a discussion 
 about a crib? 
 Your CSF DNA test showed 
 your brain cancer has not returned, 
 but there is clearly something 
 impacting your neurological function. 
 Shaun, the crib has like 
 different parts 
 and instructions without any words. 
 Just pictures with arrows going 
 in every possible direction. 
 Okay. Thankfully, I was there 
 to correct your mistake, 
 but that won't always 
 be possible in the O.R. 
 The O.R.? 
 Yes. 
 - I would like to do more tests. 
 - That's not gonna happen. 
 - That's not gonna happen. 
 - And... And Dr. Lim should be notified. 
 That's absolutely not gonna happen! 
 If your executive function 
 has deteriorated 
 - even a small percentage... 
 - Shaun, just one second. 
 Just stop for a second. 
 Two screws? 
 There's nothing wrong with my brain. 
 There's nothing wrong

 not that that concerns you. 
 You go to Lim, and you're

 And breakfast. 
 He's right. 
 It's okay. You were just trying... 
 I can't go to Dr. Lim

 Or maybe he was right. 
 It is just a crib, and he was in a rush. 
 Everyone forgets things.

 Both. 
 Well, any feedback you have,

 It's a former patient of yours,

 Eddie? 
 I haven't seen him in years.

 He'll need surgery to remove it.

 This is a unique case. 
 A small duodenal mass?

 Yeah, yeah, fair enough.

 you did not tell them 
 about my condition. 
 I did not. Very few residents get to see

 and I figured this would be an 
 important learning opportunity. 
 They definitely failed 
 the bedside manner part. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Eh, heartthrobs like me 
 and Brad Pitt are used to it. 
 Any deep pain or tenderness here? 
 A little. 
 How's business? 
 Oh, fantastic. Thank the Lord. 
 Eddie is an amazing carpenter. 
 He built Isabel and I 
 this stunning mahogany 
 live edge dining table. 
 I have no idea what that is, 
 but it sounds delightful. 
 Yeah. Not much good for guitar, 
 but I can still wield a power tool. 
 You'll need to use 
 a carotid pulse monitor 
 and upper thigh for BP. 
 Got it. 
 How painful are the growths? 
 I mean, that depends. 
 They're basically just huge warts, 
 so face, not much. 
 Hands, a little. 
 Feet, a lot. 
 I'm blessed. 
 The Lord knows that a pretty face 
 can only get a handyman in trouble. 
 Dr. Reznick gave us a really 
 good view with her ultrasound, 
 but I'd like an MRI and a 
 biopsy to better assess the lesion. 
 Ah, might as well get 
 my money's worth, huh? 
 It's good seeing you, Eddie. 
 The team doc's playing it safe. 
 It was a damn curveball. 
 Well, even a damn double-A curveball 
 comes in at, what,   ,   ? 
 It can still do some damage, 
 helmet or no. 
 Two weeks isn't a long time 
 to be in concussion protocol. 
 Okay, well, I-I didn't 
 have a concussion. 
 I mean, I barely even had 
 a headache, so... 
 Can I help you, Dr. Murphy? 
 I came to observe. Please continue. 
 Your ImPACT scores 
 are a bit worse than baseline. 
 Okay, that's one test. 
 I mean, I-I passed all the others, 
 but the doc still won't clear me. 
 It's not a bad idea 
 to play it safe, though. 
 It is your brain we're talking about. 
 I mean, you're an outfielder, 
 so you don't need one just now... 
 ...but you are gonna retire someday. 
 Look, if I don't get back 
 on the field ASAP, 
 I won't have a career to retire from. 
 I wouldn't have come to the best 
 brain doctor in town otherwise. 
 Alright. We'll take a look. 
 Do a neuro and get me an MRI. 
 An MRI? For a concussion? 
 Well, he's got some dilation 
 of his left pupil. 
 Probably not significant, 
 but if we're gonna override 
 the team doctor, 
 we better be sure, hmm? 
 - On it. 
 - The MRI is a good idea. 
 I did not notice the dilated pupil. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Not a problem since it's not your case. 
 But it is an interesting case, 
 even if I did not know that 
 when I came here. 
 Since I've cleared my schedule, 
 I would like to continue observing. 
 You cleared your schedule 
 of people with actual ailments? 
 Mmm. 
 Okay, fine. Observe all you want. 
 I will. 
 Both you and the case. 
 Oh, there's no bleeding 
 or hematoma in your groin, 
 which means you're doing fantastic. 
 Her color looks better. 
 Everything looks better. 
 I just got off the phone 
 with Eden's social worker. 
 She's having trouble 
 finding foster parents 
 who are willing to take 
 a newborn with Turner Syndrome. 
 Well, it's not that difficult. 
 Her long-term symptoms 
 might not even be that severe. 
 Still, Eden will always 
 need special care. 
 It'll take a minute for 
 the lidocaine to take effect. 
 You may feel some discomfort 
 when the scope goes down your throat. 
 Got it. 
 I assume you've discussed 
 surgical removal 
 of your EV growths with Dr. Andrews? 
 Yeah. No, he wanted to try, 
 but obviously, there's the risk 
 of nerve damage, 
 plus they would just grow back. 
 This is how I was meant to be. 
 Lord works in mysterious ways. 
 But surgeons don't. 
 The risk of nerve damage 
 is actually quite small, 
 and I'd imagine easier 
 to live with than the pain 
 and lack of mobility and... 
 Repulsiveness? 
 No, no. I-I was... 
 It's alright. 
 I know how I look. 
 I see the frightened kids, 
 people laughing, 
 staring. 
 I just try my best to keep 
 my eyes and arms open 
 to all of God's gifts. 
 Cannot imagine taking an 
 -mile-an-hour baseball to the dome. 
 Some guys in the majors throw over    . 
 Phew. 
 I don't see any edema 
 or evidence of a hematoma. 
 Neither do I. 
 The anisocoria's probably harmless. 
 Twenty percent of people actually 
 have one pupil larger than the other. 
 You play any sports? 
 I played football and baseball 
 in high school. Why? 
 I have a friend who runs a 
 sports program for at-risk teens. 
 I've been helping coaching 
 some indoor football, 
 I mean soccer. 
 She's always looking for help 
 from positive role models. 
 Yeah, I've... 
 I've never coached kids before. 
 Mainly just making sure they 
 have fun and stay off the streets. 
 And my friend's super cool. 
 She's cute, too. 
 Well, helping kids sounds great, 
 but I'm trying to get a year in recovery 
 before I start dating. 
 Damn, my bad. 
 Oh, it's no big deal. I just... 
 No, I mean the... The anisocoria. 
 Definitely not harmless. 
 Or a concussion. 
 You have multiple cerebral aneurysms, 
 which puts you in danger 
 of a brain hemorrhage. 
 So, what now? 
 Well, we're gonna map 
 the precise vessels involved, 
 take some pictures 
 of the inside of your brain. 
 It's called a... 
 Cerebral angiogram. 
 We'll feed a catheter into your brain 
 through an artery in your wrist. 
 You'll be sedated. It's harmless. 
 As soon as we get the results, 
 we'll map out a surgical plan. 
 B-Brain surgery? 
 Hey. Best brain doc in town, right? 
 It just keeps getting worse. 
 The tumor has significantly 
 damaged the bile duct. 
 Eddie's gonna need a surgical resection 
 or possibly a major GI reconstruction. 
 The poor guy. 
 As if one rare and devastating 
 disease wasn't enough. 
 Well, the surgery is manageable. 
 I've known Eddie for years. 
 He's always been the embodiment 
 of, ""What doesn't k*ll you 
 makes you stronger."" 
 Who needs strength 
 when you're cradled 
 in the Lord's loving arms? 
 Given his situation, 
 don't you think his, 
 ""I'm just thankful for all God's 
 gifts"" attitude's just a bit crazy? 
 I find the strength he draws 
 from his faith very inspiring. 
 Except that his faith has inspired him 
 to not do the only thing 
 that would actually help him. 
 Get an octreoscan to confirm 
 that his liver, pancreas, 
 and lymph nodes aren't involved. 
 On it. 
 - You should probably go and... 
 - Referee? 
 Assist. 
 The radiolabeled tracer 
 will light up any areas 
 infiltrated by the tumor. 
 Will I get spidey strength, too? 
 Can I get you flat 
 on your back for the scan? 
 That won't be too painful, will it? 
 No. Sure, I'll be alright. 
 Is there any family 
 you'd like to contact? 
 No, it's just me. I live alone. 
 If you don't mind my asking, 
 E.V. is genetically inherited. 
 I'd assume at least one of 
 your parents suffered from it? 
 Yeah, they both did. 
 Did they both also decide 
 against surgical treatment? 
 Well, my parents were circus performers, 
 made a living off their appearance, 
 so I doubt they wanted any treatment. 
 Can't say that for sure, though. 
 They gave me up, 
 uh, right after I was born. 
 I'm sure they were trying to 
 protect you from the life they had. 
 Heh. No, from what I found out, 
 they thought a family act 
 would be too sad 
 and ruin the gig, 
 so they didn't want me around. 
 That's horrible. 
 Not at all. 
 I grew up in foster homes. 
 I had one mom who was a minister, 
 introduced me to the power of the Lord. 
 And then, when I was older, 
 I had a dad who was a carpenter. 
 Taught me everything I know. 
 I've always been blessed. 
 Advancing the catheter to 
 assess posterior circulation. 
 Dr. Murphy, do you mind if I ask, 
 qhy are you observing us? 
 I don't mind. 
 Why are you observing us? 
 I am not observing you. 
 I observing this case 
 because it is interesting. 
 Also, because it is Dr. Glassman's, 
 and he may display additional symptoms 
 that will help me diagnose 
 his deteriorating executive function. 
 So you're worried because he forgot 
 a couple of stitches on a routine close? 
 Stop. 
 The third aneurysm is low lying 
 at the basilar trunk. 
 That will be very difficult to clip. 
 And dangerous. 
 Definitely a very interesting case. 
 You sure you should be doing that? 
 Changing bandages or singing? 
 Both. 
 She's gonna be leaving soon. 
 I'll be fine. 
 No, I'm not overreacting. 
 He is covered in these tree-like 
 growths but refuses surgery. 
 But everyone acts 
 as if he's so inspiring. 
 It's a pretty brave choice. 
 No, it's a stupid choice. 
 Living in isolation 
 and unnecessary pain, 
 all because of his belief 
 in the Magical Mystery Tour 
 that is religion. 
 Well, given your family history, 
 I see why this patient is 
 a little triggering for you. 
 Okay, I'm not triggered. 
 This has nothing to do with my family. 
 Religion is the opiate of the masses. 
 You know, Marx got a lot wrong, 
 but not that one. 
 Why don't we talk about something else? 
 I mean, look at terrorism, 
 the countless wars, 
 the KKK, al-Qaeda, 
 bombed abortion clinics, 
 the as*ault on women's rights, 
 not to mention 
 the rampant persecution 
 of the LGBTQIA community. 
 I mean, you either have to have 
 your head in the sand 
 or be a complete moron not to see that. 
 Mmm. 
 This is done. Will you grab the salad? 
 Sorry. I was looking 
 for a place to meditate. 
 It's okay. 
 I came here to decompress 
 before I head home. 
 Jordan. 
 The other night at karaoke, 
 I shouldn't have tried to 
 give you relationship advice. 
 I mean, you don't need me for that... 
 or anything else, really. 
 You're everything. 
 Thanks. 
 Sorry, I gotta go. 
 He started vomiting blood 
 and then lost consciousness. 
 Get two units PRBC, stay two ahead, 
 - and place an NG tube. 
 - On it. 
 Eddie, can you hear me? Eddie? 
 The tumor's caused 
 a severe duodenal ulcer 
 and major hemorrhaging 
 in his upper GI tract. 
 Yeah. We can't excise it 
 if we can't stop the bleed. 
 We could do it in two steps, 
 endoscopy to stop the bleed 
 and a partial duodenectomy 
 to remove the tumor. 
 But it'd be safer to debulk 
 the tumor after the scope 
 and follow up with 
 aggressive chemotherapy. 
 Chemo would increase the pace 
 of the E.V. growths. 
 Which he doesn't seem bothered by. 
 Doesn't mean we should make it worse. 
 Well, it's better than 
 bleeding out in the OR. 
 He's not going to bleed out. 
 We can solve both the GI bleed 
 and totally excise the tumor 
 with a pancreaticoduodenectomy. 
 A Whipple while the patient 
 is hemorrhaging? 
 That's even more risky 
 than combining the scope and... 
 I'm aware of that, 
 but unlike your department chief, 
 I'm not interested in whether residents 
 approve of my decisions. 
 Get him prepped. 
 We'll approach all three aneurysms 
 from a left-sided craniotomy. 
 Even though the ICA aneurysm 
 is on the right side? 
 Yes. 
 We'll go after the basilar first, 
 as that is the most challenging. 
 What about the ipsilateral PCOM? 
 It's pressing the third nerve 
 and may rupture soon. 
 If you'd let me finish, 
 step two will be the PCOM, 
 and after that, 
 we'll cut across the infield 
 and go after the ICA. 
 Have you considered... 
 Shaun, will you stop? 
 Will you just please stop? 
 I'm fine. I know what I'm doing. 
 My memory is intact. 
 Does anyone have an actual objection 
 to the surgical plan? 
 - No. 
 - Nope. 
 Thank you. It is extensive 
 and could put Ricky at risk 
 for future seizures. 
 And your outburst could 
 indicate a lack of impulse control, 
 which is a symptom 
 of executive dysfunction. 
 I am exhibiting extraordinary 
 impulse control as we speak. 
 As to the risks, 
 I have clipped over  ,    aneurysms. 
 Tomorrow morning, 
 I'm going to clip three more. 
 Put Ricky on the schedule. 
 Go home. Get some sleep. 
 It's not milk and cookies, 
 but it'll have to do for now. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I was gonna take care of that. 
 Why? Did Park tell you to? 
 Dr. Park? No. I just got off my break, 
 - and I was going to... 
 - Great news. 
 I just got off the phone 
 with her social worker. 
 She found a foster family. 
 Lucky girl. You've got a home. 
 I know you were hoping 
 for a pancake dinner, 
 but I was thinking maybe we 
 could go to Barone's instead. 
 I'm really craving a meatball. 
 Yes, Dr. Glassman is not only 
 highly experienced. 
 He has above average intelligence. 
 I don't know. He is an A's fan. 
 I have not noticed any symptoms 
 significant enough to alert Dr. Lim, 
 but even with a decline 
 in executive function, 
 he might not show serious deficits. 
 I think we should definitely 
 discuss it further, 
 over sauteed artichokes. 
 I am not hungry, 
 but I will come and keep you company 
 while I continue to work. 
 If Glassy can still do brain surgery 
 and you haven't seen 
 any serious deficits... 
 There is definitely something 
 wrong with his brain. 
 He's getting older. 
 It happens to everyone. 
 This is not just aging. 
 I know Dr. Glassman. 
 Do you think Glassman 
 is a danger to his patients? 
 No. 
 Not yet. 
 Then let's go to Barone's 
 and eat some meatballs 
 and chicken wings that I will 
 enjoy for a few glorious hours 
 until the indigestion kicks in. 
 You are right. 
 Meatball, stat. 
 That's the last 
 anastomosis. Remove the clamp. 
 Looks like the sutures are holding. 
 I can't believe we did 
 a Whipple in under six hours. 
 That's gotta be a record. 
 More importantly, no more tumor, 
 no more bleeding ulcer. 
 Went even better than I'd hoped. 
 Gotta give the good Lord his due. 
 Eddie is truly blessed. 
 We need a few more 
 -  prolenes on a Castro 
 and two surgical drains. 
 Hey. You got your gear for tonight? 
 Yep. 
 Dug out the old football cleats. 
 Awesome. 
 Samira's really looking forward 
 to meeting you. 
 Don't worry. I respect your recovery. 
 - I'm not trying to set you up. 
 - Thank you. 
 Jordan also told me she'd k*ll me 
 if I did anything 
 to tempt you off your path. 
 You and Dr. Allen were talking about me? 
 Yeah. She was just making sure I 
 knew what you were dealing with. 
 She's definitely looking out for you. 
 My head. It's gonna explode. 
 He has a thunderclap headache 
 and double vision. 
 His left eyelid's droopy, 
 looks like complete third nerve palsy. 
 Left pupil non-reactive to light. 
 The PCOM aneurysm must have ruptured. 
 We need to get him to the OR, stat. 
 Page Dr. Glassman. 
 Scalpel. 
 Intracranial pressure is dropping. 
 We've bought him some temporary relief. 
 Can we see the CT scans, 
 the new ones, please? 
 Given the subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
 the risk of the previous 
 surgical plan has increased. 
 I can still clip 
 the two smaller aneurysms, 
 then ligate and bypass the ruptured one. 
 We should consider coil embolization 
 of the ruptured aneurysm. 
 We treat that now and then 
 come back for the other two 
 once Ricky has recovered. 
 Then he has to come in every 
 six months for an angiogram, 
 weakening his muscles, 
 damaging his coordination, 
 effectively ending his pro career. 
 That's your recommendation? 
 The treatment is a much safer option. 
 He's   . 
 He has lots of life 
 to consider after baseball. 
 I'm confident in what I promised. 
 I'm confident that I can deliver it. 
 Your experience mitigates 
 the increased risks 
 of the craniotomy, 
 but it does not eliminate them. 
 The patient should decide. 
 Fine. 
 Let's wake him up 
 and present both plans. 
 The surgery went better 
 than we could have hoped. 
 We removed the tumor, 
 and your liver and pancreas 
 are working great. 
 So when do I get to go home? 
 Well, we need to keep an eye 
 on you for a couple days. 
 I took the liberty of 
 getting you a few things 
 to help pass the time. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm so grateful to you all. 
 I've spent so much time on my own, 
 I can forget how wonderful it is 
 to have other people there 
 who care about you. 
 Hey. Sorry. I got 
 a little aggro last night. 
 My family was big on dinner debate time. 
 Okay. 
 That's all you have to say? 
 I have a blood draw to do, so... 
 It was just a philosophical discussion. 
 It's not like we got 
 into a fight, right? 
 No, we didn't. 
 - It was awful. 
 - Terrible. 
 Somebody's in a good mood. 
 Indeed I am. 
 It's the Eddie effect. 
 Our patient radiates positivity. 
 It's oddly contagious. 
 It's got me wondering 
 why I'm always so focused 
 on choosing the right path instead of... 
 just being open to God's gifts. 
 Sorry. 
 My gift is using my stomach 
 as a speedbag. 
 I don't know what's worse... 
 that I might not walk out of here, 
 or walking out knowing that 
 I'll never play ball again. 
 Yes. That is the question 
 you need to answer. 
 Don't get stuck on worst-case scenarios. 
 I worked real hard to get here, 
 you know? 
 And I... And I got 
 people counting on me... 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Shut out the noise. 
 Other people are gonna have opinions, 
 whether you swing  - , 
 whether you don't take the extra base. 
 Whatever decision you make, 
 that's gonna be the right decision. 
 You know, uh, there's a... 
 There's a saying 
 back in the DR... 
 ""You can't walk off the island."" 
 You gotta take big swings. 
 Let's fix all the aneurysms now. 
 Good call. 
 You'll need to keep 
 the wound site clean and dry. 
 And be sure to monitor 
 her caloric intake closely. 
 Babies with Turner Syndrome 
 have difficulty swallowing 
 and tongue dysfunction. 
 Turner Syndrome? 
 Will she need additional surgeries? 
 Yes, but not for a few years. 
 With things like this, 
 it's best to take it one step at a time. 
 We were hoping to foster to adopt. 
 And these long-term medical issues... 
 they're significant. 
 When it comes to medicine, 
 Google is not your friend. 
 Patrick, Annie, 
 I know it all sounds scary, 
 and you have every right to be nervous. 
 But you can do this. 
 Eden needs you. 
 Wouldn't it be best for Eden 
 if you found someone more qualified? 
 I'll let Social Services know. 
 What's the score? 
 How am I doing? My executive function. 
 What's the score? 
 It is not a score, it is data, 
 and I am not ready 
 to draw my conclusions. 
 Well, you're wasting your time. 
 You should focus on people 
 who actually need you. 
 I'm fine. 
 I am focused on you... 
 because for most of my life, 
 you've watched out for me. 
 No one asked you to do it. 
 You chose to. 
 Sometimes when I didn't want you to. 
 I'm very glad you did. 
 So no matter what anyone, 
 including you, says, 
 I am going to watch out for you. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's fantastic. 
 These are incredible, seriously. 
 I didn't mean to interrupt. 
 No, Dalisay was just showing me 
 her watercolor landscapes. 
 She's a wonderful painter. 
 Really? I had no idea. 
 There's increased output 
 in his J.P. drains. 
 That's not surprising, 
 considering your EV. 
 Send a sample to the lab 
 and add meropenem 
 to his antibiotic regimen, 
 just to be safe. 
 Your recovery looks to be on track. 
 And we've made significant advances 
 in plastic surgery techniques 
 since your last consult. 
 Yeah, I don't doubt it. 
 But we both know 
 it would still be painful, 
 and they'd just grow back anyway. 
 There's one thing I've learned 
 from the home reno business, 
 ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" 
 A proverb for the ages. 
 I wanted to say goodbye. 
 The foster parents backed out. 
 She's scrambling to find someone else. 
 I don't have another family lined up. 
 Can you give me more time? 
 N-No. 
 Eden needs a home, and I know 
 the perfect person to foster her. 
 Me. 
 One down, two to go. 
 It's been five hours. 
 Do you need a break? 
 Not when I have a   -year-old Macallan 
 waiting for me at the finish line. 
 Fenestrated aneurysm clip. 
 We've got an intra-op rupture. 
 Bleed is massive. 
 Suction. Both of you, suction. 
 Let's keep this field clear. 
 Should we try balloon occlusion? 
 - Or a flow diverting stent? 
 - No. 
 We should adjust the clips 
 to get better proximal 
 and distal control 
 and pivot to a Muslin wrapping. 
 Push   mg bolus adenosine. 
 We're gonna stop the heart. 
 Push it, please. Push it. 
 Aneurysm clips. 
 Oh. That is very innovative. 
 Inducing a brief cardiac arrest 
 reduces blood flow to the aneurysm. 
 Gives us time to apply the clips. 
 Okay. Let us proceed with 
 the parent vessel reconstruction. 
 One more time, 
 fenestrated aneurysm clip. 
 Thank you. 
 That was exciting. 
 He's in Vfib, 
 not responding to chest 
 compressions or epi... 
 We need to shock him. Charge to    , 
 and push another milligram of epi. 
 He must have thrown a clot. 
 Clear! 
 Time of death,  :  . 
 His underlying illness 
 weakened his immune system 
 and made his blood 
 more susceptible to clots. 
 There's nothing we could have done. 
 Do you know what hospital you're in? 
 St. Bonaventure. 
 And why are you here? 
 Aneurysms, which you were 
 supposed to fix. 
 Which we did. And we did quite well. 
 In fact, if you stick to your rehab, 
 you might be back 
 on the field by mid-season. 
 Thank you, Dr. Glassman. 
 You got a surgery that can 
 help me hit a curveball? 
 Try hitting a knuckleball. 
 You don't know what it is 
 until, pfft, it's too late. 
 That's old school. 
 I haven't even seen one in a game. 
 Oh, I used to throw 
 a knuckleball, actually, 
 back in the day. 
 I tried to be a pitcher. 
 But I didn't have a fastball... 
 And then you 
 have no idea where it's gonna go 
 'cause it had just a... 
 Just a slight amount of spin. 
 You heard? 
 Thank you for checking on me. 
 Andrews was right. 
 There's nothing more we could have done. 
 I'm really sorry about your patient, 
 but I actually came to tell you 
 that I'm meeting up 
 with some friends tonight. 
 I'm gonna go back to my place after. 
 Okay. 
 But what's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 I've been meaning to see 
 these folks for a while, and... 
 we're meeting near my place. 
 No big deal. 
 Well, it's starting to feel like one. 
 Clearly, you're mad. 
 Please tell me what I did. 
 Sometimes having a conversation with you 
 feels like combat. 
 Well, I was just stating my opinion. 
 No, you were obliterating all 
 other opinions, including mine. 
 And calling me a complete 
 moron in the process. 
 I have never said that you were a moron. 
 - I said... 
 - Ash, I didn't grow up 
 discussing religion 
 or quoting Marx at the dinner table. 
 That doesn't mean 
 I don't value your opinion. 
 It doesn't seem like it 
 when you take a sledgehammer 
 to my every argument. 
 I can give you     examples 
 of times when... 
 This is not another argument 
 for you to win. 
 I have to get to dinner. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 If you want some company 
 or someone to talk to... 
 It's alright. I'll be okay. 
 I know. 
 But... 
 if you change your mind, 
 I've got your back. 
 Like you've had mine. 
 Thank you. 
 You... 
 really see me. 
 I think maybe you and I 
 could be gifts to each other. 
 And we should be open to that. 
 I have no idea what it looks 
 like for us to move forward. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 Dalisay. 
 Dr. Andrews. 
 Your landscapes you 
 showed Eddie before he... 
 I think you shared them with him 
 because he was so open-hearted. 
 See, my whole life, I've believed 
 that success only came 
 from constant striving, 
 constant dissatisfaction 
 with where I was 
 or what I'd accomplished. 
 Contentment was a sign of complacency. 
 That's no way to go through life. 
 I know. 
 And I know I didn't 
 show you enough respect, 
 and I didn't make enough effort 
 to see things from your point of view. 
 But I want to change. 
 I want to value the people I care about 
 and who might care about me. 
 And if I haven't screwed up 
 too badly, then maybe one day, 
 I'll be worthy enough 
 to see those landscapes. 
 How about dinner? 
 You pick me up at  :  , Saturday. 
 We can try that Filipino place. 
 Why would you say that? 
 - You know... 
 - Oh, man. 
 Hey, what else do you say 
 in that situation? 
 I think I agree with the guy. 
 I mean, I think he's... I think... 
 You were right. 
 I have a tendency to go 
 scorched earth in a debate 
 because I just want to win. 
 I lose sight of what's 
 important because I'm... 
 I-I'm a moron. 
 But today, I realized 
 I shouldn't take anything 
 or anyone for granted. 
 You showed me what 
 it truly means to belong, 
 to not be an island. 
 And I just feel so blessed 
 to be in your life. 
 Uh, and you should order 
 the salmon carpaccio. 
 It's delightful here. It's like butter. 
 Is your boyfriend 
 really that passionate, 
 or is he a little insane? 
 Both. 
 Hi. 
 I thought I'd stop by, 
 see how you and Eden are settling in. 
 We're fine, so far. 
 I think. 
 I'm fairly sure I have 
 everything Eden needs, 
 though peds might find 
 a few things missing 
 from their inventory this month. 
 I don't see one of these. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, Eden will love it. 
 Thank you. 
 Toys. 
 Onesies. I need to get a stroller... 
 Hey, you'll handle it. 
 It's the perfect practice run 
 for when your own comes along. 
 I'm going off my IVF meds. 
 I'm not doing another cycle. 
 Eden, 
 she's what I've been waiting for. 
 She's my daughter. 
 This is a knuckleball, and it fooled me. 
 I thought it was Dr. Glassman's 
 cancer returning, 
 but it is damage to Dr. Glassman's brain 
 as a result of a mini-stroke. 
 If that were the case, 
 the area would have smooth edges. 
 Mmm, usually, yes. 
 But rare presentations 
 can show abnormalities 
 like these rough edges, 
 particularly when the patient 
 has had radiation treatment. 
 It explains why his memory 
 has been impacted, 
 especially during periods 
 of intense focus 
 involving many sequential steps. 
 It is permanent. 
 He shouldn't be doing surgery anymore.","[""ut something else? \n I mean, look at terrorism, \n the countless wars, \n the KKK, al-Qaeda, \n bombed abortion clinics, \n the as*ault on women's rights, \n not to mention \n the rampant persecution \n of the LGBTQ""]",True

 ( 
 Meredith is in bed, naked, her alarm starts going off. Derek reaches around her to cuddle. 
 ) 
 MVO: Ok, anyone who says you can sleep when you die, tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern. Of course, it's not just the job that keeps us up all night. 
 Meredith: You have to get up now. 
 Derek: What? My God, what time is it? 
 ( 
 She rolls on top of him 
 ) 
 Meredith: It's 5:20, and I have pre-rounds. And you have to leave before they see you. 
 Derek: Oh, come on, now. Why don't you just let them see? 
 ( 
 He rolls on top of her 
 ) 
 Meredith: No! 
 Derek: Please! 
 Meredith: No, No! 
 ( 
 Izzie is watching coffee percolate in the kitchen when George enters 
 ) 
 George: You get any sleep? 
 Izzie: Oh, she could oil the bedsprings as a courtesy or at least buy a padded headboard. 
 George: So who's the guy? 
 Izzie: You think it was just one guy doing all that work? 
 George: Yeah, do you mind if I don't think about that? 
 Izzie: Oh, jealous? 
 George: I'm not jealous. 
 Izzie: Well, I am. But at least I know she'll be having a long day at work. 
 ( 
 Derek tries to sneak out but Izzie and George see him 
 ) 
 Izzie: Well, at least we know brain surgery isn't his only skill. 
 George: They can't be...He's her boss. 
 Izzie: We're late. He's all of our boss. You know she has been scrubbing in a lot lately on his surgeries. 
 George: No, Meredith wouldn't sleep with him just to...No. 
 Izzie: Well, if she's not ashamed of it, why is she keeping it a secret? 
 George: Maybe she didn't. Maybe it just happened. You know, spontaneously, last night. 
 ( 
 Meredith enters kitchen 
 ) 
 Meredith: Hi. Good morning. 
 Izzie: Morning. Hey, so it sounded like you were having some pretty radical sex last night, all night long. Who was the guy? 
 Meredith: no one you know. 
 Izzie: We're late. Let's go. 
 MVO: I mean, if life's so hard already, why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves? What's up with the need to hit the self-destruct button? 
 ( 
 They arrive at work and get out of the car. Cristina is on the parking lot on her motorcycle. 
 ) 
 Meredith: Yikes, wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley. 
 Cristina: Right back at ya. 
 ( 
 Alex jogs up 
 ) 
 Izzie: A run? You run? 
 Alex: Every day, babe, every day. 
 Meredith: Not suffering enough? 
 Alex: What doesn't k*ll you, makes you stronger. 
 Cristina: Don't go acting all indefatigable. You're dragging like the rest of us. Oh, what is that, professional weakness, Dr. Yang? 
 Cristina: It's called the flu. 
 Alex: Yeah. 
 ( 
 Interns are in the locker room 
 ) 
 George: I'm gonna need a major rush to make it through this day. I need a kick-ass surgery. 
 Alex: Ooh, you a bad boy last night, George? 
 Izzie: That would be Meredith. 
 Alex: You a bad boy, Meredith? 
 Cristina: Do tell. 
 Meredith: Nothing to tell. 
 Cristina: That says it all, huh? 
 ( 
 Izzie slams locker door 
 ) 
 Meredith: Sorry, I have a sex life. 
 Alex: Don't apologize. Embrace it. Share it. Count me in. 
 Izzie: Yeah, next time, just let me know if I need to go to a hotel so I can get some sleep. 
 Meredith: Am I missing something? 
 George: You were just a little loud. 
 ( 
 Everyone leaves except Meredith and Cristina 
 ) 
 Cristina: Do they know its McDreamy keeping them up all night? 
 Meredith: I hope not. I already have Bailey riding me, I don't need my roommates thinking I'm getting special treatment. 
 ( 
 All interns are in hallway with Bailey. Meredith yawns 
 ) 
 Bailey: O'Malley, Yang, Karev, go on to clinic. 
 ( 
 George and Bailey watch Derek putting in eye drops through the window 
 ) 
 Bailey: O'Malley, patients are waiting. You two come with me. Izzie, you're hanging with me today. Good morning, Dr. Shepherd. 
 Derek: Dr. Bailey. Late night, Grey? 
 Meredith: No, caffeine just hasn't kicked in yet. If you're at all religious, you would want to start praying it kicks in soon. There's a consult in the pit. Girl with a fever and abdominal pain. After that, Nicholas in 3311 needs his meds. Mr. Moeller's IV fell out, and he's a hard stick. Postops in 1337, 3342, 3363, and 2381. 
 Meredith: 381. 3342, 3363, and 23... 
 Bailey: Why are you still standing in front of me? ( 
 Meredith leaves 
 ) ( 
 To Izzie 
 ) You look more like me than you right now. What's the matter? 
 Izzie: Nothing 
 Woman: Help! I need immediate help. 
 Bailey: What's the problem? 
 Woman: My damn boyfriend swallowed my keys. 
 Man: ( 
 With difficulty 
 ) I didn't want her to leave. 
 Bailey: Locate the lady's keys. 
 ( 
 Meredith is examining a girl about 18. Claire Rice is biting her nails. 
 ) 
 Mrs. Rice: I think she got some bug on her trip to Mexico with her friends. I told her not to go to a Third-World country, but does she ever listen? 
 Mr. Rice: She's been weak ever since and she's lost weight. 
 Claire: Barely. 
 Mr. Rice: And this morning, she passed out in the shower. 
 Meredith: When was the trip? 
 Claire: A couple weeks ago. I'm really fine. I just have a fever. 
 Meredith: Ok, well, will you lie back for an exam for me? 
 Claire: No, please, I don't need an exam. Just give me some antibiotics and send me home. 
 Meredith: Well, maybe it is just a fever, but they called down for a surgeon, so I have to give the ok to let you go. So just let me do the exam. 
 Mr. Rice: Do the exam. 
 Claire: No. This is crazy. I'm fine. 
 Mrs. Rice: For God's sake, Claire, I don't want to spend my entire day here. 
 Meredith: You know, actually, Mrs. Rice, this might be easier if we had some privacy. So would you two mind leaving the room? 
 Mr. Rice: That's fine. 
 ( 
 Hospital admitting 
 ) 
 Digby: Digby. Digby Owens. I have an appointment. 
 Alex: Excuse me, sir, uh, you're bleeding. You mind if I... 
 Digby: Sure, sure. Have a look. 
 Alex: That's a g*nsh*t. 
 Digby: Yeah. 
 Alex: We got a g*nsh*t wound. We got to get him down to the pit. 
 ( 
 Cristina runs up with wheelchair 
 ) 
 Alex: Sit, Mr... 
 Digby: Uh, Digby. All right, but it isn't an emergency. I scheduled it. 
 Alex: What, the g*nsh*t? 
 Digby: Yeah. My buddy shot me. 
 Cristina: Buddy? 
 Digby: Yeah, just as a favor. 
 Cristina: On purpose? 
 Digby: Hell, yeah. I mean he wasn't trying to hurt me or nothing, but you know... 
 Alex: But why? 
 Digby: I like the scars. 
 ( 
 Alex is cleaning Digby's wound 
 ) 
 Digby: Look, everyone in town has tats, but my art is about commitment. 
 Alex: So, this is your art, huh? 
 Digby: Damn straight. 
 Cristina: Damn stupid. The b*llet went all the way through. 
 Digby: Bounced off my ribs. I have another one still in my shoulder. Nice, huh? 
 Cristina: ( 
 Sarcastically 
 ) You could hang it in the Louvre. 
 Digby: I have an ethos. Why do anything unless you're willing to go one step further than anybody else? 
 Alex: What doesn't k*ll you makes you stronger. 
 Digby: Exactly. And pain is the great divide. My coach used to say, it's all about how we process pain. 
 Alex: Football? 
 Digby: Wrestling, Iowa State. 
 Alex: Iowa, 141. 
 Digby: 157. 
 Alex: You got to be more than 180 now. 
 Digby: I'd like to see you get back under 145. 
 Cristina: Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to...puke. 
 Alex: There's a flu going around the hospital. 
 Digby: Somewhat ironic. 
 ( 
 Meredith examining Claire. 
 ) 
 Claire: Ow. Don't push so hard. 
 Meredith: Can you lift your shirt so I can examine your stomach? 
 ( 
 She lifts her shirt to reveal pink scars 
 ) 
 Meredith: Where did you get these? Claire...you've had surgery recently. These scars are still pink. 
 Claire: Don't tell my parents. 
 Meredith: You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know? What did you have done? 
 ( 
 George with a young child, her foot is twitching 
 ) 
 George: Ahh. And you noticed her foot twitching? Come on, Jamie. 
 Jamie: My foot. 
 George: Oh, yeah. About three months ago? 
 Mrs. Hayes: Just a little. We took her to County Hospital and she got the CT scan, which showed her... 
 George: Brain abnormality. Here, you can put it...And the twitching has gotten worse? 
 Mr. Hayes: A lot worse. They just don't have the proper equipment back home to figure out what's wrong. 
 George: You did a... you did a good thing. 
 Jamie: Show Mommy. 
 George: Yes, your mommy. 
 Jamie: Show Mommy and Daddy. 
 George: Ok, you did a good thing by coming all this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes. You sit tight Jamie, ok? I'm gonna bring in Dr. Shepherd to see you, ok. 
 Jamie: Shepherd. 
 George: Ok? Dr. Shepherd. Ok? He's the brain specialist. 
 Jamie: Mommy and Daddy. 
 Mrs. Hayes: Doctor? Is he good, this Dr. Shepherd? 
 George: At just about everything. 
 ( 
 Bailey and Izzie looking at films of the man who swallowed his girlfriend's keys. 
 ) 
 Bailey: I assume the lady needs her keys to leave this guy's sorry ass behind. 
 Izzie: Yeah. 
 Bailey: Well, help her out. 
 ( 
 Start to walk through hall 
 ) 
 Izzie: He needs a bronchoscopy. 
 Bailey: See one, do one, teach one. You've seen one. It's time to do one. 
 Izzie: Alone? Seriously? Thanks. I mean, the vote of confidence in my skills and all. I didn't think you well, anyone was noticing how hard I've been working... 
 Bailey: Izzie? Go. 
 Izzie: Yeah. 
 ( 
 Bailey runs into Meredith 
 ) 
 Meredith: You paged? 
 Bailey: Where are we? 
 Meredith: I did the consult, did the IV, the meds, the Postops, everything. 
 Bailey: How is your pit patient? 
 Meredith: She's febrile and has peritoneal signs. 
 ( 
 Cristina walks by 
 ) 
 Bailey: you all right, Dr. Yang? 
 Cristina: Fine. On my way back to clinic. 
 ( 
 Cristina walks away looking very sick 
 ) 
 Meredith: I think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in Mexico. 
 Bailey: Botched abortion? 
 Meredith: No! She has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen and won't say what they're from, the parents are clueless. 
 Bailey: She's a minor. 
 Meredith: Seventeen. Freshman in college. 
 Bailey: You order up for a CT? 
 Meredith: Yes. 
 Bailey: So while she's there, the nurses couldn't get a Foley on Mr. Garay. He may need a Coude cath if you can't get a normal one in there. Write up postop notes on all surgical-floor patients that had surgery within the last 24 hours. Be sure to document their EKG's and x-rays. Hunt them down if you can't find them. 
 Meredith: Right away. 
 ( 
 Cristina is standing the hallway still sick and Burke walks up 
 ) 
 Burke: Hey. Whoa. Got the flu? 
 Cristina: Yeah, and thanks for it. It's making my life so much easier. 
 Burke: I didn't give it to you. It's all over the hospital. You should be in bed. 
 Cristina: Disease, diagnosis and prescription from one man. 
 Burke: Seriously, I'll give you a ride home. 
 Cristina: This is not gonna make me go home. You go home. 
 Burke: But I feel fine. 
 ( 
 Burke shrugs then feels his glands 
 ) 
 ( 
 George is walking through hallway, runs up to Izzie 
 ) 
 George: Hey, hey, hey. Have you seen Shepherd? 
 Izzie: Not as up close as Meredith has. 
 George: What? Are you trying to get her in trouble? She's our friend. 
 Izzie: George, this program will make or break our careers. Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't. And that decision depends entirely on recommendations from doctors like Shepherd. There is a reason we don't sleep with the attendings. 
 George: It's not her fault, ok. It's Shepherd's. He's the attending, he should know better. He's taking advantage of her. 
 Izzie: It didn't exactly sound like anything was happening against her will last night. 
 ( 
 Derek in surgery 
 ) 
 Derek: Ok, I think we're in good shape here. 
 Nurse: I think so, Dr. Shepherd. 
 Derek: Looks good. 
 ( 
 George is watching from the scrub room, an x-ray tech enters 
 ) 
 X-ray Tech: Here you go, doc. The kid's CTs just arrived from County. Thanks. 
 ( 
 Dr. Taylor enters 
 ) 
 Dr. Taylor: Excuse me. 
 George: Sorry, Dr. Taylor. 
 ( 
 He enters surgery 
 ) 
 X-ray Tech: That would be bourbon. 
 George: What? 
 X-ray Tech: I smelled it too. And he's the best anesthesiologist on the staff. I'll worry when he's too juiced to do his crossword puzzle. 
 ( 
 Dr. Taylor starts working on his crossword puzzle 
 ) 
 Derek: Will you close up for me? Thank you everyone. 
 ( 
 In the hall outside of the surgery 
 ) 
 George: Dr. Shepherd... 
 Derek: I got to get some coffee. 
 George: Jamie Hayes has been admitted. The little girl with the brain abnormality. 
 Derek: How's she presenting? 
 George: She has what looks like continuous seizure activity in her left foot. Her balance is off. Her parents have come along way to find out what's wrong. 
 ( 
 Derek looks at CT films 
 ) 
 Derek: How old are there? 
 George: Three months old. 
 Derek: I need new ones. Her brain could look dramatically different today. 
 George: Ok, I'll order them... 
 Derek: Thank you. 
 ( 
 Elevator door closes 
 ) 
 George: ...doc. 
 ( 
 Alex and Burke looking at Digby's x-rays. 
 ) 
 Burke: And that? 
 Alex: That's a b*llet from a previous g*nsh*t. 
 Burke: Previous g*nsh*t? Ok. 
 Alex: No reason to take it out. 
 Burke: No, the guy likes pain. 
 Alex: It's his ethos. 
 Burke: Pain as an ethos? Wait, I think I know this guy. 
 ( 
 Bailey walks in, Burke shows her the x-rays 
 ) 
 Burke: You remember this guy? 
 Bailey: Hey, the tattooed masochist. 
 Burke: Had himself shot again. 
 Bailey: Glad to see he's still stupid. 
 Alex: It's his ethos. 
 Burke: Let's go tell him what he gets to do today. 
 ( 
 Meredith has been sitting at a desk unnoticed 
 ) 
 Meredith: Dr. Bailey? Claire Rice's abdominal CTs. 
 Bailey: Is this girl fat? 
 Meredith: Not at all. She's a normal college kid. 
 Bailey: So, what do you see? 
 Meredith: Her stomach's stapled. She's had a gastric bypass. 
 Bailey: And a bad one, at that. 
 ( 
 Bailey and Meredith in the hall talking to Mr. And Mrs. Rice. 
 ) 
 Meredith: Gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients to help them lose weight. 
 Mr. Rice: Claire? She doesn't need to lose weight. 
 Mrs. Rice: Are you kidding? This means the world to her. ( 
 To Meredith and Bailey 
 ) But it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out. She's done it with everything since she was a little kid. 
 Bailey: Mrs. Rice, nothing about this is gonna be easy. She's gonna face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure. 
 Mrs. Rice: Do the surgery. ( 
 To Mr. Rice 
 ) I told her to watch the freshman 15. Don't eat junk, exercise. But when she came home Christmas, who had to take her out and buy her a brand new pair of size 6 jeans because she couldn't get in the ones I got her last summer? 
 Mr. Rice: Tina, you know, she tries so hard. She does. She gets good grades. She gets A's. 
 Mrs. Rice: She has illegal surgery in Mexico. 
 Bailey: Unfortunately, there were complications with the bypass. 
 Mr. Rice: What do you mean? 
 Bailey: She has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm, and edema, which is a swelling of the bowel wall. I can't say for certain she'll recover completely. 
 Mr. Rice: Just do whatever you have to do to make her well, ok? 
 ( 
 Derek is in Jamie's room 
 ) 
 Derek: you look like a princess. Do you know you're a princess? 
 Jamie: It's not lipstick. 
 Derek: It's not lipstick? No, it's not lipstick. Want to do my shoulder? Oh, good. 
 Jamie: And nose? 
 Derek: We're gonna find out what's causing these seizures. Does MRI know we're coming down? 
 George: You said CT. 
 Derek: Now I'm saying MRI. 
 George: It's available. 
 Derek: Good. 
 Mr. Hayes: Doctor, is she gonna need surgery? 
 Derek: I don't know yet. 
 Mr. Hayes: It's just that my wife and I, we both work and I don't know if our insurance... 
 Mrs. Hayes: We know it can be very expensive. 
 Derek: I don't want you to worry about that. 
 ( 
 Jamie legs starts twitching quickly. 
 ) 
 Derek: It's a focal, left-side seizure. Ok, let's get the diazepam running now, please. 
 Nurse: Diazepam, IV. 
 Derek: Tourniquet please. Jaime, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna put this on your arm, ok? Isn't that fun? Here, we're gonna put that right there, like that. And this is gonna feel cold. This is a butterfly. Butterfly fly lands right there. Good. Blanket for the butterfly. Good, nicely done. 
 ( 
 Jamie's leg stops twitching 
 ) 
 Derek: It's amazing stuff, isn't it? 
 Mrs. Hayes: Um-hmm. 
 Derek: Hey, you like spaceships? 
 Jamie: Yeah. 
 Derek: You do? Ok, should we take Captain O'Malley, my first lieutenant, to the spaceship MRI. Let's go. 
 ( 
 Izzie prepares for the procedure on the man who swallowed the keys 
 ) 
 Izzie: It'll be safer to wait until your lunch digests before we do the procedure. 
 Woman: Perfect, this is just perfect. I was hoping to be in Portland right now. 
 Izzie: You're gonna be under conscious sedation JP, which means you'll be awake, but groggy. 
 JP: Wait, wait. Is this gonna hurt? 
 Izzie: You'll have some discomfort but we'll give you something for the pain. 
 Woman: Do you know how stupid you make me look. 
 JP: I thought you would think this is funny. 
 Woman: Funny? 
 JP: Romantic? 
 Woman: Like the therapist thing was funny and romantic? 
 JP: That was funny. 
 Woman: No, that was sad. He called my therapist pretending to be his therapist, to find out what I'd said about him. 
 Izzie: That's a little passive-aggressive, JP? 
 Woman: A little? He is the king of passive-aggressive. And he's manipulative...and needy... 
 Izzie: Well, that's the trifecta. 
 JP: What do I win? ( 
 Izzie shakes her head 
 ) What? 
 ( 
 Digby is waiting on a gurney in the hallway when Burke and Alex walk up 
 ) 
 Digby: Doc! 
 Burke: I'd prefer we stop meeting like this, Mr. Owens. 
 Digby: Digby. So how's the trumpet playing? 
 Burke: Very safe, compared to your hobby. Getting shot is a little more risky. 
 Alex: That's kind of the point. 
 Burke: He's running a fever. 
 Alex: Due to the extra stress on his body from the g*nsh*t. 
 Burke: Digby, the impact of the b*llet on your chest fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax. 
 Digby: That sucks, I guess. 
 Alex: Well, there's blood in your collapsed lung. 
 Burke: The price of body art went up since your last g*nsh*t. 
 Digby: Ah, no pain, no gain, right? 
 Burke: That's one way to look at it. 
 Alex: We have that in common, you docs and me. 
 Burke: Do we? 
 Digby: Yeah, the way you guys push, push, and push. When I was wrestling, if you wanted to pin me, you was gonna have to k*ll me. 
 Alex: Iowa style. 
 Digby: Iowa State style. Back home, we were sworn enemies. But in Seattle, man, we're brothers. So, what are we gonna do about this, um...hemopneumo-Jurassics? 
 Alex: We're gonna insert a chest tube to drain the blood, then re-inflate your lung. 
 Burke: Oh, please...tell me I get to watch. 
 ( 
 Burke leaves 
 ) 
 Alex: Oh, man, Iowa style. 
 ( 
 Claire's mom enters her room angrily 
 ) 
 Claire: Before you guys start, I know you're mad. 
 Mrs. Rice: Disbelief, Claire, just disbelief. 
 Mr. Rice: I'm just concerned. Where did you get the idea to do this? 
 Claire: The internet. 
 Mrs. Rice: But, honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight. 
 Claire: Yeah, I tried that, but...it doesn't work for me like it does for you. 
 Mr. Rice: Hey, you don't need to lose weight. 
 Mrs. Rice: What are you eating? And how much have you been working out? I mean, you know, most of the time, when people hit their target weight, they have to work to stay there. 
 ( 
 Meredith is looking on 
 ) 
 Claire: Everyone gains weight in college, Mom. It's...it's stressful. There's...there's not enough time for exercise. I just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then...I could focus more on my studies. 
 Mrs. Rice: So you took yet another shortcut? Life doesn't work that way, Claire. 
 Mr. Rice: Tina! 
 Mrs. Rice: What? You want to argue this? 
 ( 
 He shuts up 
 ) 
 Mrs. Rice: ( 
 To Meredith 
 ) She has so much potential id she would just apply herself... 
 Meredith: Ok. Ok, I think we should focus on taking care of your daughter. And, Claire, your parents agree, the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass. 
 Claire: No! No, it's my body. I do not want surgery again. Please? 
 Meredith: There were serious complications. And this is about your health. 
 Claire: But I'd rather be thin. 
 Mrs. Rice: Well, I'm afraid the choice isn't up to you. 
 ( 
 Jamie is in CT scan and Derek and her parents are looking at the results 
 ) 
 Derek: It's called Rasmussen's encephalitis. What it amounts to is that this side of her brain...( 
 Points to screen 
 ) This part's all healthy, working perfectly. This black part of the brain, this...all of that is dead, or dying. The condition has gotten radically worse since her CT scans three months ago. Left untreated, the disease is gonna k*ll her. 
 Mrs. Hayes: How soon? 
 Derek: Too soon. 
 Mr. Hayes: So is there a cure? 
 Derek: The treatment requires the diseased portion of her brain be removed and sealed off. See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity. 
 Mr. Hayes: R-Remove? But, I mean, that's... 
 Derek: Half her brain, yes. 
 Mrs. Hayes: Half her brain. That...seems impossible. 
 Derek: Her age makes it possible. Her brain's not fully developed, so the remaining neurons will compensate for the loss. 
 ( 
 Mrs. Hayes runs out, George follows 
 ) 
 Mr. Hayes: But will she be normal? 
 ( 
 Derek and Mr. Hayes walk out. Jamie is on a gurney in the hall. 
 ) 
 Derek: There are risks to any surgery. And this is, you know, a major one. But if we're successful, Jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks, go on to live a relatively normal life. Look, I know this is a lot to digest. The important thing to remember is that we can save her life. 
 Mrs. Hayes: Thank you. 
 ( 
 Mr. and Mrs. Hayes go with Jamie 
 ) 
 Derek: Dr. O'Malley? 
 George: Yes? What? ( 
 Sounds irritated 
 ) 
 Derek: I'm sorry to bother you but if the parents consent I thought you'd like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy. Are you in, or not? 
 George: Uh, in. 
 Derek: Good. 
 ( 
 Meredith is standing in hallway eating a cookie and looking nauseous. 
 ) 
 George: Yang. I'm scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with Shepherd. 
 Cristina: Get out! I would k*ll for that. 
 George: We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain and it's going to work. It's outrageous. Almost makes it hard to hate him. 
 Cristina: Why do you hate him? 
 George: Oh, no reason. 
 Cristina: You know about him and Meredith? 
 George: You know? 
 Cristina: When are you gonna figure out that I know everything? 
 ( 
 Izzie walks up stairs 
 ) 
 George ( 
 To Izzie 
 ) She knows. 
 Izzie: What, about doctor-cest? 
 Cristina: It's been going on for, like ever. 
 Izzie: Seriously? 
 George: And you didn't tell us? 
 Cristina: Ooh, you're a gossip, huh? 
 George: I am not! 
 Izzie: I am. 
 ( 
 Arrive at hospital coffee shop 
 ) 
 George: He's about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep? Not very responsible. 
 Cristina: Jealous much? Sex all night isn't about being responsible. 
 Izzie: No, it's about sex all night. I can't believe you're not more pissed off about this, you of all people. 
 Cristina: Well, she works hard all day. She's good at her job. Why should you care how she unwinds? I mean, you like to bake all night. Some people like to drink. Others like an occasional screaming orgasm. 
 ( 
 Alex walks up 
 ) 
 Alex: Yeah, we do. Forget I said that. Pretend like I'm not here. Continue. ( 
 To Cristina 
 ) You look like you need to be spoon-fed. 
 Cristina: You look like Alex. 
 George: Yeah, about drinking, Dr. Taylor, the anesthesiologist... ( 
 Nods to where Dr. Taylor is standing nearby 
 ) Do you think he drinks? 
 Cristina: I said, whatever gets you through the day. 
 George: I mean here, at work. Earlier, I thought I smelled...Do you think...? I mean, his patients trust that...So I should say something, right? 
 Alex: It's a can of worms, George. Weren't we talking about sex, anyway? 
 George: Doofus. 
 Izzie: Ew.

 Burke: Don't get any more crazy ideas.

 Alex takes a Polaroid picture. 
 ) 
 Digby: You really think my ideas are crazy? 
 Burke: I'm leaning that way. 
 Alex: We wrestle, he plays trumpet. 
 Digby: Hey, I feel pretty dizzy. 
 Burke: You've lost some blood. 
 Digby: This, too, shall pass. Hey... How come I don't see you down at the Mat in Belltown? 
 Alex: Oh, man, no time. 
 Digby: Bro, make time. I'll be expecting you. 
 Alex: I'm there.

 Bailey and Meredith operating on Claire

 Bailey: Handle with care. This thing's... ( 
 Hands her bowel 
 ) 
 Meredith: Full of gunk. I know. 
 Bailey: We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess. This poor girl. What was she thinking? 
 Meredith: She wants her mother's approval. She wanted to please her. 
 Bailey: And this damage is the result? Here, resect that. 
 Meredith: Needle-tip Bovie, please. ( 
 Hands bowel back to Bailey 
 ) 
 Bailey: When you're done here, you have postops waiting. 
 Meredith: I know, Dr. Bailey. 
 Bailey: Cristina's got the flu. So, you need to pick up the slack in clinic. 
 Meredith: Look, I'll mop the floors, ok? ( 
 Bailey glares at her 
 ) Sorry, that was inappropriate. 
 Bailey: It's not the only thing that's inappropriate. While we're on the subject, you care to tell me what you think you're doing? 
 Meredith: Look, I'll jump through hoops if you want me to. But what I do what I leave this hospital is my business. 
 Bailey: Half this hospital knows your business. Flu isn't the only virus spreading around here. 
 Meredith: I made a choice, and I know you don't respect me for that choice. But I'll live with the consequences. 
 Bailey: Then I'll have lots of hoops for you to jump through. 
 Meredith: I've done everything you've asked me to do. I may not do it your way but it gets done. So whatever else you got, bring it on. 
 ( 
 Claire's bowel burst, spraying Meredith with toxic waste

 George: I appreciate this. The chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is, well...Yeah, I appreciate it. 
 Nurse: Here you go. Triple espresso, not too hot. 
 Derek: Oh, I love you, seriously. 
 Dr. Taylor: Ah, coffee, where would medicine be without it, huh? 
 Derek: I hope you have a new crossword, Taylor. We're gonna be here a while. 
 Dr. Taylor: ( 
 Pointing to crossword in his pocket 
 ) Never go without. Big day for you, kid. Congrats. 
 George: Thanks. 
 Derek: ( 
 To Jamie 
 ) Hey, princess. You ready to take a nap? 
 Dr. Taylor: Hey, look what I got. 
 Derek: Blow bubbles, that's it. Just breathe in. Oh, that's it. 
 Derek: ( 
 To George 
 ) What? 
 George: Do you smell...? 
 Derek: Smell what? I have a mask. 
 George: Uh...I'm sorry, Dr. Taylor, but did you just...? Have you been drinking? 
 Dr. Taylor? I beg your pardon? 
 Derek: What? 
 George: Do you smell...I...I smell alcohol. 
 Dr. Taylor: Where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that? 
 Derek: George, you're out of line. 
 George: There are rules. You know, there are rules for a reason. You just...There is a 2-year-old girl on this table. You shouldn't take advantage of someone else's vulnerability. 
 Dr. Taylor: Look, I don't need some punk intern telling me what's at stake here. Get him out of here, Shep. ( 
 George and Dr. Taylor look at Derek 
 ) Shep? 
 Derek: You're out, George.

 Dr. Taylor: I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

 Izzie retrieving keys from JP's throat 
 ) 
 Woman: Do you really, seriously want to know why I'm leaving?! Seriously? How about when you started insisting that I quit my job, right when I started to make more money than you? That should have been the last straw. No, no. The last straw should have been when I found out that those mysterious phone calls that you've been getting that you kept denying were from other women were really coming from your mother. This isn't healthy. 
 Izzie: Just, hold still, please. 
 Woman: Don't you dare try to patch this up! 
 Izzie: Could the both of you please stop? 
 Woman: You don't love me, JP. You love to smother me. And if I could just get you to admit that, then I could leave you with an ounce of respect. 
 Izzie: Athena, I let you stay in here to keep him calm. So, if you're just gonna keep... 
 Athena: Check that. I can't respect a man desperate enough to swallow my exit strategy. That is the last straw! 
 Izzie: Michelle, can you get her out of here? 
 Michelle: Ma'am? 
 Athena: Fine! 
 Michelle: C'mon. 
 ( 
 JP starts choking 
 ) 
 Athena: What? What's happening? 
 Izzie: The keys moved farther down. 
 Athena: Oh, my God, what does that mean? ( 
 To JP 
 ) What did you do? Don't you dare die, JP! 
 Izzie: Please! Please, just shut up! 
 Athena: Breathe, JP. Just breathe. 
 Izzie: Got it. ( 
 Lifts the keys out 
 ) Very impressive, JP. 
 Athena: Is he ok? Is he gonna be ok? 
 Izzie: Yeah, he'll be fine. 
 ( 
 JP smiles and laughs at Athena 
 ) 
 Athena: You lit...you did that on purpose, didn't you? 
 Izzie: Can I offer you some advice? Get in your car and go, for all of our sakes. 
 JP: You never gonna find where I parked it.

 She grabs the keys and leaves.

 Meredith and Bailey are walking through the hall 
 ) 
 Meredith: I need a shower. 
 Bailey: I need a shower. You need to go tell that girl's parents what kind of kid they're getting back. 
 Meredith: You're not gonna let me shower first? 
 Bailey: That would be a hoop, would it not? 
 Meredith: It would qualify. 
 Bailey: Shower first, then. 
 ( 
 Meredith enters locker room, Izzie and Cristina are inside. 
 ) 
 Izzie: Ew, what smells? 
 Meredith: That would be me, or more specifically, my patient's insides all over me. 
 Izzie: That makes me strangely happy. 
 Cristina: Oh, God. Oh, Meredith, you smell like... 
 Izzie: Karma. 
 Meredith: What? 
 Izzie: Nothing. 
 Cristina: Something vile is stuck in your hair. You know, just go stand over there, please. 
 Meredith: Ugh, how much do I love being a surgeon right now? 
 Izzie: Karma. 
 Meredith: What does karma have to do with anything? 
 Izzie: I'm just saying, you've been given all the best surgeries. And now you smell like putrid goo. And you're giving off a stench. Karma's a bitch. 
 Bailey: ( 
 Entering locker room 
 ) Dr. Shepherd needs an intern in surgery. Which one of you is clear? 
 Cristina: I'm good, Dr. Bailey, where do you want me? 
 Bailey: You need to lie down somewhere. 
 Cristina: I'm fine, I'm completely healthy. 
 Bailey: Grey? 
 Izzie: Of course. 
 Meredith: What is your problem? 
 Izzie: Um, you! 'Cause apparently you can help Dr. McDreamy in ways the rest of us can't. 
 Meredith: You did not just say... 
 Izzie: Yes, I did! 
 Bailey: Hey! ( 
 To Cristina 
 ) Hemispherectomy in OR 1 with Dr. Shepherd. Go.

 Cristina and then Izzie leave

 Burke at desk, Alex enters

 Alex: Doctor. Digby's postop CBC shows a severe spike in the white blood cell count. 
 Burke: What is it? 
 Alex: It's 27, with 16 percent bands. 
 Burke: Something else is wrong. That's a little high for simple stress. Check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness. 
 ( 
 Derek on Jamie's OR 
 ) 
 Derek: All right, we're gonna start the procedure with the left temporal lobectomy. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Yang. After the temporal, we'll do the frontal, and then the occipital.

 Meredith walking through the hall with Mr. and Mrs. Rice. 
 ) 
 Meredith: We were able to reverse the gastric bypass, but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel. And because of the short gut syndrome, Claire will never eat normally again. 
 Mr. Rice: Ok, wait, do...? How do we help her here? 
 Meredith: Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire. 
 Mrs. Rice: Great, as if we already don't have our hands full with her. 
 Meredith: She gets good grades. She stays out of trouble. She's smart. I just think she feels like nothing she does is good enough for you. 
 Mrs. Rice: If you somehow think that I'm responsible for this... 
 Meredith: I think Claire is k*lling herself to please you. 
 Mrs. Rice: Oh, please. You have no idea what's going on in that girl's mind. 
 Meredith: You're her mother. She worships the ground you walk on. She didn't do this for herself. 
 Mrs. Rice: I think that this situation is completely... 
 Mr. Rice: Tina...Shut up.

 Nurse ( 
 Olivia 
 ): His temp's way up, and BP's dropping, doctor. 
 Alex: All right, Digby, have you had any recent illnesses, new piercings, tattoos, wounds? 
 Digby: New tat on my calf. 
 ( 
 Alex flips back blanket to reveal an extremely infected tattoo of a spider on his calf 
 ) 
 Alex: Ew. 
 Digby: Oh, my God. It was nowhere near that nasty this morning. 
 Alex: But it was infected? Why didn't you say anything? 
 Digby: Ah, it was nothing. I'm not here to complain about a little pain. 
 Alex: The infection's been exacerbated by the stress on your body from the g*nsh*t. ( 
 To Olivia 
 ) Get him to ICU. We'll get you started on some antibiotics.

 Derek: From the frontal lobectomy, I'm going to encounter a, uh...

 Jamie although sedated is blinking

 Cristina: We'll encounter the anterior cerebral artery. 
 Derek: Yes, so we're gonna need to, uh... 
 ( 
 Jamie blinks again 
 ) 
 Cristina: The branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided. 
 Derek: You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light. ( 
 No response from Taylor, Jamie still blinking 
 ) Come on, Taylor, s-she's waking up. 
 Cristina: Dr. Taylor? Uh, he's asleep! 
 Derek: ( 
 Screaming 
 ) Taylor! Dr. Taylor! 
 Dr. Taylor: Huh? Oh, God, sorry. Sorry, I'm on it. My bad, Shep. 
 Derek: He was right, wasn't he? 
 Dr. Taylor: Aw, I nodded off. Come on. 
 Derek: Yeah, whatever you got to do to get through the day, right? 
 Dr. Taylor: Steph, get me some coffee. 
 Steph: Yes, doctor. 
 Dr. Taylor: I'll be fine. It won't happen again. 
 Derek: Yeah, not in here, it won't. Uh, Steph, call Dr. Pennington. Hopkins, take over until she gets here. Get out of here and get it together.

 Burke running through hallway, Alex is working on Digby

 Burke: What happened? 
 Alex: He went into multi-system organ failure, secondary to overwhelming sepsis. Now he's all... 
 Burke: Fix his BP, that should help his mental status. 
 Alex: He's maxed out on pressors. We got V-tach. 
 Burke: He's looking bad. Put the defib pads on him and give him 150 of amnioterone. 
 Alex: I lost his pulse. 
 Burke: Defib! Get the pads! Give me the paddles and charge to 200. Clear. (

 Cristina: It will allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity. 
 Derek: Hmm, very nice. 
 Derek: You two, you wanna close up? 
 Doctor: Yes, doctor. 
 Derek: I'm gonna go to bed. 
 Cristina: That was unreal. I mean, that's...that's all there is. I...I was feeling sick until I came here. 
 Derek: I was tired. Now I'm tired again. It's back to reality. 
 ( 
 Derek points to gallery and motions George to come outside 
 ) 
 Derek: Let me explain. 
 George: It's fine. 
 Derek: No, there is a code among doctors. We're not supposed to ask each other questions, not within the walls of this hospital. 
 George: Ok, I was out of line. 
 Derek: No, you weren't. I was. I was out of line. Somebody should have taken responsibility. It should have been the guy doing the cutting. It should have been me. You didn't deserve what happened to you today. You did the right thing code or no code.

 Derek extends his hand for George to shake, George hesitates then shakes his hand 
 ) 
 Derek: You saw me leave the house this morning, didn't you? 
 George: Oh, was that you? 
 Derek: Hmm. I'm not using her. And I don't favor her. 
 George: She's pretty great, you know. 
 Derek: Mm-hmm. So, come on, lets go tell Jamie's parents she's gonna be fine, barring any complications.

 Meredith is wheeling Claire through the hallway

 Claire: So, I won't get fat? 
 Meredith: No.

 Meredith: Claire, I've asked social services to contact your parents.

 Meredith: So you know? 
 Izzie: I know. 
 Meredith: Well, do you want the long, sordid version, or do you want the short version, where I started sleeping with a guy who turned out to be my boss? 
 Izzie: Neither. 
 Meredith: Izzie, cut me some slack here. 
 Izzie: No. You want to Dartmouth. Your mother is Ellis Grey. You grew up... Look at his house! You know, you walk into the OR, and there isn't anyone who doubts that you should be there. I grew up in a trailer park. I went to state school. I put myself through med school by posing in my underwear. You know, I walk into the OR, and everyone hopes I'm the nurse. Y-you have their respect without even trying, and you're throwing it away for...what? A few good surgeries? 
 Meredith: No. It's not about the surgeries. It's not about getting ahead. 
 Izzie: Then what? A little hot sex? You're willing to ruin your credibility over that? I mean, Meredith, what the hell are you doing? ( 
 Izzie stares at Meredith who rolls her eyes

 Meredith: I am not.

 Izzie: Wow, you're all, uh, mushy and...warm and full of secret feelings. ( 
 Hands her cake

 Meredith: I hate you! And your cake.

 Anyone can come up with a clinical trial. 
 I could come up with a clinical trial.

 Oh, Cristina, I can't even think about the sparkle pager because my clinical trial starts today.

 You are exactly the same.

 Nope.

 George had a party? 
 Okay, people, you're about to experience medical history, medical greatness, medical majesty. 
 You're about to experience the beginning of something extraordinary. 
 Take in the moment. 
 Okay, Dr. Grey, did you warn the interns on what to expect? 
 I told them to expect greatness. 
 Yes, in addition to all the greatness, the patient may be inappropriately emotional, which means he's aggressive, uh, abusive. 
 Don't take it personally, okay? 
 Don't engage. 
 Just realize it's the tumor talking, okay? 
 Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, Dr. Grey and I want to say once again how grateful we are that you've decided to participate in our clinical trial. 
 I know it's a very hard decision to make. 
 But it is a chance, right? 
 It's, like, our only chance? 
 well, if the surgery doesn't k*ll me, the tumor will. 
 What have I got to lose, right? 
 well, as we discussed, the treatment has never been tested on humans before. 
 We're going to inject a live vus into the tumor. 
 And since we can't we take the tumor out, our hope is to reduce thtumor from within. 
 Dr. O'Malley. 
 Over the past month, Mr. Robinson has experienced worsening vision loss and increasingly severe headaches.

 Nice, huh?

 Admittedly, she could do with a little more on top.

 did last night, George? 
 I googled recipes. 
 I spent the night with a search engine. 
 Oh, but that was just ... it was so spontaneous. I ... think you'd want to hang out with interns. 
 Code. 
 Code. 
 what is that? 
 Oh, it's just something we came ... well, he came up with. 
 He coded. 
 you coded. 
 You coded. 
 It was really funny after seven or eight sh*ts. 
 you coded. 
 Um, so we're all set for tonight. 
 Tonight? 
 What's tonight? 
 the interns, we're ... we're just having a little darts tournament thing at joe's. 
 Oh, my god. I love darts. 
 Oh, do you wanna ... do you wanna come? 
 Yeah, absolutely. Yay. 
 ya so coded. 
 You know, I thought, I don't know, that it would be weird coming back, but I gotta say, I find it strangely comforting that everything is the same here. 
 Okay, in L. A. , People say things, but in Seattle, there's this strange culture of wordlessness wherein I am supposed to suss what one is feeling by the slight raise of an eyebrow or the beginnings of a frown. 
 There any chance you want to tell me what's going on with you, Miranda? 
 Just ... just a lot has changed since you left. 
 Just a lot. 
 Oh, come on. 
 Name one thing that has changed in this hospital. 
 The clinic is actually making money. 
 The chief's wife left him. 
 Derek and Meredith broke up and I ... J ... Derek and Meredith broke up? 
 Uh, like I said, a lot of things have changed. 
 Nikki jones, 25-year-old female, 35 weeks pregnant. 
 Six weeks ago, she was diagnosed with ectopia cordis. 
 which, as you know, means that your baby's heart is currently growing on the outside of his body. 
 Which doesn't get any less bizarre the more times I hear it. 
 Not bizarre, baby. 
 Just unique. 
 Our son is one of a kind ... wearing his heart on his sleeve. 
 This surgery is going to take place in two O.R. S. 
 It'll ... it will work like a dance. 
 Dr. Karev and I will begin with the delivery. 
 And I'll stay behind to close your incision, nikki. 
 While I bring your baby to O.R. Two. 
 Where I'll work on your baby's heart. 
 And I'll attend to your baby's intestinal problem. 
 What intestinal problem? 
 We've detected there might be a slight defect on your baby's diaphragm. 
 We just want to be prepared for every contingency. 
 I just wish I could keep him inside me, keep him protected. 
 he's protected no matter what, by us, by our love. 
 Something about that guy makes me just want to punch him out. 
 And yet you didn't, for which I amrateful, Karev. 
 hippies ... annoying, huh? 
 Go away. 
 How great is she? 
 She's great. 
 Did I tell you? 
 You told me. 
 Did she tell you? 
 Tell me what? 
 Anything, everything. 
 does she know you're divorced? 
 You're divorced? 
 Yeah. 
 Which, as it turns out ... was the best thing that could've happened, really. 
 no kidding? 
 Are you headed ... yeah. 
 All right, I'll walk with you. 
 Okay. 
 All right, well, you know ... so it seems like there's been a lot of change, even since the last checkup. 
 His behavior's been getting more erratic? 
 That's a nice way of putting it. 
 Well, you've been incredibly strong, Jennifer. 
 This is ... you've been incrediblytrong. 
 you know, if you really want to help, Dr. Grey, you could bring some single men by. 
 Phillip ... please stop. 
 Jennifer, we're in a hospital full of eligible doctors, and you're a waitress with no prospects who needs to learn how to use her ass to catch a new guy before I bite the dust! 
 It's just the tumor talking. 
 It's just the tumor talking. 
 It is. It's just the tumor talking. 
 and he's laughing again, because the idea of me with another man is just hilarious. 
 No, no, it's not. 
 I-I just can't see. 
 What? What can't you see? 
 I-I ... anything. 
 I'm blind. 
 No response to light. 
 If I remember correctly, you're a good-looking guy, right? 
 You know, just 'cause I'm blind doesn't mean you can ignore me, you sick, twisted bastard! 
 Playing games with people's lives, slicing open people's brains ... Mr. Robinson, I'm ... I'm sorry, but I believe it's possible the tumor is infiltrating the optic nerve. 
 We should consider moving the surgery, maybe even doing it today. 
 what about you, Dr. Grey? 
 You're a sexy little thing. 
 You think, uh, Dr. Shepherd here is attractive enough for my wife? 
 Jennifer ... this isn't easy, I know. 
 My husband is probably gonna die today. 
 We're moving up the surgery, and he might die, and all he can do is try to fix me up with other men. 
 And I know, I know it's the tumor talking, but if he dies, my last memory is going to be of him calling me a piece of ass. 
 I'm not involved and my hopes are not up. 
 I'm having trouble finding a heartbeat on an ultrasound. 
 That's what happens, Dr. Guzman, when you've had scotch for dinner. 
 It's hard to follow the basics. 
 Oh, rebecc hi. 
 Um, I really didn't want an ultrasound. 
 I just wanted to get something for the morning sickness. 
 It's really bad. 
 So y're pregnant? 
 Yeah. 
 Just like five weeks or so. 
 Uh, yeah, an ultrasound can be pretty hard to read this early on, so let's just take a blood sample, and, uh, make sure everything's on track. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Stevens ... do you know when Dr. Karev will be out of surgery? 
 I just wanted to say hi. 
 Um, I, uh, I-I don't know that he's gone in yet. 
 You broke up with Meredith Grey? 
 Well, we're doing a clinical trial together if that makes you feel better. 
 Derek, I hugged her ... hugged her ... and you're not even together with her anymore? 
 What the hell happened? 
 Okay, fine. 
 Tell me about the clinical trial. 
 Well, if it doesn't go well, I'm k*lling people f sport. 
 When I walk into an 
 O.R. , I'm an expert. 
 I can stop a bleed, I 
 can remove a clot. 
 I'm the expert. 
 But in a clinical triaL ... I'm experimenting, just groping around in the dark, hoping to do the right thing. 
 She wants greatness from me. 
 She's expecting greatness. 
 Okay, seriously, Derek, what are you doing? 
 I'm seeing somebody else. 
 She's lovely. 
 She's really lovely. 
 Hey. 
 You came. 
 Yeah. 
 Y-you have to stop paging me. 
 I can't deal with this right now. 
 All right? 
 I have a really big case today and I just can't deal with ... I am just as scared . 
 and confused about this as you are 
 I'm not scared. 
 I'm just ... look, y-you don't want me, okay? 
 This ... this is not a thing you want me for. 
 I won't be good at it. 
 I ... I'm ... I'm not father material. 
 I mean ... you have a husband. 
 He doesn't have to know that it's mine, okay? 
 No. No, it's not okay. 
 Alex, I'm just asking you to get over yourself for one minute and talk to me so we can figure this thing out ... together. 
 I have to go. 
 I'm gonna be making the incision from here to here, and ... excuse me. 
 What you said before about further complications ... no, we can't think like that. 
 There's nothing else wrong with him. 
 Our intention is to have a healthy baby. 
 He'll be strong and happy anhealthy. 
 Don't you understand what we're trying to tell you? 
 I mean, chances are your baby's gonna need a hell of a lot more than just heart surgery. 
 Dr. Karev. 
 Chances are he won't. 
 You can't cross your fingers or close your eyes and hope this will all go awaY. 
 Dr. Karev. 
 He's not prepared. 
 I was trying to prepare him. 
 They're having a baby, and that baby is gonna be all screwed up because he's coming into a world where his parents are unprepared. 
 They want to talk about loving each other, as if ... as if that has anything to do with having the ability to raise a baby ... a sick baby. 
 He's not prepared. 
 I was trying to prepare him. 
 Karev, right now you're feeling all your feelings right out in the open. 
 Do me a favor and stuff them back in. 
 Interesting advice. 
 Don't start with me. 
 she's no longer allowed in my apartment, so no more tea parties or wine parties or whatever you two have. 
 What? What are you talking about? 
 She's completely unfair and she refuses to teache. 
 Okay, I got in at mass gen, I got in at johns hopkins. 
 I could have gone anywhere, and she won't teach me! 
 All right, look, Erica ... she's a really good listener. 
 She's ... she comes off harsh at first ... But she's got a really good heart. 
 So just tell her how you feel, okay? 
 tell her how I feel? 
 Well, I don't speak girl. 
 Sorry about that. 
 Did I mention I live with Yang now? 
 What? Why are you looking at me like that? 
 Callie ... Are you speaking the ... vag*na monologues now? 
 What? 
 I'm all for it, okay? 
 I think it's fantastic. 
 Erica ... I mean, she seems great. 
 I really do like her, actually. 
 I do, and ... but are you? 
 you want to know if Erica and I are a-a-a couple? 
 Because I defended her to Yang? 
 Because you seem like a couple, a really happy couple. 
 okay, that's ... that's ... that's just ... that's ... that's insane is ... is ... is what it is. 
 I'm ... I-I-I 
 like penis. 
 I mean, I'a huge, huge fan of penis. 
 Hilarious. 
 You've been living in los angeles way too long. 
 way too long. 
 Hilari ... George. 
 George. 
 George. 
 Hey, listen. 
 I am just the messenger, but you should know that people are prepared to drop out of the tournament tonight. 
 Nobody wants to get drunk and play darts with their boss. 
 You want me to take back the invitation? 
 I'm just the messenger. 
 Y ... what's that about? 
 More special plans with your special friends? 
 I would like us to talk today. 
 I would like us to talk because ... I care and I, uh, want to know things and I-I-I have 15 minutes to hear about your feelings. 
 So ... Alex ... Alex, you look thoughtful. 
 I'm verynterested to hear ... I 
 mean, uh, what are your thoughts? 
 no. 
 Uh, Izzie, uh, your thoughts, your feelings? 
 Honestly? 
 I'm a little worried about my friend Alex here because his jane doe girlfriend keeps showing up like something out of ""fatal attraction. 
 ""Her name is rebecca pope, and she's not my girlfriend. 
 Really? You guys haven't ... had sex ... at all recently? 
 She's married, okay? 
 She has a husband. 
 Well, does it hurt that y ... she's married? 
 I mean, does that hurt your ... your heart? 
 What's the matter with you? 
 I'm tryingo talk girl. 
 Well ... ya coded. 
 right? 
 what? It's a new slang. 
 Everybody's saying it. 
 the way you just said that, that was you coding. 
 whatever. 
 Unlike Meredith with her trials and petri dishes, and Cristina, who has to practice talking like a human being ... I actually care abt patient care. 
 I need the sparkle pager. 
 She's not giving you the sparkle pager. 
 Well, you know what? I 
 can't talk girl. 
 And I shouldn't have to talk girl 
 'cause I diagnosed the patient. 
 I need the pager. 
 you can't have the sparkle pager. 
 No, give it to me. 
 Give it to me. 
 anyone, uh, anyone ever think you two were a-a couple? 
 No, because we screw boys like whores on tequila. 
 And then we either try to marry them or drown ourselves. 
 well, um, make Hahn let me scrub in, or I'm making you move out. 
 What? You ... desperate times. 
 I'm sorry that took so long. 
 Congratulations. 
 You're pregnant. 
 You're sure? 
 It's a big day for pregnant ladies. 
 Pregnant ladies everywhere I turn. 
 It's weird. 
 So I'm only supposed to give you a couple of these, but this is, like, a month's supply of prenatal vitamins ... samples, they're free. 
 No, I ... we need to schedule an abortion. 
 O-okay. 
 uh, I'm sorry. I ... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
 I-I don't mean to intrude, but ... you might want to sit with this for a few days before you make your decision. 
 There's no decision to make. 
 I'm H. I. V. 
 Positive, and the condom broke. 
 Oh, I-I got tested already, and, um, I will again s ... in, um, six months, but, uh, so far I'm fine. 
 So ... please I just ... I-I ... I want to get this over with. 
 Is there any chance that we can take care of it today? 
 Yeah. 
 Let me, uh ... let me see what I can set up. 
 Here. 
 All righT. 
 Torres. 
 Hey. 
 Uh, do me a ... do me a ... do me a favor and, uh, put Yang on your surgery. 
 Only if you buy drinks at joe's tonight. 
 Done. 
 Dr. Montgomery, will you do me a favor? 
 Can you talk to my patient? 
 I don't work here anymore, Stevens. 
 She's pregnant and H. I. V. 
 Positive, and she thinks she has to terminate the pregnancy. 
 She doesn't. 
 I know, but she doesn't, and it's not my area of expertise. 
 I don't work here anymore, Stevens. 
 If I worked here, I would be performing surgery after surgery after surgery. 
 I might even be back with, uh, my husband, who is apparently on the market, and I'm not saying that I want to get back with my husband. 
 It's just that things were simpler with him than the messy, messy single life I am currently living, which was not my point, by the way. 
 My point was ... that I no longer work here, which means you need to pull your face out of the potato chip trough and go tend to your patients yourself. 
 I know, but ... you're a fighter, Stevens. 
 What happened? 
 I lost a lot of fights. 
 Well, time to get backP. 
 Go. 
 Be the change you want to see in the world. 
 Did you just quote gandhi to me? 
 It's, uh, time to take her to the O.R. I'm not an idiot. 
 We heard you. 
 It could be bad, and there's always a whole lot of bad to focus on if you want to. 
 But there's hope, too, right? 
 There's always hope, too. 
 Jennifer? 
 No, it's Dr. Shepherd. 
 I hate this ... not being able to see. 
 I just want to see Jennifer. 
 Phillip, this is an extremely risky operation. 
 You still may have a few weeks to live. 
 You could spend that time with Jennifer. 
 You don't have to do this surgery today. 
 I'm trying to fix Jennifer up. 
 I don't want to leave her alone. 
 It's the one thing about all this I really can't stand. 
 I just want her to be all right when I'm gone. 
 You need to tell her that. 
 Before you go into surgery, you need to remember this conversation, and you need to tell her that. 
 I only have five minutes because we moved a surgery up. 
 But I did want tcome here and say that obviously, he doesn't know me at all. 
 I'm not the one who's emotionally involved. 
 He's the one who's emotionally involved. 
 He""""? "" 
 Derek ... told me not to get my hopes up. 
 Anybody who knows me knows I'm not a hopeful person to begin with. 
 Right. 
 I came up with this clinical trial. 
 It's my baby. 
 Does he honestly think that I've just walked into this thi with no understanding of how hard it will be? 
 Seriously. 
 No wonder we didn't work out. 
 Because he told you not to get your hopes up. 
 Exactly. 
 I gotta go. 
 Surgery's about to start. 
 The surgery with no hope? 
 Shut up. 
 so who's the new mystery woman that Derek's dating? 
 Who's the unlucky mcrebound? 
 what? 
 Oh, is the ... the whole 
 ""mc"" thing over now? 
 I mean, surely things haven't changed that much around here. 
 Addison, the woman standing immediately to your right, the one handing you the surgical instruments ... Six dates, heavy petting, lots of tongue ... good guy. 
 Scalpel? 
 we can have the baby? 
 You're saying we can have the baby ... a healthy baby. 
 With the proper prenatal treatment, the risks to your baby are substantially reduced. 
 I haven't found you an O. B. 
 Yet, and I think the process might prove really difficult ... it doesn't matter. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 We can figure anything out. 
 Uh, I can't believe this. 
 Thank you. 
 No. 
 No. 
 Do not thank her. 
 I asked you to do one thing. 
 I-I asked you to schedule an abortion. 
 Sarah ... no. 
 She just walks in here and gets your hopes up, and that's not okay. 
 I was diagnosed at 19, and I 
 have learned how to deal with it. 
 But I will not put that onto a baby. 
 I cannot bring a baby into this world who could possibly have this disease. 
 I won't. Now ... could you please just schedule the abortion? 
 And do me a favor. 
 Don't come back. 
 I'd like a different doctor. 
 whats up? 
 remember what we talked about? 
 Jennifer. 
 Jenn? 
 Jennifer! 
 I-I don't want to leave you alone. 
 I-I want you to meet someone. 
 I want you to promise me you'll try. 
 'Cause ... I can't ... I can't do this thinking I'm leaving you alone. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe I'll make it. 
 I-I hope I'll make it. 
 just a little bit further. 
 Good. Keep him flat. 
 The placenta looks good. 
 You okay to close, Dr. Bailey? 
 Yes. 
 Membrane's intact. 
 Oh, no. 
 She's hemorrhaging. 
 Oh, no. 
 This blood is coming a little bit too fast. 
 hey, I need another set of hands over here. 
 ******* 
 Where's montgomery? 
 The mom is in distress. 
 They're still trying to close. 
 Okay, get the baby to Hahn. 
 Addie knows what she's doing. 
 I think I've been hiding in the clinic. 
 Yeah? Okay. 
 Listen, Izzie ... I lost the contest. 
 I couldn't hack cardio. 
 I performed C. P. R. On a deer. 
 Izzie ... I think I've been hiding. 
 I ... you can't come play darts with us tonight. 
 What? 
 I-I shouldn't have to say this. 
 You should get this. 
 Get what? 
 You're ... you're not an intern anymore. 
 And, you know, I'm not a resident. 
 And that sucks, but I'm trying to make the best of it. 
 I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to stop complaining and embrace what I have. 
 And what I have is new friends who don't want to get drunk and play darts with their boss. 
 I'm their boss. 
 Yes. Yeah. 
 You're their boss. 
 You're in charge, and you should get that. 
 I gotta do something. 
 Get in here. 
 I thought I made myself clear. 
 You did. Iidn't. 
 Get in here. 
 Listen and learn. 
 I knew it. 
 You disapprove. 
 You're here to push some kind of agenda, right? 
 No. No. 
 Listen ... if you want to have an abortion because you want to have an abortion, then that's between you and whatever god you believe in. 
 But if you want to have an abortion because you think that's what medicine is telling you to do, then that's between you and me. 
 I was ineffectual. 
 I was unclear. 
 I've been on my heels a little bit lately, and I was unclear, so just listen, okay? 
 I wasn't telling you there is some chance your baby might not be born sick. 
 I was telling you there is a 98% chance your baby could be born perfectly healthy ... a 98% chance. 
 There's a higher chance of your baby being born with down syndrome than there is of you passing 
 H. I. V. On to your child. 
 I don't ... I just ... I-I can't ... I know you gave up on having children a long time ago, and I understand that it's difficult to readjust your thinking so quickly, but, sarah, if you take your meds responsibly, there's no reason why you can't have a beautiful, healthy baby. 
 This is your chance ... if you want it. 
 This is your chance to be a mom. 
 A 98% chance? 
 A 98% chance. 
 Thank you. 
 We are on the clock here, Dr. Karev. 
 We need montgomery now. 
 And she's coming. 
 She'll be here. 
 Heart rate's down to the 60s. He's bradychardic. 
 Damn it. We could lose him. 
 Tell me what to do. 
 massage the heart. 
 gently. 
 I can feel it getting stronger. 
 Heart rate's back up to the 140s. 
 I pushed 60cc of bolused N. S. **** 
 Good job, Karev. 
 You can step back now. 
 And now ... all right, the moment of truth. 
 Injecting the virus into the tumor. 
 All right, we're doing this one stage repair to prevent infection. 
 Ready for the skin graft. 
 complete heart block. 
 The injection went into the intra-arterial. 
 Okay, push one of atropine. 
 Not responding. 
 Push another one. 
 Oh, come on. 
 need another set of hands over here. 
 okay, there we go. 
 Okay, it's controlled right? 
 Yeah, it's controlled. 
 I got it. I got it. Go. 
 look at that ... beating inside his chest for the very first time. 
 And god admired his amazing skin flap ... and he saw that it was good. 
 How is he? 
 I was able to reduce the heart almost all the way into the pericardial space. 
 no intestines in there, no diaphragmatic hernia? 
 no anything. 
 His heart's in. It's beating. 
 patient number one ... treatment failed. 
 Call it, Dr. Grey. 
 Time of death ... 1933. 
 The parents were right. 
 The baby ... no further complications. 
 Good, good, and mom's okay, too. 
 You seem sad ... Miranda. 
 we're not gonna do this. 
 I can't share. 
 I can't catch up with you. 
 I can't talk. 
 'Cause if I did, if I 
 told you tucker moved out, if I told you I haven't slept alone in 12 years, if I told you that my heart hurt so much sometimes, I want to rip it from my chest with my own little hands ... I would fall apart. 
 And I don't have time to fall apart. 
 And not that I'm not happy to see you ... I am ... but I wish that you would go home so thehoice to talk and fall apart would go away. 
 i got my hopes up. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 Dr. Shepherd. 
 Yes. 
 It was a pleasure working with you today. 
 Dr. Grey. 
 I do miss some of this. 
 I could put the paperwork through tonight. 
 You could start work tomorrow. 
 I ... needed to come back ... to see that it was right to leave. 
 You need to fill my position. 
 I was gandhi, Dr. Montgomery. 
 I was so freakin' gandhi, I kicked gandhi's ass. 
 it's an L. A. Thing. 
 Aren't you gonna be late for your party? 
 I'm gonna blow 'em off. 
 I'd rather hang out with you anyway. 
 George, I get it. 
 I don't have to like it, but I get it. 
 So go. 
 Go ""code"" or whatever. 
 you know, whenever anyone, uh, says something really funny, and I'm laughing, I always look around to see if, uh, you think it's funny, too. 
 Even ... even when you're not there, I still look around. 
 Go. 
 I bet you wish you'd taken the stairs right about now. 
 giving birth may be all intense and magical and stuff, but the act itself? 
 It's not exactly pleasant. 
 but it's also a beginning ... of something incredible. . 
 I am. I am very, very funny. 
 You wouldn't believe what she ... you wouldn't believe what she ... wait, wait, wait. 
 Hang on, hang on ... that was some really funny ... You've got a hair that's caught ... caught in your lip gloss. 
 Something new ... sorry. 
 You were saying? 
 No, really, I'm just very funny. 
 Funny, hmm? 
 Yes, it turns out I am. 
 Apparently. 
 Yep. 
 Any of you ladies want to dance? 
 For the thousandth time, the answer is no, Mark. 
 Beat it, Sloan. 
 I'll dance with you. 
 Something unpredictable ... Dr. Montgomery. 
 Dr. Hahn. 
 Yang. 
 Yang? 
 Okay, is it ... is it 'cause I'm asian? 
 Is that your problem? 
 You don't like asian people? 
 Excuse me? 
 Why won't you teach me? 
 You're not without skill, you're not without talent ... so stop seeking my approval. 
 I am not gonna tell you what a good little girl you are. 
 It's not my job, and frankly, it doesn't make you any better at yours. 
 Jeez. 
 Little hard on her, don't you think? 
 I think she reminds me of me. 
 Something true ... she's pretty, huh? 
 She's betiful. 
 Something worth loving ... wanna get outta here? 
 Like you wouldn't believe. 
 Something worth missing ... Dr. Stevens, labs for rebecca pope. 
 Thanks very much. 
 No, this ... this can't be right. 
 Are you sure this is right? 
 hey, you leaving already? 
 I have a plane to catch. 
 I walk on the beach now, I buy aromatherapy candles, I'm very zen ... but I ... want to kick your ass so badly right now, it is k*lling me. 
 Excuse me? 
 I'm talking about Derek ... Derek christopher Shepherd. 
 Are you letting him get away? 
 Because I swear to god, Meredith, if you let him ride off into the sunset with that doe-eyed little thing ... of course I'm sure. 
 So my patient is not pregnant? 
 Apparently not.

 Was for christmas when I was 10 ... 
 My very first suture kit. 
 I used it until my fingers bled, And then I tried to use it to stitch up my fingers. 
 Thank you for meeting me. 
 You're the chief of surgery. If you page, I'm here. 
 It put me on the path to becoming a surgeon. 
 I want to say something. 
 I need to say something ... About what happened the other night. 
 I-I need you to know it wasn't ... Well, it isn't what you think. 
 Oh. I don't think anything 
 About your personal life, sir. 
 I had a problem ... a long time ago. 
 I was diagnosed with alcoholism. 
 Or I diagnosed myself. 
 And I didn't take a drink for almost 20 years. 
 But I think it was a misdiagnosis. 
 I'm not saying my drinking wasn't bad, because it was. 
 But there is such a thing as ... Situational depression. 
 And I think that's what i was suffering from, And it escalated my drinking. 
 Situational depression? 
 Your mother. Yes. 
 Well, she escalated my drinking, too, so ... Have you told anyone what you saw? 
 I mean, have you told Derek? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Well ... since I took a step back from surgery, I've had some time to really look at our residents. 
 And your work ... Is extraordinary. 
 A lot like your mother's. 
 And since I have some time ... Some extra time ... Maybe you would like a mentor. 
 Maybe I could teach you some things. 
 Have you ever done a 2-Layered, continuous suture 
 For an anastomosis? 
 My point is, sometimes the best gifts 
 Come in really surprising packages. 
 No. 
 Take a seat. 
 You're about to. 
 Wait. 
 Oh, it's teddy. Ah, I love it when it's teddy. 
 Okay. 
 Don't you think it's strange that he's mentoring you at night and still not talking to me? 
 Since the merger, it is impossible to get o. R. Time. 
 And who is responsible for that? 
 That's what I'm saying. I need all the help I can get. 
 And I am saying, he is using you to get to me. He is not. 
 Then why now? Why are you suddenly seeing so much of him? 
 I'm done talking about this. 
 If you want to stay mad, stay mad. 
 But I'm just gonna be here kissing you. 
 Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Wow. 
 That is the biggest pseudoaneurysm i've ever seen. 
 It's at the suture line of the transplant. 
 The new heart is dying. Damn it. 
 Poor guy that brought her in. 
 I think they were on their third date. 
 It doesn't even look like a heart anymore. 
 That's because it's not. 
 It's a chunk of useless flesh that has to come out right now. 
 You're taking the heart out? 
 What are you gonna replace it with? 
 I don't know. We're gonna have to figure it out as we go. 
 Okay, wait. Let me get this straight. 
 You removed her heart? Yes. 
 A-And she can live that way? 
 Like ... Like what, like a-A vampire? Usually you'd connect 
 A ventricular assist device to the heart, But since she doesn't have a heart ... Dr. Altman attached two, um, devices to her blood vessels. 
 Now this machine now pumps the blood through her body, Which is basically, um, a miracle. 
 I really like her. Uh, I like her a lot. 
 But we've only had four dates. 
 I'm supposed to have thanksgiving 
 With my family, you know? 
 She was gonna join us. 
 And now she's like a ... She can really live without a heart? 
 If you don't want to stay, we have a great nursing staff, Great doctors. 
 She'll be in good hands. 
 No. You know, she doesn't even have a family. 
 And if it was me, i would want somebody here. 
 So ... i'll stay. 
 Okay. 
 Tucker and little tuck are both fine. 
 Yeah, I know. 
 I'm sorry I have to work today and on christmas this year. 
 Yeah. Uh, tucker and i were hoping to bring him home 
 To visit you. 
 Mom, um, I have to go. 
 Happy thanksgiving, mom. 
 You didn't tell your parents about the divorce? 
 How long can you keep that a secret? 
 When you started dating women, How long did you keep that secret from your family? 
 Okay. Wh ... When did the bleeding start? 
 This morning. He's had these before. 
 I just ... i've never seen a nosebleed go on like this. 
 There's blood on timmy, mom. 
 Mr. And Mrs. Jacobsen, can I see you? 
 Go ahead. We'll be fine. 
 Nicholas has what is called an arteriovenous malformation. 
 It's a cluster of tangled blood vessels in his brain. 
 It's what's causing the bleeding. 
 In order to stop the bleeding, we need to remove it. 
 Y-Y-You mean like brain surgery or ... I'll do everything I can to protect the brain tissue and minimize damage. 
 I'm sorry. I know it's scary. 
 But we have to go in right away. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm looking for Dr. Mark Sloan. 
 Um, you see the dude who was burned ... Trying to deep fry a turkey? 
 Sloan's the guy making him scream like a girl. 
 Dr. Sloan? 
 Yeah. 
 Hi. 
 Um, so this is a little weird, But, um ... my name is Sloan reilly. 
 And, uh, my mom's samantha reilly. 
 And, uh, she told you my dad 
 Hi. 
 How's it, uh, how's it going in here? 
 Great. Fine. 
 Okay. 
 So have we broached the question of a paternity test? 
 'Cause I brought supplies. 
 She's 18. That's not very much younger than me. 
 Well, it's not that shocking actually. 
 I mean, the way Mark got around before he met you, There could be a gaggle of sloans. 
 Sloan jones. Sloan smith. Sloan Sloan. Mean. 
 Ah, damn it. 
 Son of a bitch. 
 I can't access the feeders. 
 So ... what does that mean? It means I can't get at it. 
 I can do a temporary fix, But once he starts bleeding again, which he will, There won't be anything we can do. 
 So we're just gonna ... send him home to die? 
 Happy thanksgiving, jacobsen family. 
 Nice day. 
 Little chilly. Hmm. Yeah. 
 It's brisk, though. It's not cold. 
 Right. 
 Look, teddy ... No. I ... I know. 
 I-I-I-I don't ... I don't understand. 
 You ... You said that ... That he would die without the surgery. 
 And now you're telling us we're supposed to just take him home? 
 Right. Well, i've stopped the bleeding temporarily. 
 But the only way to remove the a. V. M. Safely 
 Is through the sinus. Well, why don't you do that? 
 Because there are no instruments that can maneuver through 
 A nasal cavity this small and get the appropriate angles. 
 Why not? Who does that? 
 Who invents those things? 
 Mark ... Now might be a good place for you to say something. 
 Out loud. 
 Dude, are you, like, high or something? 
 Sloan. Yeah. 
 Yes 
 Mark, I need you on something. 
 I have a daughter, Derek. Yeah. 
 An 18-Year-Old daughter. 
 I am too young to have an 18 year old. 
 It's a nail in my coffin. It's like death has come to call. 
 Okay, can we put a pin 
 In your existential crisis for a minute? 
 No. That's why they call it a crisis. 
 Look, Dr. Robbins and i have a 6 year old 
 With an inoperable a. V. M. 
 We need your help to make it operable. 
 This is the best thanksgiving ever. 
 No obnoxious relatives. 
 No stupid traditions. 
 No going around the table and saying 
 What you're grateful for. 
 Yeah, I think we should do the opposite. 
 Talk about what we're not grateful for. 
 The merger. 
 The mercy westers. They're like the plague. 
 I mean, stealing all our surgeries, Eating all that pie in the nurses' station. 
 You're doing that wrong. I am not. 
 You are. Can I show you? 
 Private lessons with the chief ... Man, those daddy issues are working for you. 
 I don't have daddy issues. He's teaching me. 
 You're his bitch. Well, in that case, you're teddy's bitch. 
 Maybe that's my problem. I'm nobody's bitch. 
 Oh, well, you were Izzie's bitch. You're the bitch. 
 You know what? It's thanksgiving. Well ... Can we just have no name-Calling? Yeah. Please. 
 Whatever. Just show me that stitch again. 
 Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Hi. Hello. 
 Welcome. Happy thanksgiving. Who wants wine? 
 Ooh, I do. No, you ... You don't. 
 Um ... hey, everybody. 
 Uh, well, the results are in. 
 It, uh, turns out Sloan was right 
 About her parentage. 
 I am her dad. 
 Um, so here's another thing to be thankful for. 
 Lexie, Sloan here 
 Is gonna move in with us for a little while. 
 Oh, my god. Oh! 
 Now just ... Just ease up. 
 Let the suture do the work for you. 
 You know, it's like a dance. 
 You know, you let the needle be the man, Let it take the lead, And let your hand just follow. 
 Look at that. I haven't seen skill like that since ... Your mother. 
 That woman ... she could dance. 
 You should make up with Derek. 
 It's christmas. It's time. 
 You need to take perpendicular bites 
 About a millimeter apart. 
 How's it feel? 
 Still tingling? Oh, it's fine. 
 I pretty much have full sensation. 
 Great. Good. 
 So ... Have you, uh ... I mean, uh, you think you could ask her 
 How long she's planning to stay? 
 Mark, it's been a month, And you've exchanged three sentences with her. 
 Two of them were, ""pass the cereal."" 
 In the spirit of the holiday, Maybe you can ask her yourself. 
 She's pretty easy to like once you get to know her. 
 Really? 
 No. She's a vapid, vapid girl, But she's your daughter, okay? So ... So try. 
 Okay? Try ... Try to be her dad. 
 Go. 
 What are you looking at, you old perv? 
 Dad! 
 Merry christmas. 
 Uh, your mother sent me. 
 Uh-Oh. You heard. 
 Your cousin said something 
 To her husband in front of your niece, Who said something to your younger niece, Who said something to your mother. 
 I-I was planning to put a tree up, I just ... And where's tuck? 
 He's back east with tucker's family. 
 He was with me for thanksgiving. 
 So it's true. You are getting a divorce. 
 It's weird. 
 No heartbeat. 
 I used to climb mountains, you know? 
 One time I did the inca trail. 
 It's four mountains in three days. 
 The second day there's this climb. 
 It's eight hours straight. 
 And you are so tired, And the air is so thin, you don't even talk. 
 All you do is climb. 
 And it's just you and your breathing and your heartbeat pounding in your ears. 
 It's just hard getting used to no heartbeat. 
 And I'm getting tired. 
 Really tired. 
 I know. 
 You know what? You just need to hang on till new year's eve. 
 There's a lot of drunk drivers, a lot of brain death. 
 It's an organ-Palooza. 
 [ Chuckles ] 
 Kelsey, you just gotta hang on, okay? 
 You'll hike again, you know? 
 We'll hike together. 
 It's such a beautiful world outside of this hospital. 
 It's snowy and quiet ... cold ... And perfect. 
 So, you know, you just gotta make it until new year's eve. 
 I need to go outside. 
 What? What? 
 I might die. We all know that. 
 I might die really soon. 
 But snow is my favorite thing in the whole wide world. 
 It's my favorite thing. 
 Please. 
 Please, okay? 
 I'm sorry, but ... We can do that. 
 We can do that. 
 I want to bolt. I want to quit. 
 I want to ... go back to new york 
 Or I don't know ... Arkansas ... Somewhere no one can come looking for me. 
 I don't know how to talk to her. I ... And I don't know what she wants from me. 
 It's the guilt, you know? 
 It's like every time i look at her, it just ... The guilt is like a punch in the gut every day. 
 Well, you shouldn't feel guilty. You didn't know. 
 I did know. 
 I knew when her mom got pregnant. 
 She told me. 
 I gave her a couple hundred bucks and I left town, and I never saw her again. 
 You know, I figured she got an abortion. Hoped. 
 But I did know. 
 Well, you're a different guy now. 
 You're not 18 anymore. You've grown-Up. 
 You're capable of better. 
 Nicholas is back in the e. R. He's got a nosebleed, bad. 
 I've been trying to stop it for an hour. 
 We can't operate. We're not ready. 
 All right, well, then i'll admit him and keep transfusing 
 Until the equipment's done, which is gonna be soon, I hope? 
 Um, hello. Are you Bailey's ... Or I mean, Miranda's dad? 
 William Bailey. Uh, you can call me bill. 
 Okay. Hi, bill. 
 I'm callie Torres. I'm a-A friend of Bailey's. 
 She mentioned that she snuck you in here. 
 Said I should come say hi. 
 So what's that she's doing down there? 
 Oh, that's a hernia repair. 
 We get a lot of hernias at christmas. 
 Lots of people lifting trees or heavy gifts 
 Or santa bags. 
 It's ... Oh, we get a lot of broken bones, too, 'Cause of the weather. 
 Oh, I had this, uh, this guy earlier. 
 He got an electric shock from some christmas lights. 
 The shock was so big that it broke both of his wrists. 
 Yeah. Anyway, I'm dating women and ... Uh, I'm sorry? 
 Oh, I'm, uh ... i've recently started dating women. 
 And my family had a really hard time accepting that, But, you know, we worked through it. 
 And, um ... Bailey said that you're having 
 A hard time with her divorce, Which I totally understand. 
 But I ... I j ... I wanted to say that 
 She didn't come to that decision lightly. 
 And she's a good person, and ... Merry christmas. 
 Did hunt ever tell you about the time 
 That he made snow? No. 
 His guys were feeling the holidays pretty bad, So hunt orders one of those snow makers on christmas eve. 
 He tries to get the thing going, But the minute that the snow hit the sand, it melts. 
 So hunt blindfolded his guys and made them put their faces 
 Right up to the snowblower. 
 There was this one kid from minnesota. 
 He actually cried. 
 He said it felt exactly like christmas at home. 
 Huh. 
 Ooh, hunt. 
 Hunt's so delicious when he's tending to bloody soldiers. 
 Love me some hunt. 
 Shut up. What are you ... So how was the view? 
 I have been a proud father. 
 Your whole life, i have been a proud father. 
 Your mother and i sat in the front row 
 Of every dance class, every oboe recital, And we cheered. 
 We sat in the front row of every graduation. 
 I was always the first one on my feet and the loudest one in the crowd. 
 I have been ... a proud father. 
 And today, Miranda, i-I s-Sat in the gallery, And I watched you repair some fat man's hernia. 
 And for the first time in my life, I felt ashamed of you. 
 This is what you do on christmas? 
 For this, you traded your husband? 
 For this, you traded your child's family? 
 So you could work all day and go home alone on christmas 
 To an empty house without even a tree. 
 I have been a proud father ... Miranda. 
 But I would be a bad father today 
 If I didn't look you in the eye and tell you that you have made a terrible mistake. 
 You broke your family. 
 You set your son up to fail. 
 And the child I raised ... Huh, she was raised better than that. 
 Well, that's something you don't see every day. 
 She could code. The monitor could short out. 
 Teddy's a brilliant surgeon, But i-I don't get how she made this call. 
 I get it. It's patient care. 
 And teddy's always been a sucker for christmas. 
 Oh, my god. Kelsey! 
 From your x-Rays and c. T. , It looks like part of your bowel has died. 
 It ... It's a side effect of your poor circulation. 
 It's why you collapsed. 
 But just ... fix her, okay? 
 She can't have come this far to ... Just fix her. 
 We're gonna need to repair this as soon as possible. 
 The more time we wait, the more bowel dies. Yeah, but how? 
 She's septic, hypotensive, and she has no heart. 
 Teddy: her pressure's too low for general anesthesia. 
 She won't survive. 
 Then ... we won't put her under general. 
 Andthis goes through the nose to the base of the skull, And then I drill the bone off. 
 Well, what happens once you drill the holes? 
 We put miniature staple clips 
 On the vessels. With what instrument? 
 We don't have it. Not yet. But we will. We will. 
 We're, uh, still trying to figure out how to build it, But we're on it. 
 Uh ... I would like 
 An invitation to your home for christmas dinner. 
 I know it's very late for me 
 To be asking for such an invitation, Given that it is, in fact, christmas day. 
 However, I have a very worried father, And if I don't look like i have some sort of life, He'll never leave. 
 I have a bowel infarction to repair, and then after that, I'll be free to come to your home. Sounds fine. 
 Oh, absolutely. Thank you. 
 The chief just cut off the funding for our equipment. What? 
 What? We're way over budget, And nicholas is running out of time. 
 We want our bonuses to go towardssorry. For nicholas jacobsen. 
 Sorry, you can't do that. 
 No, but it'll be like a donation. They're our bonuses. 
 There are no bonuses. That's what he's trying to say. 
 There are no bonuses this year. I'm sorry. 
 Merry christmas. 
 I'll write a check. How much? 
 I'll split it with you. Thank you. 
 I have a teenager. What if she wants to go to college? Have you met her? 
 Fine, I'm in. 
 Thank you. I'll get back to you with numbers. Uh, shep. 
 Chief. 
 I'm sorry i tried to fire you. 
 And in the spirit of the holidays, I was, uh ... Sorry. 
 * I really can't stay * 
 * but, baby, it's cold outside * 
 * i've got to go 'way * 
 * but, baby, it's cold outside * 
 * this evening has been *

 You're not serious. You got him a snow globe of Seattle? 
 What? He likes Seattle. 
 I gave you 50 bucks. Where's my change? 
 Mark ... your kids are bickering. 
 Have you talked to her yet? 
 I'm workin' on it. 
 Your sister's got a ready-Made family there. 
 Well, don't worry. She didn't forget about you. 
 She invited you, right? 
 He's drinking ... isn't he? 
 Richard. 
 He's off the wagon. 
 Well, he's drinking eggnog. It's christmas. 
 Everybody drinks eggnog at christmas. 
 Mm, some people do. Recovering alcoholics don't. 
 He's not an alcoholic. 
 That was a misdiagnosis. 
 Is that what he's telling you? 
 Meredith, he is a surgeon and he is drinking, And he is an alcoholic. 
 That could quickly become catastrophic. 
 Were you drinking when I was a kid, When you left me with my mother and got another family and never looked back? 
 No. 
 No, I didn't start drinking till much later. 
 Well, then we can't blame the world's evils 
 On alcohol, can we? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 It hurts. I know. 
 Surgery with only a local anesthetic is not ideal. 
 Hang in there. 
 Okay, okay. 
 It's gonna be okay. 
 I'm here with you, all right? 
 Hey, hey. Hey, no tears. No tears at christmas. 
 No, there's only, uh, Lights and, um, snowmen ... And songs. 
 Um ... * oh, the weather outside is frightful * 
 * but the fire is so delightful * 
 Come on now. 
 * but since we've no place to go * 
 Karev. 
 No, thanks. 
 Sing, Yang. Oh, no. I don't um, I'm jewish. 
 Hey, don't play the race card with me. 
 Sing or get off my service. 
 * let it snow, let it snow, let it snow * 
 * it doesn't show signs of stopping * 
 * and i've brought some corn for popping * 
 You, too, Karev. 
 * the lights are turned way down low * 
 * let it snow, let it snow, let it snow * 
 The house looks beautiful, mer. Thank you. 
 Callie? 
 Working. Oh, that's too bad. 
 Here, you want some stuffing? Thanks. 
 That's all, thank you. Oh, how ... How'd kelsey do? 
 Uh, well. Who's kelsey? 
 A girl with no heart. 
 I had to do a laparoscopic bowel repair 
 While the poor thing was awake on the table. 
 Miranda, mind your manners. 
 Even if surgery is your whole life, it doesn't mean 
 You have to talk about bowels at the dinner table. 
 My child is healthy. 
 Excuse me? 
 He may not be with me tonight, but he's healthy ... I didn't say he ... And he's well-Loved. He's a well-Loved boy. 
 And he's a happy boy. 
 And staying in an unhappy marriage ... Now is not the time or the place ... Staying in an unhappy marriage, a marriage that i've outgrown, A marriage full of ultimatums and numbness and resentment ... Miranda ... That is not the kind of life 
 I want to model for my child. 
 That is not what i want him to believe 
 Married love is. 
 Look, I know what's possible. 
 I know what's out there for me 
 Because you taught me well. 
 You and mom showed me what true love looks like. 
 So I chose not to settle, and I'm happier for it, Even if I'm alone at christmas. 
 My child is healthy, and I'm happy. 
 And, you know, part of my happiness is 
 The fact that I got to repair a woman's bowel and save her life today. 
 And that's god's work, Which makes this appropriate christmas dinner conversation. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm happy. 
 And my child is healthy. 
 And that's enough for me today, dad. 
 That's enough. 
 Uh, green beans, anyone? 
 Thank you. 
 Thanks. 
 Okay. 
 Here I would advise a one-Hand tie. 
 Um, okay. Uh, why don't I talk and you operate? Good. 
 Last night was my last drink. 
 The shaking will stop soon. Good. Good for you. 
 That doesn't mean I have to quit drinking tequila, does it? 
 'Cause I really like tequila. 
 It's new year's eve. 
 I know. 
 She shows no signs of leaving ... No suitcase packed, nothing. 
 Talk to her right now, or no more sex for you. 
 So ... What you reading? 
 I can tell you don't really like me, And, um, your girlfriend's, like, totally freaked out by me 
 'Cause I'm kinda, like, hotter than her. 
 But I'm pregnant. Yeah. 
 I'm having a baby, and, um, That's why i dropped out of school and that's why my mom kicked me out. 
 Look ... I know you don't owe me anything ... But I can tell you guys are about to kick me out ... And I ... I ... I don't have anywhere else to go. 
 Shh. Shh. 
 It's okay. 
 You're gonna be okay. 
 He's in hypovolemic shock. He's lost too much blood. 
 And I didn't want to have to do this, but we're gonna 
 Have to put a tube down his throat to help him breathe. Nicholas. 
 We need to tube him right now. Don't tube him. Bag him till we get to the o. R. 
 The o. R. ? We finished the instruments. 
 We did? Yeah, we're gonna operate. 
 I just need you to sign a consent form. 
 Pretty dramatic timing, Dr. Shepherd. 
 I like to make an entrance. It's okay. 
 Her kidneys are shutting down. 
 We need to find a donor. We needed to find one yesterday. 
 It's new year's eve, Dr. Yang. 
 You said I just had to make it to new year's eve. 
 Drunks all over the roads. So yeah. 
 Tonight's are best shot. 
 Oh, how's it handling? 
 It could bend a little more gently. 
 Don't get all critical. Thing cost me a fortune. 
 I could use one more day to practice. Okay. 
 Inserting the clip applier. 
 Why don't you try torquing it a little 
 To get a different angle? 
 There you go. 
 Okay. There it is. 
 Perfect. 
 Okay. 
 Got it. That's the last clip. 
 Oh, my god! Ladies and gentlemen, we're done here. 
 Nice work. Beautiful. Oh, my god. You did it. 
 Amazing. 
 Hang on. Look at the clock. 
 And that's, uh, seven, six ... Five, four ... Three, two, one. 
 Happy new year! 
 Happy new year. 
 Happy new year. Happy new year. 
 I'm just gonna take a listen. 
 It looks like we're hitting the final wave. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 Yeah, well, I'm headed to the ... What is wrong with you? 
 You. Me? 
 Yeah, you. You come over here ... Why did you tell me this now? Why do you even care? 
 You didn't say a thing ... All those times, all those years ... So why now? I don't know. 
 You don't know? 
 I don't know. I don't know. What does it matter to you? 
 You never felt the same way for ... Of course I did! 
 Of course I did. I had all those feelings 
 For you, teddy, for years, But you never gave me anything. 
 You were engaged. 
 You never gave ... For years ... you were engaged. You were engaged, you idiot! 
 You never gave me one damn hint! You idiot. 
 I have loved you forever. 
 I have loved you when I was coupled up. 
 I have loved you when I was single. 
 I have loved you every second of every day. 
 Teddy ... I love you. I'm in love with you. 
 I'm in love with Cristina. 
 You paged me? 
 Uh, I just confirmed, uh, brain death 
 On an 18-Year-Old female 
 Involved in a head-On m. V. C. Earlier this evening. 
 She's a match for kelsey. So I called n. O. S. , And they gave me the go-Ahead for a directed donation. 
 Now Dr. Bailey will do the organ recovery, And I set up o. R. Two for kelsey. 
 That is why new year's eve is my favorite holiday. Stop it. 
 This is not a celebration. Come here. 
 No. 
 No, no, no, not my baby. 
 Please not my daughter. Oh, my ... I can't ... This is not a celebration. 
 No, no, no, you can't ... Oh, no. 
 Your kidney's have stabilized, And your vitals are stable, and ... Everything looks great. 
 Feel. 
 Awesome, huh? 
 Um, I can only really feel your boob, so ... hey! 
 You want to feel? Uh, no. But I will listen. 
 Oh, my god. What are you doing? Oh, my god. What are you doing? 
 I know it's only been a couple of months. 
 And four dates. It's technically been four dates. 
 You amaze me ... every day. 
 And we went through a w*r together. 
 We went through this together, and we came out the other side. 
 And I think ... If we can get through this, we can get through anything. 
 So marry me. Please. 
 Yes. 
 Of course. 
 I'm ... Insensitive sometimes. 
 But I'm not oblivious. 
 And I don't want you to, uh, to be with me 
 Because you feel like you owe me something because ... I mean, you two went through w*r to ... I with you. 
 I'm with you because I want to be. 
 I'm with you because I love you. 
 Are you sure? 
 Every day, we get to give the gift of life. 
 It cane painful, it can be terrifying ... 
 But in the end, it's worth it ... 
 Every time. 
 We all have the opportunity to give. 
 Maybe the gifts are not as dramatic 
 As what happens in the operating room. 
 Uh ... so how was new year's eve at tucker's? 
 Oh, it was fine. 
 I kissed my grandson at midnight east coast time, And I tucked him into bed. 
 Okay. Uh, so you're headed home today? 
 Mom's picking you up at the airport? 
 Yeah. 
 I, uh ... Tucked you in every night of your childhood. 
 Dad ... i tucked you in and I kissed you goodnight and I checked under the bed for bad guys. 
 And you went and grew up and got yourself a divorce ... And didn't bother to tell me. 
 I-I didn't know how to ... explain. 
 I didn't want to disappoint you. 
 I-I didn't want to be judged. 
 I'm your father. 
 Can you imagine if little tuck grew up and got a divorce and didn't tell you? 
 Then I'm sorry, dad. 
 I'm ... I'm so sorry. 
 Maybe the gift is to try and make a simple apology. 
 I'm ... never judging you. 
 I'm worrying about you. 
 Your mother and i worry about you. 
 That's all. 
 Little tuck, He's a real spitfire, isn't he? 
 He is. 
 He sure is. 
 He doesn't seem too much worse for wear. 
 Maybe it's to understand another person's point of view. 
 Hi. I'm sorry that I paged you. 
 He's pretty public here, And I know what that could do, you know, to his career. 
 I-I didn't know what else to do. 
 Maybe it's to hold a secret for a friend. 
 The joy, supposedly, is in the giving. 
 Meredith. 
 Happy new year. 
 She is my star pupil, joe. 
 My little star. 
 And I'm so proud of her. 
 I am svery proud. 
 She will be a brilliant surgeon ... 
 Brilliant ... 
 Just like her mother. 
 So when the joy is gone ... 
 Get Dr. Grey a drink, joe. Tequila. 
 When the giving starts to feel more like a burden ... 
 That's when you stop. 
 And, um ... I will ... I'll have another club soda. 
 But if you're like most people I know ... 
 And it's on me ... On me. 
 You give till it hurts ... 
 And then you give some more.","[""a couple hundred bucks and I left town, and I never saw her again. \n You know, I figured she got an abortion. Hoped. \n But I did know. \n Well, you're a different guy now. \n You're not 18 anymore. You've grown""]",True

 ‚ô™ Easy to find, you see ‚ô™ 
 But you can't plan a baby room before you have a baby. 
 I mean, that ... you're gonna jinx the adoption. 
 No, the social worker wants to see where we live. 
 This is like a death trap. 
 I'm trying to create a reasonable distraction. - Oh. 
 Hello. Janet, welcome. 
 How are you? Thanks for coming out. 
 Oh, be careful. Watch those nails.

 ‚ô™ You leave behind the weight of the future ‚ô™ 
 I'm gonna stop in the lab. 
 I'll see you after the intake, okay? 
 Okay. Oh, God. I forgot it was the Hobarts today. 
 It always bums me out when we have an Alzheimer's patient with young kids. Well, there's no shame in sitting this one out. 
 I can do the intake. Stop treating me like I'm your wife. 
 On the trial, I'm a colleague. 
 I'm allowed to say it bums me out. 
 Doesn't mean you have to feed me warm milk and run a bath. 
 Treat me like a doctor. Right. 
 Sorry. Okay. Go do the intake, colleague. 
 Shepherd, you got a minute? 
 I need to talk to you about your trial. 
 Oh, um ... well, I should get Meredith. 
 I just got a lecture on the failure to extend professional courtesy to one's spouse. 
 I think it's best you don't get Meredith. 
 You're in ... in very good hands. 
 I still feel bad that I'm not gonna be here. 
 For the surgery? I'll be unconscious. 
 That's not when I'm gonna miss you. 
 Okay. Then I guess I w ... You can feel bad about all the time that follows. 
 You know, when I'm not under general anesthesia, and you're still not here. 
 You're halfway around the world ... With Arnold. 
 Andrew. Raah! 
 Excuse me? He's a rock star. 
 I kind of feel like the sound of an adoring crowd should follow his name. 
 I don't ... I don't ... Is that a compliment or an insult? I don't know. I guess it depends on how you feel about rock stars. 
 Okay, well, Andrew is not a rock st ... Raah! - Okay, you know what? Can you stop that, please? 
 It's starting to get annoying. 
 My wife's leaving. I'm allowed to be annoying. 
 I'm not a real wife, so that doesn't buy for a lot of bad behavior. 
 Well, you're my real best friend. What does that get me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Don't be. Go be happy ... with Andrew. Raah! 
 You're impossible. 
 Yeah, you, too. 
 Meredith, tell me exactly what you did. 
 I can't tell you. 
 We can still fix this, but I need to know what you did. 
 If I tell you, it'll make it worse. 
 It's worse already. Meredith ... Listen, I-I ... I love you. 
 And I'm sorry. 
 But I can't tell you anything. 
 You wanted to be treated like a colleague? 
 I'm gonna treat you like a colleague. 
 Alex Karev informed Dr. Hunt that Dr. Grey tampered with my clinical trial. 
 She switched around the placebos and the dr*gs, probably invalidating ... my trial. 
 Is this true? 
 Nothing I did has any effect ... Tell me exactly what happened. 
 I can't do that. Do you have any idea what you've done? 
 You think the F. D. A. will get anywhere near this hospital ever again? 
 Meredith, look at me. 
 If this is wrong, if there is something going on, if Karev is exaggerating, this is the part where you have to tell me. 
 This is the part where you have to deny the charges. 
 Kick me off the study. 
 There's nothing wrong with the study. 
 Nothing I did changes anything. 
 But you're not denying it? 
 I'm gonna have to investigate what's going on here, but it looks to me like you just lost your job. 
 So they're probably gonna fire me. 
 Are you happy? Oh, come on. They're not gonna ... I want your crap out of my house by the end of the day. 
 What the hell was that? 
 A 757 went down in the sound. 
 We're looking at about 
 200 injured passengers. 
 We're the designated crisis center. 
 Families will be instructed to come here to find their loved ones. 
 We are activating surge protocol. 
 Dr. Hunt is gonna be running the show. 
 It's gonna be chaotic. You need to listen carefully. 
 You need to stay focused. Do not contribute to the panic. 
 Now get to your stations. 
 Dr. Bailey, let's clear any beds that we can. 
 Discharge or transfer. Okay, uh, Grey. 
 All right, Torres, you'll be with me. 
 Kepner, set up the E. R. for triage. 
 Other Grey, I want you running the family center. 
 Take over in the cafeteria. Yang, blood bank. 
 Uh, we might need a Candyman. Dr. Sloan will be our Candyman. 
 Let's be liberal with pain meds for our victims and sedatives for patients that we are moving. 
 Uh, Avery, you can help him out. Let's move, people. 
 What happened with Meredith? Cristina, I can't ... Owen. She tampered with Shepherd's study. 
 Invalidated the results. She destroyed the whole thing. 
 There was a plane crash. They're gonna cancel your procedure and try to send you home. 
 You need to tell them that you are a D-1. 
 You don't need to be in pre-op, but that you want to be moved to a regular room. 
 That way, when the hospital starts doing surgery again, you'll be first in the queue. Don't you have a plane ... Wait. Did they shut down the airport? 
 No, but we're not leaving till it's over. 
 They need surgeons and trauma counselors. 
 These are your films. They're gonna schedule your surgery at Seattle Presbyterian. 
 Seattle Pres can't take anymore. Start calling County. Avery! 
 Why'd you give me that guy in the middle of a mass trauma? 
 Avery? The kid quit Webber's study. What kind of idiot decides working with the chief of surgery is too taxing on his schedule? 
 He didn't quit because he thinks it's too much hard work. 
 He quit because he thinks the chief has a shot at a Harper Avery, and he was worried that if his name was on it, it would k*ll Webber's chances. 
 Kepner, discharges. Yeah. 
 You know, she's the only one who ever gave a rat's ass about you, and now you might have destroyed her career. 
 You should find some skanky intern to love you, 'cause next time you're in a burning building, no one is handing you a glass of water. 
 Please make sure you give us a cell phone number ... Matthew Ruiz? Do you have ... No one from the flight has arrived yet. 
 As soon as we get any infor ... Do you have a list of people they're bringing to the hospital? Because we ... Folks, it can take emergency services quite a long time to move and identify people in a situation like this. 
 Please just try to be patient ... Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry. Look, my wife was on the plane. 
 Can you please just tell me ... Sir, at this point, we don't have any information. 
 Please just sign the sheets. 
 I'd like to speak to your supervisor. 
 Somebody that knows what's going on. 
 Ma'am, my supervisor doesn't have any information. 
 Nobody has any information. Please just sign the sheet. 
 Dr. Hunt, I had way too many drinks before I told you that. 
 I-I didn't mean for ... Not now, Karev. 
 Look, I told you that because 
 I didn't think she should be chief resident, not that she should be fired. If you didn't think this through, then you are as dumb as she is. 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 Yeah. I'm fine. 
 Uh ... the plane was from Baltimore, where my parents live. 
 I've taken that flight, um ... with my son. 
 You want to come sit down with me for a minute? 
 No, no, no. I can't, uh ... There's too much, uh ... Okay. Um ... I'm just gonna ... I'm just gonna stand here for a minute. 
 Is that all right? 
 Are you on any medications? No. 
 Ever given blood before? 
 Nope. 
 Any chance you're pregnant? 
 Mm ... I don't know. 
 When was your last period? Not sure. 
 Uh, what were you doing, um, last time you had to deal with tampons? 
 Like maybe it was St. Patrick's Day, and you ate, uh, four green doughnuts and thought, wow, that's disgusting. 
 I must be hormonal. Oh, my gosh! 
 You're right! Except it was these gross cookies with green frosting. 
 But that was a while ago. 
 Uh, I guess I had mine again around Easter ... 'Cause I was all over the marshmallow peeps. 
 It totally works. 
 Hey. W-what the hell? 
 It looks about 6 weeks to me. 
 I take it this wasn't deliberate. 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 You want to talk about options? 
 No. 
 Officials say it's too early to speculate on the cause of the crash. 
 But here's what we do know ... The flight originated this morning in Baltimore carrying 183 passengers and 18 crew members ... Still nobody? Oh, their families are going crazy. 
 What is taking so long? 
 Well, fishing 200 people out of the water is slow business. 
 You want to play ""Angry Birds""? 
 They'll do triage at the waterfront. 
 It takes time. Actually, if they're taking this long, there's gonna be a lot of hypothermia. Kepner. Oh, yeah. 
 Warm blankets, heated lamps, and heated I. V. fluids. - Got it. 
 You post chief resident yet? Uh, no. Not yet. 
 What's the holdup? 
 The suspense ain't k*lling me. It's gonna be Grey. 
 Well, I thought Karev made a great play for it. 
 A plane full of orphans ... That's pretty impressive. Ah, he's already decided. 
 You don't have to lobby for your boy. Karev. 
 I want a written account of exactly what you saw, every detail ... when, where ... Oh, look, sir, I-I don't think that's ... I-I don't want to know what you think. Okay? 
 Need more sedatives. 
 The people we're transferring are starting to freak out. 
 ‚ô™ When I was lost and looking down ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ and turned it all ‚ô™ 
 You're a good man, Avery. 
 ‚ô™ With your light ‚ô™ 
 Lexie's yours. 
 Take her. Take care of her. 
 I'll stay out of your way. 
 I kind of already have her, but ... Thank you? 
 You're welcome. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 You know, I think I'm gonna order pizza. 
 If you want, I can get ... I'm pregnant. 
 Cristina ... I cannot believe this is happening. 
 I know. I know it's complicated. 
 I know it wasn't supposed to happen like this, but ... Cristina, this could be something ... What? No. 
 There's no way we're doing this. Do you hear me? Cristina ... No, no. I-I am not this uh, uh, beautiful vessel for all that might be good about the future. 
 I'm not carrying your hopes and dreams. No. I get to talk. 
 I'm here. There's two of us. We are a partnership. 
 Can we just ... just think together? Is that okay? 
 I know who you are. I know what you want. 
 I love you. 
 I don't love the incubating potential of your womb. 
 I love you. 
 Why would I want to do something that would make you miserable? 
 Do you think I love you more when you're miserable? 
 Do you think I-I-I want that, you running off to Meredith? 
 You think I'm looking for more of that? 
 But ... I think there's a way ... No, no! I-I still get to talk. 
 There is a way to make this work without it ruining your life or derailing your career. 
 I don't want a baby. 
 Well, you have one. 
 Are ... Are you getting all life-y on me? 
 How late are you? 
 That does not matter. 
 Of course it matters. 
 Okay, fine. You tell me when life begins. 
 You know, I can't ... I can't wait to hear this one. 
 I don't know. Does it ... does it have hands? 
 I cannot believe you are doing this. 
 I'm just asking a question. 
 I don't want one. 
 I don't hate children. I respect children. 
 I think they should have parents who want them. 
 I want them. 
 I want them, and maybe you could to. 
 I believe ... Your life can be bigger than you think it is. 
 I know you can contain more than you think you can. 
 I'm not saying we do this. I am just saying, let's think. 
 Let's see what kind of life we can imagine. 
 Cristina Yang ... I imagine such a huge life for us. 
 This is an extremely serious accusation, Meredith. 
 Can't you tell me anything? 
 I-I-I-I can't. I-I'm sorry. 
 Talk to me. 
 How many patients are we talking about here? 
 Did this happen more than once? 
 I can't say that either. 
 She can't say anything. 
 We're gonna unwind this, Meredith. 
 Karev is figuring out what cases he was on when he saw you, he'll narrow down the dates, we'll know which patients ... Nothing I did changed the trial. 
 Uh, fire me. Do whatever you have to do. 
 Look, you don't get to choose, okay? 
 You don't get to decide who gets the drug or the placebo. 
 You don't get to decide what information the trial gets. 
 Anything I tell you affects the trial. 
 If you don't know what I did, the trial stays blind. 
 The trial is over. You screwed me. 
 You screwed this hospital. And you screwed yourself. 
 This is your disease we're trying to cure. 
 Or Lou Gehrig's disease, but I did this for you. 
 Derek, it was Adele. 
 Uh, maybe I should put some I. V. fluids in the heater warm them up? - No. 
 But if people have been in the water for that long ... April ... But if we just ... No one's coming. 
 If it's taking this long, nobody survived. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I don't know. 
 Well, the protocol is fairly clear. 
 Are you encouraging him to fire me? 
 Look, Derek, I basically pressured her to do it. - Mm. 
 You'd have to fire us both. 
 I'm gonna have to suspend you so it doesn't look so bad. 
 The study ... I need to turn the whole mess over to the F. D. A. , let them figure out what to do with it. 
 I mean, I-I can't. I just ... Meredith ... I don't know how to ... I know. 
 Emergency services has begun identifying bodies. 
 They've given us a list. 
 The airline reps are on their way. 
 We've got social workers here and more coming. 
 It's a long list. Each of you have families to inform. 
 So, uh, please be outside the cafeteria in exactly one hour. 
 You'll call one family at a time. 
 And you'll be assigned a room to take them to and deliver the news. 
 It's gonna be a-a long day. 
 That's it. 
 Dr. Hunt, you gave chief resident to Kepner? 
 It was supposed to be me or Grey. 
 Do you think anyone's gonna listen to Kepner? 
 It's gonna be complete chaos. 
 You think anyone's gonna listen to you? 
 You just sold out the one universally liked individual at this hospital. Everyone is gonna hate you. 
 A chief resident's supposed to manage their peers, be a resource and a support. After what you did, do you think anyone is gonna come to you for anything? 
 I was planning to give it to you. 
 And now? 
 So it's possible that we'll never ... That we just ... We just won't get the treatment? 
 It's a possibility, yes. 
 Oh, my God. This isn't right. 
 We're so close. 
 He needs this. Can you just ... Is it k*lling people? 
 No. So give it to him anyway. 
 I wish we could. No. Don't give me that. 
 You can and you're choosing not to. Audrey ... No. They say there's nothing they can do. 
 There's a drug in a box in this hospital, and you were on the schedule. 
 My children's father is disappearing. 
 Give him the damn drug! 
 I could take a leave for six months or a year. 
 No, you couldn't. 
 Yes, I ... Sure, I could. They're not gonna fire me. No. 
 Stop saying no. I'm telling you, I want this. 
 I can do this. 
 This does not have to be your problem. 
 It'll be my problem. You wouldn't even ... What, notice? It'll be a baby. 
 I'm not a monster. If I have a baby, I'll ... I'll love it. 
 That's the problem. 
 That you'll love it. 
 That ... that's a problem that we can work with. 
 I'm sorry. Are you laughing right now? 
 No, no. I'm just ... I'm not ... I just ... I love you. 
 What is so ... Are you even listening to me? 
 Yes. I'm just trying to figure out some kind of a compromise. 
 Okay, but you know what? There is no compromise. 
 You don't have half a baby. 
 I don't want one. 
 Okay, I-it isn't about work. 
 This isn't a scheduling conflict. 
 I don't want to be a mother. 
 Cristina, do you love me? 
 Of course I do. 
 Do you trust me? 
 I ... y-yes. 
 You'd be a great mother. You would. 
 I-I know you don't believe me, but it is true. 
 Just sit with this for a little while, this terrible idea that you might love a baby. 
 Just for me, sit with it ... Did you even hear ... I mean, okay. Why would I do that? 
 Because you love me. You love me. 
 That's why. 
 I have three names. 
 I don't think I can do this three times. 
 One foot in front of the other. 
 Oh, I've got something that'll cheer you up. 
 Sloan gave us his blessing. 
 Well, that's not really right. 
 More like he gave you to me, which was nice. 
 Are you serious? 
 Yep. Though I probably owe him a goat. 
 Okay. 
 All right. Let's do it. 
 Is the Schoman family here ... Jessica and Maxwell? 
 Jason Schoman. He's our son. 
 I'm Dr. Altman. Will you follow me, please? 
 They think it's good news. 
 Elaine Chen. 
 Ma'am, I'm Dr. Sloan. Why don't you come with me? 
 Uh, Gilda and Miguel Ruiz? 
 This is a nightmare. 
 Hi, I'm Dr. Bailey. Come with me, please. 
 I brought some pudding. 
 That's why you're here? 
 I've got a good nurse. She'll hook me up with pudding. 
 I know. It's just ... Oh, I just spent the last two hours telling people that their family members were dead, and I needed to ... Well, I just wanted to say hi ... Or bye again. 
 I don't know. I ... I really tried to be a gentleman about all this. 
 But now you need to get the hell out. What are you doing? 
 Letting you go was the worst thing I've ever done. 
 It was the most painful thing I've ever done, and I'm a guy who has had 82 surgeries. 
 My threshold for pain is pretty high. 
 You need to get out. 
 I'm not your best bud. I'm not your security blanket. 
 I'm a man who's in love with you, who waltzed you into the arms of a damn knight on a horse. 
 So go to Germany and have little spaetzle-eating children. 
 And please, for God sakes, leave me alone. 
 The cafeteria is pandemonium. 
 There. 
 Are you admitting anyone? 
 No, we're signing in a few so we can give 'em sedatives. 
 That's about it. 
 E. R. 
 There's a survivor. 
 Are you leaving? No, I didn't get fired. 
 I know that's disappointing to you. 
 My trial is about to disappear. 
 You really want to act like I'm the bad guy here? 
 No, I don't. I know the fact that it is Adele changes things for Richard, but it doesn't for me. Oh, I understand that. 
 You couldn't possibly understand that. 
 If you were focused on the millions of people with Alzheimer's whose lives could've been different, would've been better because of this drug, there's no way in hell you would've pulled this stunt. 
 How is it that you don't know the difference between right and wrong? 
 Because I don't think that things are simply right or wrong. 
 Things are more complicated than that. 
 This was more complicated than that. 
 It's complicated that it was Adele and Richard. 
 It's complicated that we have a drug in a box that could help her. 
 There's nothing simple about that. 
 I am very sorry that I 
 messed everything up. 
 But I would do it again. 
 I don't know how to raise a child with someone who doesn't understand that there's a ... a right and a wrong in the world. 
 So now I'm gonna be a bad mother. 
 That's where we're going with this? 
 You've been saying it for weeks. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe you're right. 
 I just need some time to think. 
 I just ... I just need some space.

 They're doctors. 
 You ever seen this many doctors before? 
 Hey, don't worry. We're all here to take care of you, okay? 
 Hey, honey. 
 They found his body. 
 Because his wallet was still in his pocket. 
 They said because the impact. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe it was fast. 
 Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. 
 There's no battery. 
 I'm pushing the button. I don't hear anything. 
 Honey, let me try, okay? 
 The battery is dead. What are you gonna try? 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 Ma'am. Can I help you? 
 We have to call someone ... But the cell phone's not working. 
 Okay, well, we have phones that you can use. Uh, Jenny. 
 I'll do it. I'll do it. 
 Why don't you take a seat? 
 Excuse me. Is the Gordon family here? 
 The Gordons? 
 They found somebody? 
 A little girl. Unaccompanied minor. 
 They're operating on her right now. 
 Thank you. Yeah. 
 We should go home, honey. 
 A little girl made it. She's alive. 
 I think we should stay. 
 She doesn't have anyone. Her parents aren't here yet. 
 I think we should stay. Gilda ... If Matthew had been ... I would like ... to stay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 We'll stay. 
 I'll, uh ... I will let you know how she's doing. 
 Mer. 
 Oh, the adoption lady's paging me. Derek's A. W. O. L. 
 He's not even speaking to me. 
 Wait a minute. Is it a true? What ... what were you thinking? 
 I was thinking that the chief's wife was about to have saline injected in her brain instead of a drug that could stop her from being a gorked-out lump. Derek's head almost exploded. 
 Are they gonna fire you? I'm suspended. 
 The chief backed way off when he found out it was Adele. 
 I did what I had to do. Meredith ... And I couldn't live with myself if I'd done anything different. 
 And Karev is trying to ruin my life. 
 Mer. 
 What did you say to her? I didn't say anything. 
 Janet, anything he says ... Can you just shut up for one second? 
 This isn't about that. 
 We're granting you temporary custody of Zola, pending the completion of the petition, at which point, assuming all goes well, you'll be granted permanent custody. 
 And her doctor here says she's doing great, so you can take her home ... Today. 
 Her incisions look fine. She's tolerating a normal diet. 
 She'll need neuro follow-ups. She's still on antibiotics. 
 Uh, here's a prescription for any pain meds she might need, but she's been fine the last couple of days. 
 Do you have any questions about anything? 
 Meredith, do you have any questions? 
 Oh, hi. You done? 
 Uh, no, no. 
 I still have some more, uh, families. 
 Uh, sorry I paged you. I just wanted to see your face. 
 I think, you know, something like this happens, you just ... You want to be with someone that you love. 
 So we're booked on a 9:00 A. M. flight tomorrow. 
 Let's just spend the night in some fancy hotel, just never get out of the bath. 
 What? Are you okay? 
 Derek, I understand that you don't want to talk to me, but this is important. 
 I need to talk to you. 
 I'm your wife. You need to call me back. 
 Does anyone know where there's a nurse or an information person? 
 She should be right back. 
 My daughter was in the crash. 
 They said she had to have surgery. Are we supposed to ... You're Mrs. Gordon? Yes. Sarah Gordon is my d ... They're still operating. 
 The doctors have been here every half-hour. 
 They'll be here any minute. Say, would you like some coffee or ... I'll get it. I'll get it. 
 Here, sit down. You must have been driving like crazy. 
 I ... I don't under ... Are you ... We heard she was alone. 
 I thought, as a parent, if my child was here alone, I ... Well, we all thought that she should have someone pulling for her. 
 Thank you. 
 That's incredible. 
 Diapers and swaddle blankets ... And formula. 
 These little bottles are good for the diaper bag. 
 You have a diaper bag? 
 No. - Oh, we'll get you one. We've got a few in the NICU closet. 
 You know, we have all this gear ... The parents come in, the baby doesn't make it, they ... they don't want to see the stuff, so they just leave it behind. 
 Now here's the pacifiers. She likes the green ones. 
 Is your husband putting the car seat in the car? 
 Don't have a car seat. Not even sure I have a husband. 
 Surgeons, right? 
 You probably forget what he looks like without a mask. 
 We'll get you one. 
 You're probably gonna need a porta-crib, too. 
 I'm gonna throw in some more diaper cream. 
 She went with her dad to visit her grandparents, and he had to stay so he put her on the plane, and ... there was a flight attendant that watched her and was supposed to walk her to her connecting flight in Vancouver. 
 We never imagined ... God, I'm sorry. 
 I never even asked. You had someone on the plane. 
 My son ... Matthew. 
 Oh, i-is he in surgery, too? 
 Yes. 
 Will he be okay? 
 Yes, he will. 
 Sarah's out of surgery. You can come see her now. 
 Hey. 
 Can you stand up? 
 I thought I was pretty clear, Teddy. 
 Just shut up and stand up. I-I have to do something, and I can't do it while you're lying in a hospital bed. 
 I don't want a good-bye hug. It's gonna make you feel better. 
 It's not gonna make me feel a ... Can you just stand up? 
 You're my husband, and ... And I think I'm falling in love with you. 
 Hey, how you doing? 
 Ugh. Not now, Mark. 
 Oh, come on, Lexie. You've been in the dead zone all day ... You have to stop. 
 You gotta stop talking to me and checking on me and talking to my boyfriend. 
 I love you, and I am always gonna love you. 
 But I don't want to love you. 
 I want to be happy, and Jackson makes me happy. 
 And if you keep pulling at me, I'm ... I'll come back to you. 
 You're right. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You got what you wanted. You wanted a family. 
 So please just let me have what I want. 
 I said you were right. 
 I told Avery I was letting you go. 
 Did he tell you that part? Yeah. It's paternalistic and weird. 
 I'm letting you go, Lexie. 
 That means you gotta ... walk away. 
 Chief friggin' resident. Unbelievable. 
 I'm sorry. 
 What? Don't be. You deserve it. 
 I'm happy. 
 Hi. Can you take that for me? Thanks. 
 I have what I want. It's been such a crappy year. 
 I can't believe we're both happy. 
 I can't believe they like me enough to make me chief resident. They hated me for so long. 
 I can't believe I actually have friends here. 
 Well, they're gonna hate you again. 
 It's now your job to boss them around. 
 You know how much they love that. 
 Oh, God. Is that true? 
 That's true. 
 Okay, so this is the house. 
 There's another house where you're gonna have your own room, but that, right now, is just wood and no walls, so we're gonna stay here for a while. 
 Derek? 
 Okay. He might be A. W. O. L. He's had a bad day. 
 And he's a little ... pissed off right now. 
 But we're gonna be fine. 
 So we had a big plan if this ever worked out. 
 We were gonna have a lullaby from Malawi to make everything feel homey for you. 
 To be honest, right now, I can't even think of an American lullaby. 
 Lexie. 
 You know, a lot of people live here. 
 It gets kind of crazy sometimes, and it's usually not this quiet. 
 Alex. 
 Okay. 
 We're gonna be okay. 
 You and I, we're a team, right? 
 We're tough. We have that in common. 
 I am very glad you're here. 
 I didn't think your first day was gonna be quite like this. 
 But I am gonna get it together, and we are gonna figure it out. 
 Tell me how much you love me. 
 I ... I love you a very great deal. 
 A lot? 
 You love me so much. 
 I want you to remember that. 
 I made an appointment to terminate the pregnancy. 
 I'm sorry if this upsets you. 
 I'm sorry if this isn't what you wanted. 
 But ... I cannot talk about it anymore. 
 I ... need to lie down. I feel like crap. 
 This is a marriage. 
 I tied my life to you. 
 You don't decide this without me. 
 Do you see me standing here? My head is k*lling me. 
 You give in a marriage. You make sacrifices. 
 I've made many, and I am asking you to do something for me. 
 Can you simply consider doing something for me? 
 Have a baby? This isn't pizza versus thai. 
 You don't give a little on a baby. Cristina, I am asking you ... I am saying no! 
 Get out. 
 Are you ... Because I'm denying you a baby, you're trying ... Because you denied me part of the decision, because you denied me a marriage. 
 Oh, how dare you ... Get out! 
 Um, I'm gonna go. 
 I just wanted to s-say good night. 
 I want to come home with you. 
 Oh, no. I can't. Um, Tuck's with me tonight. 
 I can meet your son. 
 I'm not gonna bite your son. 
 No, it's ... it's just not the right time. 
 Uh-huh. I-I can't ... This is a relationship. Things today were bad. 
 We lean on each other when things are bad. 
 That information's not gonna hurt your child, and if it does, then this is not the right relationship for me. 
 Okay. 
 I can control myself in your house. 
 I'm not gonna touch you. Okay. 
 You just ... you know, you could tell him I'm your friend. 
 Tell him whatever you need to ... Okay. 
 Oh. I was hoping you were Derek. 
 Sorry. Well, he took off, and the hospital gave me a baby. 
 She's upstairs sleeping in some dead kid's porta-crib. 
 Uh, I'm getting an abortion ... And Owen just kicked me out of my house. 
 What? You're ... Pregnant. 
 And you're ... Getting an abortion. 
 Well ... why didn't you tell me? 
 You had a busy, busy day. 
 There's a reason I said I'd be happy alone. 
 Come upstairs. I need help. 
 I ... I can't. 
 I gotta lie down. 
 It wasn't 'cause I thought I'd be happy alone. 
 It was because I thought if I loved someone ... And then it fell apart ... I might not make it. 
 Tell me not to go to Africa. 
 Alex. 
 Go to hell. 
 It's easier to be alone. 
 Because what if you learn that you need love ... And then you don't have it? 
 What if you like it and lean on it? 
 What if you shape your life around it ... And then ... It falls apart? 
 Can you even survive that kind of pain? 
 Losing love is like organ damage. 
 It's like dying. 
 The only difference is ... Death ends. 
 This? 
 It could go on forever.","[""pital gave me a baby. \n She's upstairs sleeping in some dead kid's porta-crib. \n Uh, I'm getting an abortion ... And Owen just kicked me out of my house. \n What?

 Oh. 
 Damn, I forgot. 
 All I ask is for you to get the groceries. 
 And I forgot. I'm sorry. 
 You know, I-I-it's not like I'm sitting around. 
 I'm-I'm looking for a job. 
 Well, now we're gonna have to stop for coffee before you drop me off at work. 
 Even good marriages fail. 
 One minute you're standing on solid ground. 
 The next minute ... you're not. 
 Baby's up. 
 You change the diaper. I'll get the bottle. 
 And there's always two versions ... Yours ... and theirs. 
 So they're living together at your house, Kepner says. 
 This is my house. 
 Did she say how they're doing? 
 No. I didn't ask. 
 I don't care. 
 You ... You want me to ask, for you? 
 No. I don't care, either. 
 Hand me a rock. 
 Okay. I'm ... I can't-I can't-I can't. 
 Um, I can't have sex when there's a baby from a broken home in the next room. 
 I ... Both versions start the same way, though. 
 Both start with two people falling in love. 
 Yeah, you can. 
 Just look at me. 
 It's just you and me. 
 Dude ... you snore like a truck. 
 I'm gonna put a note in your chart, 'cause you mix apnea with your heart crap, and you're dead before you're 60. 
 Excuse me. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 You guys going to that breakfast thing? 
 Uh, yeah, after we drop her off at day care. 
 Oh, my god. Look at her. She's so beautiful. 
 Oh, oh. Hey. 
 Hey, you are so beautiful ... Here you go. 
 And you've got the best mommies. 
 Did you know that? Yes, you do. 
 Oh, you do. 
 Oh, you so do. 
 Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. 
 What is wrong with her? 
 Mm, she's getting laid. She's unnaturally cheerful. 
 Oh. Yes, you do. Peekaboo. 
 A month ago you were in med school being taught by doctors. 
 And now you are the doctors. 
 Will we be going into an O.R. today? 
 Oh, I hope so. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. New interns. 
 I hate new interns. 
 Seriously? Ugh. Mm-hmm. 
 I love new interns. 
 They're the future, the next generation ... filled with hope and promise, innovation. 
 Wow. 
 The sex with Henry must be really good. 
 Earth-shattering. 
 Shh. Sex. 
 Not even Yang's gonna get me down. 
 No, she's not. 
 Good morning and welcome to your fifth year of residency. 
 Oh, morning. 
 Morning. 
 See you guys up there. 
 I hear there's an omelet station. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay you have a good day. 
 Okay, now. Bye-bye. 
 Okay, um, I'll see you later ... Okay. 
 At the thing. 
 She slept through the night ... Hey, Zola. 
 And ate like a champ. 
 I missed you. 
 Can we talk? 
 I want to spend time with Zola before I drop her off at day care. 
 Are you gonna call Glen today? 
 I don't know. 
 I, you know, the g ... the guy is an ass. 
 Do I really want to work for him? 
 Maybe you should stop being so choosy. 
 Well, I just got laid off four months ago. All right? 
 I mean, these things take time. 
 It's all about pursuing leads and making connections. 
 I know how a person gets a job, Danny. 
 I have one, remember? 
 Good morning, and, uh, welcome to your final year of residency. 
 Um ... This-this breakfast is the one time when all the fifth years and the attendings will be in the same room, so ... so use your time wisely, residents ... Find a mentor ... Ask questions, get advice on your futures. 
 And, um, I see you're already chatting away, so that's ... that's good. 
 Just carry on. 
 Dr. Bailey, how did you do it? 
 I put down the english muffin first, then the bacon, then the eggs. 
 Oh, no ... Now some people may be surprised by this method, thinking you put the bacon on top of the eggs, and those people would be right, because ... You see what I'm doing? 
 Bam! 
 An extra layer of bacon right on top. 
 Then you put on the other half of the muffin. 
 And there you go. That's a breakfast sandwich. 
 Uh, no, no, I, uh, I mean, how did you get people to listen to you as chief resident? 
 Dr. Kepner, I am eating. Leave me alone with my food. 
 Figure it out on your own. 
 Oh, w ... Did he talk to you? 
 No, he won't even look at me. 
 Well ... you tampered with his clinical trial. 
 He thinks that's kind of unforgivable. 
 It was for Adele and the chief ... You know, I know you ... You regret that you messed up his trial but not what you did, I know. 
 You don't have to defend yourself to me. 
 I'm kind of ... unforgivable myself, remember? 
 But you're not. Not yet at least. 
 Have you told him? 
 Well ... I call him, he doesn't pick up. 
 He sees me, he walks away. 
 Okay, I'm not gonna yell ... ""I didn't get the abortion yet"" 
 down the hallway. 
 Well, so are you going to go through with it, or are we gonna sit there again and not get the abortion? 
 Tonight. 6:00. I'm doing it. 
 Oh. Gotta go suck up to Teddy. 
 You want plastics? 
 I don't see it. 
 Is this about Lexie? 
 'Cause I thought you were good with that. 
 This isn't about sex. It's about medicine. 
 Then I don't understand. 
 You're a good surgeon. 
 Not a great surgeon, which is why I was surprised Lexie was even into you. 
 But this isn't about Lexie. 
 Nope. 
 How's she doing, by the way? 
 Wow. 
 Oh, god. What is she doing here? 
 I don't ... What? 
 Is what you're thinking, right? 
 I mean, you thought that I would run away to Germany and you wouldn't have to see me again, which was a relief, I mean, after all the drama that we've been through in the last year. 
 I'm right. Tell me I'm right. 
 I ... Okay, so here's the deal ... I'm here and I'm in a happy place and I'm done with drama. 
 So if you want to learn, I want to teach. 
 G-g-great. 
 Yay. 
 Alex, this is serious. 
 If you want the peds fellowship next year, you're gonna have to earn it. 
 I just brought over a bunch of sick kids from Africa. 
 Well, did you publish and article about it? 
 Because all the people applying for peds fellowships, they've all been published. 
 You're already getting resumes? 
 Yes, and you're way behind. 
 Listen, I-I hate to kick a guy when he's down, but ... Down? Who's down? I'm not down? 
 Everybody hates you because you narced on a fellow surgeon. 
 You're a pariah. You're living in the hospital, and you look like a bum and you've ... got really bad breath. 
 Really ... really bad. 
 Do you need me to go on? 
 I ... No, I'm good. 
 Oh! Look, here's the chief! 
 Chief, is there, uh, anything you'd like to say as we embark on our final year of residency? 
 You all know what you're doing. 
 Just don't k*ll anyone. 
 Uh, Meredith, can I see you in my office? 
 Well, that was very ... inspirational. 
 Thank you, chief. 
 Nobody gets married thinking it's gonna fail. 
 Well, you're the one who needed the big wedding. 
 What is that supposed to mean? 
 It means, if we still had our savings, my being laid off wouldn't be such a big deal. 
 No, we decided on that together. 
 We both wanted that wedding. 
 No, we didn't. 
 You and your mother are the ... Stop the car. 
 Calm down. 
 I mean it, Danny. 
 You're being crazy. 
 What, are you gonna walk to work from here? 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 Stop the car! 
 You think yours is the one that's gonna make it. 
 Derek's refusing to work with me, isn't he? 
 The board met this morning. 
 They feel that a suspension would send the wrong message. 
 They feel that what you did disgraced the hospital ... the profession. 
 I'm sorry, I ... I did everything I could. 
 So what are you saying? 
 You're fired, effective immediately. 
 You're no longer a doctor at Seattle Grace. 
 And so it always comes as a shock ... the moment when you realize, it's over. 
 You walk away, and I swear, that's it. 
 All right, I-I am not gonna chase after you. 
 You get out of this car, and we are done. 
 Susannah! 
 Whoa! Ohh! 
 One minute you're standing on solid ground. 
 The next minute you're not. 
 We're going to the scene of an onsite amputation woman's trapped under her car. 
 You guys are gonna get swamped with bodies. 
 Kepner, you're in charge till I get back. 
 Yes, sir. Have fun. 
 At an amputation? 
 Uh, I-I meant good luck. 
 You know what? There's bound to be piles of head trauma. 
 Derek's gonna have to talk to you. 
 I got fired. 
 What? 
 The chief fired me. 
 You son of a bitch. 
 I mean, are you happy now? 
 'Cause this is all because of you. 
 You and your big fat, stupid mouth! 
 Get off me. Get off! 
 Kepner, control your people. 
 Stop! Stop! 
 All your fault! 
 Get off. 
 There's no hitting. No hitting. 
 Would you stop right now? 
 Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. 
 You going to the scene? 
 Yes. 
 Wait. Wait. I didn't tell you you could go. I need you here. 
 42-year-old female. Lost consciousness en route. 
 Unable to get airway secondary to tracheal injury. 
 Last B. P. is 89 over 60. 
 Don't worry. We'll figure something out. 
 Make sure there is a crike tray set up with the intubation kit. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Come on. You can't be here. You need to go. 
 It's not stable. Get away from there. 
 Oh, Dr. Torres? 
 Yeah, hi. 
 Dr. Hunt? 
 Karen Lorenz, in charge of search and rescue. 
 We're still pulling victims out of the debris, but we have a couple ... Danny and Susannah Wilson ... stuck down there. 
 He has a head wound and his ankle's messed up, but I don't see any other obvious injuries. 
 We could potentially bring him up, but he won't leave without his wife, and her leg is stuck under the car. 
 Take it easy. You'll be all right. 
 I hope you've got me with a decent resident. 
 I'm not babysitting any first-day first years today. 
 Yep, I got you with Meredith. 
 Coming through. 
 Oh, wait. Um, that's not gonna ... that's okay. 
 Uh, not a problem. I can fix this. 
 Uh, Jackson, can I get you with Bailey today? 
 I'm already with Sloan. Sorry. 
 Uh, okay. Uh, Yang. Yang. 
 Can I get you to ... No. 
 Okay. 
 Um, sorry. Hang on. 
 Let me just, um ... just figure this out. 
 Hey, Grey. You're with me. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Uh, okay. Great. There we go. 
 Dr. Kepner, three more coming in. 
 Okay. 
 It was a water main break on 3rd. 
 Probably been going on for weeks, and it just gave way. 
 Here you go. 
 Thanks. 
 We've got a vitals monitor and a camera, so we have a visual. 
 Danny, can you hear me? 
 She's-she's not talking anymore. 
 You gotta-you gotta get down here. 
 We need help. 
 Danny, Danny, I'm Dr. Hunt. Can you read out for me the top three numbers on the monitor? 
 Um ... 87. 
 63. 
 122. 
 B. P. 's 87 over 63. 
 She's shocky. How do we get down to her? 
 You don't. It's too unstable. 
 The whole thing would cave in if we sent you down there. 
 By the time we get it shored up enough to get someone down there, she'll be dead for sure. 
 I thought that's why we're here, for the amputation. 
 You're gonna talk him through it. 
 You want him to cut off his wife's leg? 
 Hey, you guys, I think she's dying. 
 You gotta get us outta here! Please hurry. Hurry! 
 Dr. Yang, can you tell me why you entered the pleura with a Kelly clamp? 
 Why? What's wrong? Am I too low? 
 Do you suspect a traumatic herniation? 
 No, no. I just want to know you're thinking. 
 'Cause that's how you put a chest tube in. 
 Why? 
 What do you mean, why? 
 So you don't k*ll the person when you do it wrong. 
 Well, tell me like I'm an idiot. 
 Uh, like I'm a medical student. 
 Why? 
 I need to make sure that your foundation is solid. 
 Why? I'm asking the questions, Cristina, not you. 
 Tell me why you entered the pleura that way. 
 What? Is Zola all right? 
 It's not-it's ... she's fine. It's me. 
 I have to go. 
 Derek ... Meredith, I can't. I just-I ... I got fired. 
 What did you think was gonna happen? 
 Danny, you've got a kit. 
 Now they're sending down a second harness. 
 The doctors are gonna talk you through this, okay? 
 Okay. 
 What can I do? 
 Kepner called. She wants you back at the hospital. 
 I can't go back there. 
 Yeah, it sucks that everyone hates you. 
 But you're not hiding out here. Go. 
 Did you get the kit open? 
 Almost. 
 Oh, my God. No. 
 No. No, no. No, no, no. I-I-I can't do this. 
 Danny, Danny, you can do this. 
 We have one chance to bring you both up. 
 In order to do that, you have to amputate Susannah's leg. 
 Oh, no. No. 
 Oh, God. Oh. 
 I need a C-spine! 
 Coming through, people. Come on. Watch your back. 
 You guys headed back? 
 Yeah, we are. 
 Does anybody have a kid? 
 Has anybody seen a kid around? 
 Where'd they pull this guy from? 
 We'll need immediate transport for her. 
 Yeah, give me just a minute here, doctor. 
 I just gotta stabilize her. 
 I need some help over here! 
 He's not breathing. 
 Get an ambu bag and some oxygen over here. 
 Right away, doctor. 
 Oh, jeez. What happened? No. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. I need help. 
 I-I think my patient's coding. 
 You think your patient's coding? 
 What's his rhythm? 
 Uh ... S. V. T. ? 
 Sinus tach? 
 Okay, there shouldn't be a question Mark at the end of that sentence. 
 I don't know. I'm freaking out. 
 It's my first day of internship. How could this be happening? 
 Go back to your patient. Does he have a pulse? 
 He has a pulse. 
 Good. Now check for breath sounds. 
 Uh, I kinda hear some, but maybe the right sounds less? 
 You gotta stop with the questions. 
 It kinda looks like he's barely breathing at all now. 
 Move, move, move. 
 Tension pneumothorax. Grab the biggest needle you can find. 
 What are you doing? 
 Tension pneumo. This guy's freaking out. 
 Step away, Grey. 
 Uh ... 14-guage? 16-guage? 
 The biggest needle you can find! 
 Okay. Get this man a chest tube. 
 And next time, call your resident. 
 I'm sorry. I-I thought that she was a resident. 
 No, she is not a resident. 
 She was fired by this hospital. 
 Had this man died under her care, the hospital would be sued, you would be sued, hell, maybe even I would be sued. 
 Now get this man a chest tube, and, Grey, get the hell outta here. 
 Pulse is not good. His breath sounds are shallow. 
 His name's Nicky Hoffman. 
 Pulse is minimal on this side, too. 
 Come on, Nicky. I need you to do better than this. 
 Thready pulses, multiple rib fractures with decreased respirations ... His body's shutting down. 
 Could be compartment syndrome. 
 That could be why his radial pulses are so decreased. 
 We need to do bilateral fasciotomies and relieve the pressure. 
 Do we have a scalpel? 
 Push 5 of morphine. 
 Got it. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Okay, you do the fasciotomies. 
 You're the fifth year. 
 All right. 
 Okay, his pulse is stronger now. 
 Good. Do the other one. 
 Sponge. 
 Here you go. 
 Thank you. 
 Nice job. You got this? 
 Yeah. 
 All right. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, Nicky. I'm Alex. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 You had a pretty bad accident. 
 We need a gunther. 
 Dr. Bailey, it's the first day of fifth year. I ... And they're at each other's throats. 
 We need a gunther. 
 I've got more pressing problems. 
 I'm trying to find a new spot for Meredith Grey. 
 You know, I heard they have a new research fellowship at Mass Gen. 
 I thought a recommendation from you might ... You want me to write a recommendation for Meredith Grey? 
 By the end of the day would be fine. 
 ""To whom it may concern,"" 
 ""Meredith Grey is an excellent example"" 
 of the kind of resident"" 
 ""you absolutely should not hire."" 
 ""She undermines groundbreaking clinical trials,"" 
 ""she has absolutely no respect for rules, authority,"" 
 ""or, as it turns out,"" 
 ""the oath that she took when she became a doctor."" 
 ""She will most likely tarnish the reputation of you,"" 
 ""your doctors, and your hospital."" 
 ""Sincerely, Dr. Miranda Bailey."" 
 Meredith Grey is the reason we need a gunther. 
 Jerry Hoffman. 
 C.T. showed a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 I cleaned and splinted his humerus fracture and sutured his facial lacerations. 
 Well, he won't need surgery, but let's do a neuro exam every two hours just to make sure. 
 Let's take a look at your handiwork. 
 Oh, dear god. 
 My grandmother could sew up a stuffed turkey ... It was ... Better than this. 
 Pretty, uh, jagged in there, so ... You ever heard of burying your stitches? 
 All right. 
 So I will fix it. 
 Oh, Jackson. 
 There's a new patient in bed 3. 
 Kinda busy, April. 
 Yeah, kinda busy turning this guy into Frankenstein. 
 Go. Go. Make yourself useful. 
 All right, I'm gonna fix this. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Don't you think you're being a little hard on the kid? 
 He's a lightweight. 
 Be thankful you have Meredith. 
 She was fired. 
 She okay? 
 I don't know. 
 Mr. Hoffman? Dr. Shepherd. 
 You're at Seattle Grace hospital. 
 There was an accident. A sinkhole collapsed. 
 My son? 
 Nicky's on his way in. 
 He's had some severe injuries that they need me to assess, but I promise you, I'm gonna take good care of your son. 
 Nicky Hoffman, sustained crush injuries and was very unstable in the field. 
 Robbins is holding a trauma room. 
 We called Shepherd from the field. 
 Which one are they in? 
 Um ... Oh, god. I-I don't ... I don't know. 
 Well, find out. 
 Well, it's supposed to be on the board. 
 People, I need you to make sure you're updating these boards. 
 April, I need you to reassign these cases. 
 Uh, Yang, take over Meredith's cases. 
 No. 
 Cristina. 
 I'm with Altman, and Meredith should keep her cases. 
 I am your chief resident. 
 You have to do what I say. 
 April, it's fine. 
 I can wait. Just sign them when you have a minute. 
 You're just gonna give up? 
 I was fired. 
 So what are you gonna do about it? 
 You have to go talk to the board. 
 The board fired me. 
 Yang. 
 What are you doing? 
 I presented as thirsty, so ... treated the symptoms with 8 ounces of water. 
 Now that I'm finished, I will place this bottle in the recycling bin so as to avoid excess strain on Seattle's landfills. 
 That's funny. You're a funny girl. 
 Come on. We have patients. 
 You need a plan. Come up with a plan. 
 Okay, now pour on that brown soap. 
 And pick up the thin silver knife. 
 Good. 
 Okay, now here's the thing ... you're gonna have to really put your weight into it. 
 Try for smooth cuts, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Now you see that area just below the tourniquet? 
 That's where you're gonna cut. 
 Do it horizontally, as deep as you can. 
 Are ... are you ... are you-are you sure she's not gonna feel anything? 
 No, she's unconscious, Danny. She won't feel a thing. 
 Okay. 
 I-I can't. 
 Danny ... take that blue towel and cover her face. 
 It'll help. 
 All right, now remember to put your weight behind it, okay? 
 Here we go. 
 One ... two ... three. 
 Oh, god! 
 Oh, god! 
 Ah. I-I hit ... I hit bone. 
 I-I think I hit bone. 
 That's good. That's good. 
 Okay, put the scalpel down now. 
 Now take the curved clamp and move it back and forth beneath the bone. 
 Ah. Ugh. 
 God. God, I-I can't. Uh, it-it won't ... Put your hand in the incision to get more traction. 
 I can't. 
 Danny, I know this is hard, but we need to create more space so you'll be able to saw through her bone. 
 No, I ... No, I-I can't. 
 Okay? This-this is my wife. All right? 
 I-I-I'm gonna k*ll her. 
 She's bleeding now ... Danny, you can't stop. 
 No, you need to come down here. I can't do this. 
 I won't do this! 
 I'm going down. 
 No, Dr. Hunt, I can't let you go down there. 
 He can't do it. 
 Yes, he can. 
 He can't. We are asking too much. 
 I'm going. 
 If it starts to go, I'm bringing you ... I should go. I'm the orthopedic surgeon. 
 You have a wife and a child. 
 I'm going. 
 You're breaking up. Can you repeat that? 
 What? 
 I have a plan. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna be a mom. 
 Okay ... Mer, there's a giant sinkhole. 
 Teddy is all over me. 
 Don't page me 9-1-1 unless you have a serious ... This is serious. 
 Maybe getting fired was a good thing. 
 What do you cheerful people say when something crappy happens and they make it sound like it wasn't crappy? 
 A blessing in disguise? 
 Yeah. Maybe that's what this is. 
 This is that. 
 And I can ... make jam and drive car pool and have playgroups. 
 And maybe that's enough. 
 And maybe I'll be a great mom. 
 Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go vomit. 
 Uh, call me when Meredith comes back. 
 And maybe you want to be a mom, too, and that's why you can't go through with it. 
 I wish I wanted a kid. 
 I wish I wanted one so bad, 'cause then this would be easy. 
 I would be happy. 
 I'd have Owen, and my life wouldn't be a mess. 
 But I don't. 
 I don't want a kid. 
 I mean, I don't want to make jam. 
 I-I don't want to carpool. 
 I really, really, really don't want to be a mother. 
 I want to be a surgeon, and please ... get it. 
 I need someone to get it. 
 And I wish that someone was Owen. 
 I wish that-that ... that at any minute, he'll get it and show up for me, but that's not gonna happen. 
 And you're my person. 
 I need you to be there at 6:00 tonight to hold my hand, 'cause I am scared, Mer, and sad, 'cause my husband doesn't get that. 
 So I need you to. 
 I am a terrible person. 
 I know. Awful. 
 I got Meredith's surgeries. 
 I'm reaping joy from the fact that my sister got fired. 
 A terrible person wouldn't feel terrible about reaping the joy. 
 Oh, uh, Jackson, Jackson, I need you to take over on a couple of these. 
 I can't. 
 I have to see a man about redoing some sutures. 
 Please. 
 I'll take one. 
 Thank you. Bed 4. 
 Bailey needs her spleen patient taken to the O.R. 
 Uh ... he's in bed 3. 
 So ... he just, um, he needs a consent form. 
 Make sure that the consent form gets put on his chart. 
 Uh, right. 
 Zola, peekaboo. 
 Peekaboo. 
 Hi, Janet. 
 Hey, Meredith. 
 I'm just finishing up your home study, and I thought I'd check and see how Zola's doing. 
 She is doing great. 
 I heard about the sinkhole on the radio. 
 I figured you'd be busy today. 
 Yeah, I'm just, uh, in between surgeries. 
 So ... how are things going? 
 Is she sleeping through the night? 
 No, I ... not really. 
 Um, she's up a few times. But it's fine. I don't mind. 
 Just you, or are you guys taking turns? 
 No, he's great with her. He's ... Derek's great with her. 
 Dr. Grey, are you taking Zola home now? 
 Because it says here that Dr. Shepherd's got her tonight. 
 Wait. I don't understand. You two aren't together? 
 No. We are. 
 We take turns dropping her off and picking her up. 
 I'm not taking her home. 
 I just came to, uh, to-to say hi. 
 I actually should get back to work. 
 Okay, Zola. I'm gonna go. 
 Okay. 
 It was nice to see you, Janet. 
 You, too, Meredith. 
 How's Nicky doing? 
 I gotta do my final exploration, check for any missed bleeders, and then I'm out. 
 The kid had a renal artery thrombosis. 
 I thought his kidney was a goner, but Alex did an interposition graft and saved it. 
 He's doing an amazing job. 
 I need to stabilize his spinal fracture. 
 So what do you got, about another hour or so? 
 Well, with the rock star over here, you never know. 
 I'd keep your pager close by. Mm. 
 Dr. Shepherd. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Janet Meyers with social services needs to speak with you. 
 Oh, what now? 
 She's waiting in the lobby. 
 I heard about Meredith. I'm sorry. 
 But you know, Meredith's strong, you're strong. 
 You're gonna make it through ... Could you guys just keep it down? 
 I'm trying to concentrate. Please. 
 All right. Just page me when you're ready, okay? 
 I'm so ... I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry. Oh. 
 Danny? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Danny, look at me. 
 You're doing great. 
 Now I need you ... I need you to cover her head. 
 Keep her head safe, all right? 
 All right. 
 I couldn't do it. I c-I couldn't ... I couldn't do it. I couldn't. 
 Danny, you did it. 
 You did the hard part. 
 All right? 
 Now, Danny ... Danny, look away. 
 All right, she's free. Good job. 
 I'm gonna finish up, and we'll both be right behind you. 
 All right? 
 Take him up. 
 Meredith, what'd you say to Janet? 
 Nothing. Why? 
 I just finished answering a whole slew of questions about Zola's sleeping arrangements. 
 She's finishing her home study. 
 That's routine. 
 Okay, there was nothing routine when she said that there were inconsistencies with our stories. 
 What did she say? 
 She said that she spoke to you and that some red flags went up. 
 Well, I did see her earlier, but I didn't say anything. 
 I gotta go. I got a surgery. 
 Well, I'll-I'll talk to Janet and I'll ... No. Don't. Don't do anything. 
 Don't talk to her. I will talk care of this. 
 You've already ... Don't talk to her. 
 Dr. Sloan, I think you're gonna be really impressed by the buried sutures I did here. 
 After you. 
 That is impressive. It is. 
 Gender reassignment, huh? 
 Yeah. 
 Normally they don't teach that till next year. 
 That's a mistake. This is not ... Call me when you find the right patient. 
 I don't have time for this. 
 Hey, uh, I need you to prep trauma 1. 
 We got another sinkhole victim on the way. 
 Stop asking me to do your work. Do it yourself. 
 And how about you tell me where Jerry Hoffman is? 
 What? 
 Jerry Hoffman? 
 Um, uh, well, he's supposed to be in bed 1. 
 That's what the board says. He's not there? 
 Does it look like he's there? 
 Oh, wait. Wait. That can't be right, 'cause if the patient from bed 2 is in bed one, then that means the patient from bed 3 must be ... Oh, no. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
 The patient is Mr. Chuck Wallace. 
 He's having a splenectomy secondary to injuries sustained in the sinkhole. 
 Yes, Dr. Grey, let's move on before my patient bleeds out. 
 Okay, I'm almost ready Dr. Bailey. 
 I just have to have the nurse show me the consent form as part of the checklist. 
 Scalpel. 
 Wait a second. 
 Dr. Grey, you're sterile. What are you ... Okay, hold-hold on. 
 Wait a minute. I'm ... I think that there ... something might be ... off. 
 I'm thinking that maybe this is ... not our patient. 
 Then whose patient is it? 
 I don't-I don't ... I don't-I don't know. 
 I just-I ... You don't know? I'm holding a scalpel in my hand. 
 I think you had better find out. 
 Stop! Don't cut! 
 Uh, it's the wrong patient. 
 That's Mr. Jarvis, who needs a lung resection, not Mr. Wallace with a splenic hemorrhage. 
 I-I'm-I'm sorry. 
 I-I-I am so, so sorry. 
 Would you make sure this gets to the medical staff office, please? 
 Yes, doctor. 
 Meredith. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Grey, we've got a guy with severe crush injuries, and Callie's come in with a field amputation. 
 Let's move. 
 We gotta get these trauma rooms ready ... I got fired. Okay? 
 I got fired. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't know. 
 Yeah, well, now you know. 
 I have to go. I have a ... Owen. 
 She didn't have the abortion. 
 She wants to and she can't do it because of you, because she loves you. 
 And instead of loving her, you're punishing her. 
 For what? 
 For being the woman that you fell in love with? 
 This isn't any of your business. 
 Okay, do you know what will happen to Cristina if she has a kid that she doesn't want? 
 It will almost k*ll her. 
 Trying to pretend that she loves a kid as much as she loves surgery will almost k*ll her, and it'll almost k*ll your kid. 
 Do you know what it's like to be raised by someone who didn't want you? 
 I do. 
 To know you stood in the way of your mother's career? 
 I do. I was raised by a Cristina. 
 My mother was a Cristina. 
 And as the child she didn't want, I am telling you, don't do this to her, because she's kind and she cares and she won't make it. 
 The guilt of resenting her own kid will eat her alive. 
 All right. Coming through. 
 No one was updating the board even though I kept telling them to. 
 I know-I know ... I have to make people listen to me but in all fairness, I've been chief resident for 12 hours and ... and yes I mean I could have lost his ... his perfectly good spleen but he didn't because of a checklist I implemented. 
 No, I haven't had excuses for what happened. I ... It's okay, just yell at me. 
 I can take it. 
 A ... It's-it's okay. 
 Shh ... No, I-I-I can ... I can take it. 
 Really. I-I swear, I can take it. I ... How deep are you placing the tube? 
 21 centimeters exactly. 
 Hallelujah, I'm in. 
 Great. 
 Now explain why you chose that size endotracheal tube. 
 Because I'm in my fifth year of residency and I know what size tube to use for a basic intubation. 
 Why are you treating me like a first year? 
 Because no one ever did. 
 I bet your first year, you could do things better than most third years. 
 Well, yes, I could. Why are you punishing me for it? 
 I'm happy. 
 That makes me see you differently. 
 Your arrogance is not your fault. 
 You're arrogant because you're so good. 
 People let you slide by, skip steps. 
 They gave you the hard stuff 
 But let you skip the easy stuff. 
 I have no doubt that you can tell me how to do a coronary artery bypass. 
 But I'm not sure that you can tell me why you chose that size endotracheal tube. 
 Look, I know what you heard, but Meredith Grey is one of the most qualified ... Yeah, I understand. 
 Yeah. Thank you for your time. 
 Not now, Karev. I'm in no mood. 
 You need to get Meredith her job back. 
 What do you think I've been doing? 
 I've spent the whole morning trying to get her a job. 
 Meredith doesn't need a job. 
 She needs this job. 
 It's not gonna happen. 
 The board's already made their decision. 
 Let me talk to them. 
 I mean, maybe I don't know what I saw. 
 Maybe I-I-I-I lied to get the chief resident ... I can't let you say that. 
 Oh, the hell you can't. 
 Karev, this is not on you. 
 Yeah, it is. 
 It's all on me. 
 Looks perfect, Jerry. 
 Second time's the charm. 
 Sutures look a lot better. 
 Really? 
 That's great. 
 No. No, no. Not great. Better. 
 Which isn't saying much considering the crappy job you did the first time. 
 You-you just said it looked a lot better, s ... This guy just fell into a sinkhole, his kid's in surgery, and now he's got a scar to remind him of this terrible day for the rest of his life. 
 You want to go tell him that, big shot? 
 Go ahead. 
 Dr. Sloan. 
 Is Nicky out of surgery? 
 Uh, Dr. Avery was just about to go check on that. 
 Um ... Wait. Bailey paged you, too? 
 Any idea why? 
 Who cares? As long as it gets me away from Altman. 
 Oh, god. 
 She's gonna fire us, isn't she? 
 Why would she fire us? 
 There was that patient mix-up in the O.R. 
 Oh. You should be fired. 
 Me? You guys didn't update the board. 
 That's why she looks so pissed off. 
 That's not good for it. 
 Uh, let me see that chart. 
 What is she looking for? 
 What have you got? 
 A field amputation with complicated extrications. 
 Still assessing her multiple crush injuries, but I felt a broken pelvis for sure, and her B. P. 's in the toilet. 
 Yeah, this is a gunther. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Do you think they can handle a gunther? 
 Oh, I think they need a gunther. 
 Uh, what's a gunther? 
 Hey. I got your message. What's up? 
 We should wait till your husband gets here. 
 You paged Derek? 
 Well, he's in surgery. That could take hours. 
 Can't you at least tell me what this is about? 
 I could tell something was up when I ran into you at Zola's day care so I made some calls. 
 It would have been better if you told me that you had been fired and that you and Dr. Shepherd were living apart. 
 But I can explain ... I'm sure you can. 
 But you understand my concern. 
 So-so what happens now? Worst-case scenario. 
 Let's not even go there. 
 Well, they couldn't take Zola, right? 
 I'm not really comfortable discussing this without your husband. 
 Well, this is urgent, so I'll go get him and I will be right back. 
 Do you have what it takes? 
 If your marriage is in trouble, can you weather the storm? 
 When the ground gives way ... and your world collapses ... He's losing his S. S. E. P. s push I. V. steroids. 
 Maybe you just need to have faith ... Scrub in. I need you. 
 I just got your page. 
 And trust that you can survive this together. 
 Maybe you just need to hold on tight ... Oh, what did I do? 
 What did I do? 
 And no matter what ... What did I do? 
 Don't let go. 
 When my mother left my father, she didn't tell him she was leaving and taking me with her until we'd landed on the other side of the country. 
 In those days, it was called family troubles. 
 Today it'd be called kidnapping. 
 Could you page Dr. Shepherd one more time? 
 I paged him two minutes ago. 
 It's really very important that I speak with him right away. 
 He's a brain surgeon. Everyone looking for him thinks it's really very important. 
 I'll let you know when he calls back. 
 Sir, you know how I said I wanted to do a gunther today? 
 I sent you an e-mail with my new screening criteria for my clinical trial. 
 Did you get a chance to look at it? 
 Not yet. Uh, Torres has a patient from the sinkhole. 
 She would be perfect for ... You know, I'm inserting an islet cell device this afternoon. 
 I'd like you to be there, see how it works, okay? 
 Oh, no. You're gonna do a hundred of 'em. 
 Can I see the next one? Today's just not a good day ... I'd like it to happen today. 
 No, sir. The fifth years are at each other's throats. 
 And it's affecting the work. 
 I almost pulled a spleen out of a man with a hole in his lung. 
 I need you in this surgery. 
 I can't have you supervise a gunther. 
 Torres can supervise. It's her patient. 
 Who doesn't love a gunther? 
 Fine. Do a gunther. 
 But be in my O.R. by 4:00. 
 4:00. Okay. Come on. Go. 
 Cristina. 
 What are you doing? 
 Oh, Bailey paged 9-1-1. 
 Well, what happened to the chest tube? 
 An intern's doing it 
 'cause it's intern's work, which I love. 
 I'm-I'm loving the back-to-the-basics thing. 
 It's so valuable, but, uh, 9-1-1, so ... Hey. 
 Oh, and you have to go. 
 So no worries. We'll talk later. 
 Um ... I had such a good attitude today, and now it's gone. 
 Dr. Webber called. 
 He's gonna put the thing in. 
 Now? 
 At 4:00. 
 Wait. They just call ... why would he do that? 
 I don't know, but I'm not complaining. 
 I just want the damn thing over with. 
 So I'll, uh ... I'll call you when I'm in a room. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 You see that? 
 I wish I did. I can't see anything. 
 Hold the nerve root retractor. 
 It's yours again, Dr. Shepherd. 
 Why is my pager going off every 30 seconds? 
 Gloria's checking on it. His S. S. E. P. s are coming back up. 
 There's still a lot of epidural bleeding. 
 Dr. Shepherd, when you have a second. 
 Does it look like I have a second? 
 What the hell is the problem? 
 They said it's something about your baby. 
 She was pinned under her car, her leg was amputated in a pit of dirt, her abdomen is pulp, and her pelvis is probably crushed. 
 You will work together to assess her injuries and repair them. 
 Oh, in the O.R. ? 
 No, at the jiffy lube. Yes, in the O.R. 
 Now Dr. Torres will supervise your work. 
 If you're k*lling her, she will step in. 
 Otherwise, you're on your own. 
 Don't screw this up like you screw everything else up you've touched lately. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, step away from the patient. 
 Is she ... is she here? 
 She is, and as soon as ... I want to see her. 
 Hey, hang on. We need to check you out first. 
 Does she know about her leg? 
 She's unconscious. 
 All right? I'll go and see how she's doing, okay? 
 Hey, lie down. 
 I will see how she is doing. 
 I'm gonna get someone to take you to C.T. 
 and then I will come back with a full report. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 It's an open book pelvic fracture. 
 And a comminuted femur fracture. 
 Has anyone fully examined the stump? 
 Pneumopericardium and an enlarged cardiac shadow. 
 She needs a chest tube and a C.T. 
 Free fluid. She needs the O.R. 
 An embolization and angio would help stabilize the pelvic bleeding. 
 An angio's just gonna waste time. 
 We could pack her in the O.R. 
 Call the O.R. Tell them to prep for an emergent laparotomy. 
 Hello? A C.T. 
 Excuse me. 
 I'm telling you guys ... Oh, no, no. 
 Something is going on with her heart. 
 What do you mean, no? 
 That's my patient. 
 We're doing a gunther. 
 What the hell's a gunther? 
 It's, uh, like a team-building exercise. 
 See, the hospital does it when the residents aren't working well together. 
 It seems to help. 
 If the patient doesn't die. One time, the patient died, and then it didn't help at all. 
 Oh. Um, so what, they, uh, prep her and then ... Uh, no, no, no. No attendings. Just the bunnies. 
 In the O.R. ? 
 Yes, the O.R. Why does no one seem to get that part? 
 No, no. Not this patient. 
 I just pulled her out of a hole in the ground that almost ate her alive, and her husband had to cut off her leg. 
 Dr. Torres will be there every step of the way. 
 Bailey ... They can handle this. 
 I said no. 
 Unh. The chief said yes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Oh, yeah? Who died and made you god? 
 Okay, look, I think what we need to do is, we just need to take a moment ... April, you're chief resident not chief of surgery. 
 Did somebody call the O.R. ? 
 No, because she needs a C.T. to assess her cardiac injuries. 
 What did I say about ... No one gives a crap what you have to say. 
 Still want to take her to radiology? 
 Maybe wait in line for a little while till the machine's free? 
 Is somebody gonna call the O.R. ? 
 They're still finding their groove. 
 Mm. 
 You've reached Dr. Meredith Grey. I can't ... Let's check the liver first. It's the most likely source. 
 What? No. 
 Hey, Yang. Where's Meredith? 
 I don't know. 
 She's in cardiogenic shock. That's our main concern. 
 Yang ... They-they fired her. 
 Maybe she's putting anthrax in Karev's locker. 
 B. P. 's tanking. We need to up her fluids. 
 No. Her pericardium is filled with air and blood. 
 Do you listen to anyone else, ever? 
 All the time. Just not you. 
 Or me, apparently. 
 Look, she's not answering her phone or her pager. 
 I haven't seen her. I was in the pit. She's not in the pit. 
 I was in the elevator. She's not in the elevator. 
 Page Dr. Grey. 
 I just did, sir. She didn't answer ... Page her again. 
 Chief. 
 Henry just told me that you called him in to insert the device today. 
 Yeah. I had an opening. 
 Well, but he hasn't had his pre-op labs and he hasn't had ... Well, we can rush the labs. It'll be fine. 
 Well, but he could come in in a week. 
 I mean, it just seems a little weird to race him in here ... Look, it is a simple procedure. It'll be over in an hour. 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Dr. Bailey. 
 I wanted to keep an eye on the gunther. 
 An intern just pulled me o ... I need you now. 
 You need to spend some time with the mice. 
 This is why I left my gunther? 
 Once you put a couple of devices in mice, putting one in a human's a breeze ... All that space. 
 Sir, I have a full schedule that I already had to take apart so I could watch you put this thing in a person this afternoon. 
 Henry ... Altman's husband. 
 I would like to keep an eye on the gunther ... Put on a mask, Dr. Bailey. 
 Even with mice, you need a sterile field. 
 This ... is mouse T. 
 He's skinny. 
 So it won't be easy. 
 Get yourself some gloves. 
 Danny, you have a little bit of blood in your brain, so I'm gonna have one of my colleagues take a look at your films. 
 Is it bad? 
 It's probably nothing, but I just don't want to take any chances. 
 Did Susannah wake up? 
 They're starting her surgery now. 
 And she does have some internal bleeding that they need to repair. 
 Well, and wh-when will y ... when will you tell her about her leg, after the surgery? 
 We'll just see how it goes, all right? 
 But-but ... I-I ... will she be able to feel it? 
 I mean, what if ... what if she sees it ... Danny ... And nobody's told her? 
 Her leg is not the big problem right now, okay? 
 She just needs to get through the surgery. 
 But she has ... an incredible team working on her. 
 Really, they're ... unbelievable. 
 Give me a 10-blade, please. 
 Don't give her a 10-blade. 
 The woman just had her leg hacked off. 
 She doesn't need her chest cracked open for something we're not even sure she has. 
 Yeah, well, I'm sure, and if her heart craps out, she's not gonna give a rat's ass about her leg. 
 Look, we know that she is bleeding from her pelvis and her abdomen, which gives her plenty of reason to be hypotensive ... Let's just do an X-lap and see what we're dealing with. 
 No! 
 Karev, start the incision. 
 Oh. 
 W-why him? Just because you're pissed that I'm chief resident doesn't mean that you can pretend I'm not here. 
 Nobody cares that you're chief resident. 
 Can everyone just shut up, please? 
 We are wasting time arguing. 
 The only logical conclusion is, take care of the heart first. 
 Hey, is the E. R. still a zoo? 
 No, they got everyone who survived out of the hole a while ago. 
 It's quieted down. 
 I'm right. 
 The changes were subtle on the X-ray, she got the crossword down there? 
 Sudoku. You ever try it? 
 Bores the crap outta me. 
 Amen. 
 A major potential source of bleeding. 
 You're outvoted, Yang. 
 Who do you think the gunther is? 
 This is not a democracy. This is surgery. 
 What do you mean? 
 Is this your first one? 
 Yeah, and there are certain rules to follow ... Hmm. The name gunther comes from the doctor, not the patient. 
 One of the residents always kind of emerges as a leader when they do this. 
 And the first time, it was this little quiet guy named Gunther, and everyone thought he was gonna flame out of the program, but it turns out, he's the alpha dog. 
 Great. 
 Airway and breathing are taken care of ... We know it won't be Avery. He doesn't have any balls. 
 Well, Karev's got the balls, but everyone hates him. 
 So I don't really see them following his lead. 
 You know what? I'm not ... Bound to be Yang. 
 I don't know. Kepner's kind of a dark horse these days. 
 Your anatomy book a good read, you'll realize that the heart ... You feel good about that position? 
 It's the main pump. 
 Huh? 
 It goes, everything goes. 
 You willing to back that up? 
 Tell us what you think is wrong with her heart. 
 What, like, 50 bucks? 
 Finally. 
 I think she has a tear in her pericardium. 
 You think she has a cardiac tamponade? 
 Bring it. 
 She doesn't even have any ... but she's hypotensive. 
 We got a plenty of other reasons for the hypotension. 
 How are they doing? 
 Still trying to agree where to start. 
 I just had to put an islet cell device ... in a mouse. 
 Do you know how small a mouse's omentum is? 
 I'm gonna go with really small. 
 Strongly consider a thoracotomy. 
 Up the dopamine to 15. 
 Happy now. She's bottoming out. 
 Well, if we'd get in there and pack the pelvis, that alone will help the blood pressure, right? 
 Well, yeah, I hope so 
 'cause her systolic's down to 68. 
 Because her heart is exploding. 
 Okay ... Is this where I step in? 
 We need to stabilize the internal bleeding and then we can get a T. E. E. while we're in there ... Yang! 
 What are you doing? 
 Opening her chest. What does it look like? 
 Rib spreader. 
 Oh, my god. 
 We'll have these lab results back in a few minutes, then you'll get a happy cocktail, and they'll take you up to the O.R. 
 I mean, his glucose levels aren't spiking or anything? 
 No. 
 I mean, nothing that would make you want to push this up? 
 Nothing. We got an opening. 
 Opening, right. 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 Are you nervous? 
 No. 
 She's nervous. It's kinda cute. 
 All right. I'm ... I'm-I'm gonna go. 
 I love you so much. 
 And you have made me ... so happy. 
 I mean, like ... like really, really happy for the first time in my life, I think. 
 Are you saying good-bye? 
 No. No. No. 
 'Cause you-you keep telling me, this is a simple procedure. 
 It is. It is. 
 It-it's ... it'll, um ... It'll-it'll ... it'll be fine. 
 Yeah, but that sounded like, ""and if I never see you again, remember I love you."" 
 It did. 
 I should go. 
 I think it's a good idea. 
 It's a rim subdural. 
 It'll probably reabsorb. 
 I'm not that concerned. You should keep an eye on it. 
 Good. 
 Everything all right? 
 Uh, Meredith disappeared with Zola. 
 Wh-what do you mean, she disappeared? 
 She ... had a rough day. 
 She probably just went out for a walk. 
 Derek, there are a hundred possible explanations. 
 Don't assume the worst. 
 You know why I do that? 
 Because lately, the level of insanity in my wife's behavior defies imagination. 
 I know, but sometimes ... even with Cristina ... sometimes, they surprise us. 
 Got some bleeding in the upper right quadrant. 
 Give me more suction and lap pads. 
 Do you see any bile or pancreatic secretions? 
 None here. 
 Negative. 
 Hey, I'm watching Henry's surgery today. 
 We should set up for autotransfusion. 
 Why? 
 'Cause the chief loves an audience. 
 Not because he's worried that something's wrong and he-he wants you there to help? 
 I don't think so. 
 What are you doing about it? 
 Have his accu-cheks been bad? 
 No, but he wasn't supposed to be in surgery for another two weeks ... And then this morning, he calls Henry up and has him race into the hospital ... He's getting batty in his old age. 
 Oh, well, that's great, 'cause he's cutting open my husband today. 
 I'll be standing there, contemplating my mortality. 
 If the batty acts up, I'll lend a hand. 
 Did you check the duodenum? 
 Something is not right. 
 You can detach the omentum from the anterior ... You know what you sound like? 
 To get a better look. 
 I'm aware of that. 
 Metz. 
 A wife. 
 Cardiac rupture, like I said. 
 A lot of bleeding down here. 
 Jackson, uh, help her hold pressure there. 
 Lap pads down in there, please. 
 Looks like Yang's the gunther. 
 Did you get it? 
 Yep. No surprise. 
 What does that mean? 
 It means she took over while everyone else is standing around looking like idiots doing whatever she says. 
 Can you suture it? 
 I mean, look at Avery. Useless. 
 I gotta go. Kepner. 
 What was I thinking? 
 More lap pads over here. 
 Oh, no. No, no. This is the opposite ... of what she should be doing. 
 I need a clamp in here. I got a bleeder. 
 I'm trying to teach her some humility, and she's running the O.R. on a massive trauma. 
 What can you do? 
 Some people are racehorses. She's a racehorse. 
 V-fib. 
 I need the paddles. 
 Charge to 20. 
 Clear. 
 No change. 
 Okay, I need 1 of intracardiac epi. 
 Someone take over massaging the heart. 
 I got it. 
 Ow! Oh, my god. 
 Ah. 
 Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Alex? 
 Look at me. 
 Alex, look at me. Alex? 
 Oh, my god, Alex! 
 What the ... Alex! 
 Racehorse? 
 My bad. 
 What the ... what the hell just happened? 
 Epi. Give me another epi. 
 Here you go, doctor. 
 I can't find a pulse. 
 Why the hell doesn't he have a pulse? 
 I need a crash cart. 
 An epi doesn't stop a healthy person's heart. 
 What did you do? 
 I don't know. 
 All right. Her heart's back. I'm gonna deal with the pericardium. 
 Forget about the pelvis for now. She's bleeding through the packing in the right upper quadrant. 
 Should I repack it? 
 Try a pringle maneuver. Graft, please. 
 Hey, uh, get me and Dr. Altman gowned and gloved, and I need something to stand on. 
 Dr. Bailey, it's under control, okay? 
 We got a lot of hands in here, and two more surgeons are only gonna confuse matters. 
 I'm gonna ask you to step back, please. 
 Can I get another pledgeted 
 3-0 prolene? Suction. 
 V-fib. 
 Charging to 200. 
 Clear. 
 Alex? 
 Alex? Alex, can you hear me? Alex? 
 You crazy bitch. 
 You almost k*lled me. 
 Oh. 
 I called home. I scoured the hospital. 
 I even had an intern call every E. R. in the city to make sure she wasn't run over by a bus. 
 There's no simple explanation. 
 Uh, why don't you let me handle talking to Nicky's dad? 
 I don't mind. 
 I'm fine. 
 How is he? 
 There were three fractures in Nicky's spine. 
 We repaired the damage. 
 Looks like, neurologically, he's intact. 
 This is the ""wait and see"" part. 
 Can I see him? 
 He's in recovery right now. 
 They're not gonna let you see him. 
 I can't believe that this is happening. 
 We were just walking down the street, talking about why ... people don't have gills. 
 I was holding his hand, and he just ... slipped away. 
 How do you go through the day when one minute to the next, your child could just ... Excuse me. 
 I'm sorry. 
 He's ... Let's go find Nicky. 
 I thought you said, they weren't gonna let me see him. 
 Well, we're gonna figure something out. 
 You need to see your son. 
 Don't touch me. 
 I'm not touching you. 
 Don't touch my gurney! 
 All right, get this artery. See right there? 
 Yeah. 
 Good. Now do a tie on the hemostat. 
 Who'd have thunk it? 
 Avery's the gunther. 
 What the hell happened? 
 Yang almost k*lled Karev, and Avery's the gunther. 
 Avery? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Get outta here. 
 Hand to god. 
 Avery ... Good job, son. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm right here if you need anything. 
 Oh, damn it. 
 My guy won. 
 We're gonna be great together. 
 Sorry. 
 A little hiccup in the gunther. 
 Well, take your time. 
 You know, I've seen you open an abdomen before. 
 Whereas Dr. Grey ... I don't want an observer. I want an assist. 
 Oh, okay. Is something wrong? 
 No, this is a teaching hospital. 
 And you're not too old to learn. 
 Yeah, but it'd be good experience for Grey to see ... Dr. Bailey, if I wanted a resident's help, I'd ask for it. 
 Here you go, doctor. 
 Thank you. 
 Whenever you're ready. 
 All right, then get back to me with her post-op crit. 
 And make sure you're aggressive with the dressings on her leg. 
 I'm still worried about an infection. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 You know why she just did what he said, right? 
 Because he's the gunther. 
 How did it go? 
 We'll have to go back for definitive repairs, but we stopped the major hemorrhaging, got the leg all cleaned out. 
 Good. 
 Nice work today, Avery. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you, doctor. 
 I just hope she, uh, pulls through. 
 Mm. 
 How's Alex? 
 He should be fine. 
 Apparently, he had an underlying arrhythmia, so the epi ... I was moving too fast and I made a mistake. 
 You think? 
 Boy, you got a mean streak. 
 I mean, you look like a nice girl, but ... scratch the surface ... Don't mess with the nice ones. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 I think I stole a baby. 
 Okay, first of all, you didn't steal the baby. 
 She's your baby. 
 What you did is, you took her for a nap ... in a very odd location and you failed to answer your phone. 
 But, you know, many people find all the technology in our lives to be intrusive. 
 So you're not the first person who didn't answer her phone ... or her pager. 
 Well, and, you know, all we have to do is ... is find a reason why you were awol for an hour. 
 Four ... hours. 
 Janet was gonna take the baby, so ... I took off. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 You know, people make mistakes. 
 I mean, I almost k*lled Alex in the O.R. today. 
 So we'll just figure it out. 
 How? 
 I don't know. 
 No. 
 How'd you almost k*ll Alex? 
 With a C. C. of epi. 
 What-whatever. You know, he'll be fine. 
 Just, um ... just stay here. I'll fix this. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 I'm gonna fix it. 
 Hand me a 10-blade, please. 
 Okay. 
 Have to be careful not to cut too deep into the omentum. 
 Uh, Dr. Webber. 
 Yes. 
 Hi. Uh, Teddy Altman here. 
 Yeah, nice to see you. 
 I-I thought that Dr. Bailey was just observing. 
 Yeah, well, she's here, so she's gonna make herself useful. 
 Dr. Webber, I'm a surgeon. 
 That's the word on the street. 
 You have an attending assisting you in a simple subcutaneous device insertion. 
 You rushed Henry into surgery with an hour's notice. 
 What ... wh-what are you not telling me? 
 Dr. Altman ... Is there something that he didn't tell me about his checkups? 
 I mean, is-is-is his hba1c to high? 
 Here we go. 
 Look, I am a doctor and I know when something is wrong, and something is wrong. 
 Dr. Altman, I'm fond of you, so I'm gonna count to 30 in my head before I call security. 
 Richard, I'm-I'm just asking you ... Get out of my O.R. right now. 
 I don't need to be here. 
 They just want to observe me and make sure I don't pass out again. 
 Mm. 
 Not a bad idea. 
 How'd the kid do? 
 He has a few spinal fractures, but it looks like he's out of the woods. 
 You need to make up with your friends. 
 Whatever. 
 One of them almost k*lled you today. 
 It was an accident. 
 Nobody has your back. 
 Nobody is looking out for you. 
 That's when accidents happen, okay? 
 This isn't a personal problem. This is a professional one. 
 It makes you a bad hire. 
 Also, it means that I have to worry about you, because no one else is. 
 And I don't want to worry about you. 
 I'd much rather be kicking your ass on my peds ward. 
 Cristina. 
 Do you want to sit and talk for a minute? 
 I do. I ... I really very much do, but I have to go do something right now, and it can't wait. 
 Please ... please believe that I want to talk to you and I'm not blowing you off because I'm a terrible person or because I don't care about you. 
 None of that is true. 
 She okay? 
 Uh, no change. 
 I just ... I don't want to mess this up like I messed up everything else. 
 What? You were great in the O.R. 
 I wasn't the gunther. 
 I was a super-duper assistant. 
 Are they gonna fire me as chief resident? 
 No. 
 It was your first day. 
 They'll just ... make you do it again. 
 It's time to place the device. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 Place the device. 
 Sir, is there anything you want to tell me? 
 Don't screw it up. 
 A surgeon doing the early stages of human trials on his experimental procedure never hands over the reins to someone else, ever, unless something is wrong. 
 Altman said this was weird, but I just thought she was being a wife. 
 Bailey ... Are you drinking again? 
 Ooh, that would explain a lot. 
 Yes, it would. God, I wish it were that simple. 
 Pick up those forceps, Dr. Bailey. 
 Now watch the superficial arteries. 
 That's where it gets dicey. 
 Let's get more retraction, Dr. Grey. 
 Right. Okay. Don't-don't ... don't rush it. 
 All right. You see those blood vessels? 
 Yep. 
 Implant the device as close to those as possible. 
 Without their oxygen supply, the islet cells would die off. 
 Good. 
 And eventually the vessels will just take over the oxygen delivery to the device completely. 
 Look at that. 
 It's interesting, right? 
 It's actually kind of beautiful. 
 Nice work, Dr. Bailey. 
 Close him up. 
 Did-did-did he just ... He just left? 
 Get up. 
 No. I'm under 24-hour observation because you almost k*lled me! 
 I revealed an arrhythmia you didn't know you have. 
 I probably saved your life. 
 I'll run an E. K. G. on you later. Just get up. 
 You're supposed to have my back. 
 I made a mistake. 
 All right? I-I-I was drunk, I was pissed off ... Oh, for the love of g ... No, I screwed up! You screw up all the time. 
 I don't have anybody. You guys are all I have. 
 You have to forgive me! 
 Fine! 
 Whatever. Forgiven. 
 Just ... get up out of the damn bed. 
 Oh, sorry. I was paged here. 
 That was us. 
 We paged your wife, too. Do you know where she is? 
 Well, that is the question of the hour. 
 I have no idea where she is. 
 Well, we'll fill her in later. 
 Shut the door, please. 
 Dr. Webber just informed me that he tampered with the dr*gs and placebos in your clinical trial. 
 Excuse me? 
 N-no. 
 It was, uh ... Meredith. 
 Dr. Grey apparently was covering for him. 
 She knew and she ... was trying to protect him. 
 You have my apologies. 
 I destroyed your trial. 
 She wasn't covering for you. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 I'm protecting your wife. What are you doing? 
 This is wrong, and you know that. 
 What are you trying to do to her? 
 She was trying to save Adele. She was trying to save me. 
 At what point are you gonna stop punishing her for that? 
 And there's no pain in your abdomen? 
 Nope. 
 Really? Or are you just being stoic for me? 
 I'm a man in a gown. I can't pretend to be brave and strong. 
 You can. 
 I kinda lost it today. 
 Dr. Webber kicked me out of the O.R. 
 Really? 
 Okay, um, so ... You know how we both figured that since I was a doctor that ... I would be really calm while you were having your surgery? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 That may not be the case. 
 You're just a mess, like any ordinary wife would be? 
 Yeah, it's pathetic. 
 I think it's adorable. 
 I have a chronic tumor condition. 
 I'm a frequent flyer in the O.R. 
 I'm gonna be a basket case every time. 
 So sad. 
 Uh, if you're headed in there, you may want to wait. 
 They're acting like he just came back from the wars. 
 What? 
 Something happened with the chief. 
 W ... Where have you been? 
 We've been trying to reach you for hours. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Where's Zola? 
 Hey. Susannah just got out of surgery, and it went as well as it could have. 
 We're not gonna know much for a little while. 
 Okay. 
 Look right here. 
 We had such an awful fight right before. 
 I ... I brought up her mother in an argument, and th-that-that is one of the red buttons. 
 I swore I would never do that. Why-why did I do that? 
 She'll forgive you. You saved her life. 
 Maybe for a while, and then she'll get better and she'll remember why she got out of the car. 
 Maybe she won't. You know? 
 Maybe you both just decide to forget, move on ... Pretend it never happened. 
 Does that work? 
 It can't hurt to try. 
 You're married? 
 I-I'm sorry. It's ... it's not my business. 
 I didn't mean to pry. 
 Oh, that's all right. Yes. 
 Yes, I'm married. 
 What did you do? ! 
 I want you to shut the door and then I want you to sit down. 
 You're throwing your whole career away for that damn girl? 
 This is not the end of my career. 
 The FDA will never come anywhere near you again. 
 That is the end of your islet cell trial, not to mention any other thing you might be cooking up with the FDA ... Sit down! 
 You ... Open it ... What ... And read the first page. 
 ""The artificial pancreas: A cure for diabet ..."" 
 How about ""The artificial pancreas:"" 
 ""A-a huge missed opportunity that you blew"" 
 ""because you ..."" 
 Read the next line. 
 ""Principal investigator: Miranda Bail ..."" 
 It's yours now. 
 I have no pending trials with the FDA. 
 Ever since her surgery, Zola's had weekly blood tests, and, uh, the results I got today were a little weird, so I wanted to take a look at her. 
 Yeah, and, you know, with babies, I mean, when a doctor calls ... I got worried, so I just rushed her right in, and I must have left my phone in the day care center. 
 And your pager. 
 My pager I had to turn in because they fired me. 
 What's wrong with her? 
 Her white count was elevated. 
 14. 5. Um, I wanted to make sure there wasn't a post-op infection or a C.S.F. leak or something. 
 Um, on my exam, she looks fine. 
 No signs of spinal shock. 
 I re-ran her C. B. C. , and her white count was 8. 
 Totally normal. 
 Must have just been a stress reactant ... Or a fluke in the labs, 'cause, uh, well, she's fine. 
 It's true. 
 C.S.F. leaks are a problem with spina bifida babies. 
 That's ... that's great you caught that. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean for any of this ... I didn't mean for any of this to happen. 
 I know. I know. 
 I still don't understand what you possibly could've been thinking. 
 They fired me. 
 Janet basically told me they were gonna take Zola away. 
 I mean, possibly send her back to Malawi. 
 You and me? 
 I just needed some time. 
 I just needed to hold her and look at her and just think about how everything ... everything got so screwed up. 
 You should take Zola. 
 Janet has a problem with me, not with you. 
 And we need to do whatever we can to make sure they don't take her away, and if that means that you have custody of her and I don't, well, then that's what we need to do. 
 You're not fired. 
 Richard's gonna take the fall for you. 
 What? 
 He can't do that. I'm not gonna let him do that. 
 Yes, you will. 
 If you want to keep this baby, you will let him protect you. 
 Dan? 
 Oh, my god. 
 Sweetheart. 
 Danny, I was scared. 
 Oh, I know. 
 I didn't know where you were. 
 I'm right here. 
 You-you were asleep, and they-they didn't want me to wake you up. 
 I fell down. 
 You sure did. 
 You stayed, though. 
 I'm not going anywhere. 
 Don't go anywhere. 
 I'm right here. 
 Oh, I love you so much. 
 You're a big baby. 
 Mm. 
 Okay. 
 All right, the top row all got the device on the first round. 
 Dr. Webber tweaked the protocol pretty substantially after that, which means the second set, that's these guys here, they all ... tend to do a lot better. 
 I've been off the project for the last couple of weeks, but I'm pretty sure I remember the drill. 
 I can walk you through it. 
 It had to be mice. 
 All right. 
 Let's take it from the top. 
 How's it looking? 
 Can't tell. 
 They can't just take the baby away, can they? 
 I don't know. 
 Meredith says you didn't do it yet. 
 I didn't change my mind. 
 I know. 
 I know. You don't change your mind. 
 You'd cut off my leg for me, wouldn't you? 
 Well, I wouldn't botch it like that guy did. 
 I'd leave you a good stump so you could get a prosthesis. 
 When's the appointment? 
 Now. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go. 
 I ... Oh, god. 
 They're not gonna find a better family than two doctors. 
 It's-it's gonna be fine. 
 Anybody want to go check on Sofia? 
 Why? 
 'Cause when somebody's talking about taking someone's baby away, you want you to see your baby. 
 Oh, you guys. She's fine. 
 I'm right behind you. 
 Ma-maybe we should leave, too. 
 I mean, I'm sure they don't want us just sitting here staring at them. 
 I don't know. 
 They're trying to keep a family together. 
 That's ... not easy. 
 You know, it can't hurt to stick around, make sure they're okay. 
 You see, this-this is why you're the gunther. 
 I have terrible leadership instincts. 
 That doesn't make me a better leader. 
 A better person maybe, but ... We are in a bit of a bind right now. 
 A lot of questions came up today about your relationship, about your employment ... Well, she got her job back. That was a misunderstanding. 
 She disappeared. 
 Well, that was a-a miscommunication. 
 And the part about you two living in separate houses, that's miscommunication, too? 
 Look, I get it. 
 It's not easy bringing a child into a relationship. 
 You're allowed to have some bumps in the road. 
 But this afternoon, when it looked like you two had split up, your wife got fired, she lied to me about it and left with the baby. 
 I set off some alarms. 
 Now I'm trying to dial them all back, but it's not that easy to do. 
 Once the system is set in motion, there's a certain protocol that has to be followed. 
 Once the agency believes that there are questions about Meredith ... Janet, Meredith is the best mother a child could have. 
 She loves Zola. She loves me. 
 And if there is a flaw with her, it's ... she loves people so much that she'll do anything for them. 
 Derek, please. 
 I hear you. 
 But no matter what I say, social services still has to reevaluate the placement. 
 And while that happens, Zola can't be in your home. 
 I'll give you a minute to say good-bye. 
 We should ... we should let her sleep. 
 She's ours. Nobody's taking her away. 
 And ... she'll wake up in half an hour, and then we'll ... take her home for dinner. 
 So ... Nah. We should wake her up. 
 Yeah. 
 Hi, little baby. 
 Daddy's here. 
 Boo. 
 Hi. 
 Daddy's here ... Hi, sweet girl. 
 Little goose. 
 Adele. Honey. 
 Yeah, I'm on my way home. 
 No, I'm not working late. 
 I told you, I'm having dinner with you. 
 Yeah, well ... This time I mean it. 
 Okay. 
 I'm gonna give you an injection to numb the cervix. 
 If you'd like some I. V. diazepam, it won't knock you out, but it'll calm you down. 
 Okay. 
 I want to ask you one more time ... Are you absolutely sure this is what you want to do? 
 Then let's get started. 
 Sorry ... It's ... time to go. 
 Derek. 
 Here you go. 
 Okay. Hey. 
 Janet is a very nice lady. 
 We like her a lot. 
 Yeah. 
 She's gonna find you a very nice family to go stay with for a while. 
 And then you're gonna come right back to us, and everything's gonna be fine. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 She likes her bottle room temperature, not too warm. 
 And she cannot sleep without that giraffe. 
 It's in the front pocket of the diaper bag. 
 And there's extra pacifiers in there. 
 You're gonna need them when you p-put her in the car. 
 You think that true love is the only thing that can crush your heart ... the thing that will take your life and light it up ... or destroy it. 
 Then ... you become a mother.","[', he doesn\'t pick up. \n He sees me, he walks away. \n Okay, I\'m not gonna yell ...

 He has P. T. S. D. 
 From the w*r, and she's had it, too. 
 From the sh**ting, but not at the same time. 
 We-we didn't have it at the same time. 
 And mine wasn't as bad as his is. 
 You lay on the floor of an O.R. 
 You choked me. 
 You quit being a doctor. So ... For a little while. 
 Uh, but now we're fine. 
 Really? 
 Oh, sure. Okay. We're fine. 
 I meant the P. T. S. D. 
 Okay. Yeah. We're fine. 
 We're fine. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Except for the part where you aborted the child that I wanted. 
 Except for the part where you held my hand while I exercised my right to choose and then four months later, you screamed I k*lled your baby in front of all our friends. 
 When you've tried everything 
 but that headache won't go away, you can't stop coughing, the swelling won't go down, that's when you turn to a professional. 
 So ... 
 As surgeons, we spend years developing skills of perception 
 that allow us to see exactly what the problem is. 
 You haven't even looked. 
 Amy, I am telling you, it is unrescetable. Let it go. 
 I came all the way from L. A. to show you this. 
 You could spend more than 30 seconds. 
 I am looking right at it. 
 It's a gliosarcoma that has invaded the carotid artery. 
 You try and remove it, she will stroke out. 
 Stop being a jackass. 
 Wow. 
 I'm ... she called ... she called you a jackass. 
 Dr. Grey, excuse us. 
 Dr. Grey, stay here. I need backup. 
 Fine. 
 You just got out of rehab. 
 I want you to get on your feet. 
 But you can't help her. 
 Look at his face. 
 His name is Mason. 
 This gliosarcoma belongs to his mother Erica. 
 He's a great kid. I don't know him that well, but he seems great. 
 I do know his dad well. His name is Cooper, and he works with me and he is a good guy. 
 He is a good dad, which means he is the one who is gonna have to tell Mason that his mom is dead, that he doesn't have a mom anymore because we didn't do anything. 
 You tell Cooper you're sorry. You tried. 
 Let it go. 
 I have a surgery. 
 Trouble is, sometimes all that time spent 
 developing those skills of perception 
 can leave a person with an extremely narrow point of view. 
 And how are you supposed to argue with someone 
 who has science on their side? 
 Ah. 
 65-year-old woman enters the E. R. in shock. 
 Presents with a pulsatile, expanding abdominal mass. 
 Go. 
 Ruptured triple-A. 
 I would take the patient straight to the O.R. 
 and access the peritoneal cavity through a vertical midline incision. 
 Nice. 
 You guys studying for the oral boards in the middle of the day? 
 Just another benefit of having a study buddy. 
 You should get one. 
 I have one. 
 It's just that my stupid study buddy's too busy trying to save her stupid marriage to actually help me study. 
 Well, you know what's better than a study buddy? 
 A study lackey. Check it. 
 Hey, you. 
 Brown-haired girl, you're up. 
 Uh, trauma incident or a surgical situation? 
 You made your interns come up with study questions? 
 Surprise me. 
 A 12-year-old boy fell off his bike, hitting his abdomen against the handlebars. 
 Complains of progressive abdominal pain and is short of breath. 
 Breath sounds cloudy. 
 What is it? 
 Sloan. 9-1-1. 
 Hey, if you want, we could ... I don't need help. I'm an excellent surgeon. 
 You know it, and I know it. 
 Everybody knows it. 
 I don't have to prove myself to anyone. 
 Yeah, except to the american board of surgery. 
 Yeah, there's that. 
 Meredith Grey. 
 No. 
 Not Grey. 
 Yang, maybe. 
 Yang's a cowboy. 
 Kepner. 
 Kepner? 
 Not kepner. 
 Definitely not Grey. 
 She spent all that time in neuro, and suddenly, she's chasing general. 
 She's unfocused. 
 You're underestimating her. 
 I think she'd surprise you. 
 She'd have to. 
 She will. 
 She'll have to come to me. 
 I'd do an exploratory laparotomy. 
 You said that already. 
 I know. Um ... The patient's still crashing? 
 Yep. 
 Oh! I gotta crack open his chest. 
 You've gotta what? 
 Uh, relax. N-not you. 
 Good morning, Chuck. 
 Hey, Karev. And, Dr. Peterson, it's always nice to see you in peds. 
 Thank you, Dr. Robbins. 
 Uh, so, uh, Chuck's looking pretty good. 
 Um, his, uh, abdominal pain's decreased, and I think it's a good time to schedule a gastroscopy. 
 Great, great. 
 Well, then, you're in luck, Dr. Peterson, because I think that Karev would be an excellent supervisor for your first gastroscopy. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay, uh, Megan. Let's go schedule that gastroscopy. 
 Uh, it-it's Morgan. 
 What is? 
 My name. It's Morgan. 
 Whatever. Same difference. 
 Carrie Rissler is my patient. 
 Has been for eight years. 
 I'm aware. 
 She was given six months to live, but after a mastectomy, oophorectomy, and risky experimental biological therapy, I managed to save her life. 
 Which is awesome. 
 D ... no, it is not awesome. 
 It is a miracle. 
 And when I saw on the O.R. board that my patient ... my miracle ... is undergoing a lymph node transfer without my knowledge ... She came to us, Dr. Bailey. 
 Said she brought it to you a few months ago, and you shot it down. 
 'Cause her extensive scarring makes her a poor candidate. 
 That's what I thought. 
 But then Avery suggested we do some angio studies on her arm ... Avery suggested? 
 Dr. Bailey, this procedure has had outstanding results for patients with-with vessels just like Mrs. Rissler's, okay? 
 This ... this could make it worse. 
 It-it-it could even k*ll her. 
 That's not gonna happen. 
 Well, y-you're right, it's not, because you're not operating, not after I speak to my patient. 
 You paged me 9-1-1 to get yelled at? 
 No, I paged you 9-1-1 so that you could help me convince Bailey we're doing the right thing here. 
 You failed. 
 Okay. So what do we do now? 
 Well, let's hope Carrie's a little bit more persuasive than you are. 
 Dr. Torres, Dr. Webber suggested ... Unh-unh, here's how this is gonna work ... I talk, and you listen. 
 You are here because you and your little pals are all freaked out about the oral boards, and Dr. Webber suggested that Callie Torres might have a special secret study method, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, Dr. Webber's correct. 
 Callie Torres does have a study method, an excellent study method, but she's not about to just give it away. 
 Callie Torres' study method has to be earned. 
 Frankly, she doesn't think that Meredith Grey has what it takes. 
 I think she does? 
 I think Meredith Grey has what it takes? 
 His B. P. was low and his vessels are collapsed. 
 We could only get one good I. V. in. 
 We're gonna have to get another one. 
 For her sake, Meredith Grey better hope she's right, 'cause today, today is gonna be a grind. 
 Excuse me. Coming through. 
 Excuse me. 
 A grind? Really? 
 It's a meat grinder. 
 Oh, whatever. Like you weren't thinking it, too. 
 Hang in there, Dom. 
 Yeah, you're looking good, bro, real good. 
 You're lying, Tommy. 
 I look like sopressata. 
 Don't worry, Dominic. 
 We just gave you some dr*gs for the pain. 
 Okay. 
 You're gonna start to feel better real quick. 
 What do you think, Dr. Torres? Is this an amputation? 
 I-I don't know. Is it? 
 Tommy. 
 What? 
 No, you tell me, Dr. Grey. 
 Does this look like an amputation to you? 
 I mean, yeah. 
 Amputate? 
 No, you can't. I need my hand. 
 Tommy, don't let them take my ... All right. 
 Whoa. Is he ... No, those are the dr*gs. 
 They work quickly, just like we have to. 
 But you're just gonna cut off his arm? I mean, I ... No, this is a teaching hospital, Mike, okay? 
 I'm doing a thing. 
 Grey, here's how it's gonna work if you want my help on the boards. 
 You're gonna run this. 
 You're gonna decide our course of action. 
 You're gonna be the person that stands between Dominic and a hook for a hand. 
 You in or you out? 
 I already said amputation is our best option. 
 Oh. Best? 
 Yeah, best. 
 Okay, so book an O.R. and fire up the bone saw. 
 Let's move him out, people. Grey wants to amputate. 
 Whoa. 
 Yeah. 
 Dr. Torres, wait. 
 I have a finger here. 
 I knew that already, Dr. Grey. 
 No, a viable finger. 
 Look at the cap refill. 
 I-is that bad or good? 
 Dr. Grey, is that bad or good? 
 That's good. 
 All right. So what do you want to do? 
 I think we should take this thing off and see what's left. 
 All right. Time's a factor here, Grey. 
 Why is time a factor? 
 Because the longer his hand stays in there, the more we compromise his circulation. 
 Tick tock, Dr. Grey. 
 So let's call up to maintenance and get a sawzall. 
 Mm. You really want to wait that long? 
 Uh, fire and rescue has tools. 
 Better. 
 Okay. 
 Hey, th-these tools, what are they gonna do, Rip apart the grinder? 
 To save his hand. 
 Yeah, we dropped a couple grand on that thing. 
 You can't trash it. 
 To save his hand? 
 Mike, how long is it gonna take you to get that thing apart? 
 I-I take it apart and ... and clean it every night. 
 We can get him out. 
 Yeah. 
 Quick. 
 Dr. Torres? 
 Can you do it in under 45 minutes? 
 Give or take? 
 Grey? 
 Dr. Grey what? 
 Do I think it's okay to let a couple of civilians take apart the machine that's grinding their brother's hand? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's do it. 
 Okay. I'm gonna need a set of allen wrenches and a phillips head screwdriver. 
 Make that two. 
 Stat! 
 Hang in there, Dom. 
 Hey, you paged? 
 Look, I can remove the tumor and the diseased carotid together. 
 All I have to do is run balloon catheters in through the femoral, place them in precise position, inflate them to stop the blood flow, do two arteriotomies, then feed a heparinized shunt into place, and reestablish blood flow. 
 That's all? 
 Oh, and I have to do it in 90 seconds. 
 Any more than that, and she strokes out. 
 Is that even possible? 
 Not sure. I would love to test it out. 
 We should set up a simulator. 
 Uh, don't we need to get Derek's approval? 
 Yeah, but that shouldn't be a big problem ... He loves to say no to me. 
 That is his favorite thing to do. 
 Maybe you should refrain from calling him a jackass. 
 I can't help it, 'cause he is one. 
 Maybe I should ask him. 
 Would you? 
 Yeah. 
 He's in surgery, O.R. two. 
 You just called me down here so that I would go to Derek for you, made me feel like it was my idea. 
 Aren't I good? 
 Amazing. 
 I have always been clear ... You have not always been clear. 
 She loves to say that. 
 Always been clear ... I do not want kids. 
 He knew that. 
 I did not know that. 
 You knew that. 
 I did not know that in the beginning. 
 What, I have an icicle in me, and I'm supposed to tell a stranger, ""Hey, I don't want to have kids""? 
 I'm not talking about the icicle. 
 I am talking about after. 
 After. 
 No, I told you when it was relevant to the relationship. 
 Most people would've considered dropping a b*mb like that before the wedding. 
 That is when it would've been relevant. 
 Well, uh, you proposed, and we were married like 12 hours later. 
 So sue me if, in the moment, I was thinking of other things. 
 I-I know the lymphedema is bad. 
 Oh, it's miserable. 
 These are sausages, not arms. 
 I can't lift them. Oh. 
 I'm in pain all the time. 
 I think ... Look, we just need to be happy the cancer is gone and look at the lymphedema as ... the price we're paying ... The price I'm paying. 
 Oh, look ... You don't think I felt awful, sneaking in here like a thief to get my surgery? 
 But I'm just ... You saved my life. 
 You know how I feel about you. 
 You're a hero to me. 
 But I ... I want to be able to brush my hair ... hold my grandson. 
 Erin had a baby? 
 Having one, in the spring. 
 Oh, e ... oh, my ... she was just starting college when you were first diagnosed. 
 I know. 
 You promised me I'd make it to her graduation. 
 If you ... really think this is a mistake, I won't do it. 
 O-okay. You got it? You got it? 
 I got it. 
 So what's your plan, Grey? 
 Okay, my plan is, they get this thing off, and then we assess. 
 Right, but what if they don't? 
 You need an alternate plan. 
 Well, I don't need an alternate plan, because they're gonna get it off. 
 What'd you do? 
 I didn't do anything. 
 The more you guys loosen that, the more he's gonna bleed. 
 Should we stop? 
 No, keep going, just go faster. 
 Y-you sure you have time for that? 
 If you have something to suggest, why don't you? 
 Now you're just wasting everyone's time. 
 Well, we have to get him up to the O.R. 
 or he's gonna bleed out. 
 Yeah, well, his hand's still trapped in that grinder. 
 Let's get a pneumatic tourniquet on his arm above the grinder. 
 That'll buy us a few minutes. 
 Okay. 
 I can give you guys 15 minutes, and after that, I have to amputate. 
 Understood. 
 We've operated on worse. 
 Lexie, she showed us a picture of a little boy. 
 I know. I-it's clear that she is passionate ... My sister is too emotionally wrapped up in this patient to clearly see that she can't help this woman. 
 You know, it tells me that she's passionate enough to try harder. 
 Yeah, well, all the passion in the world is not gonna make her plan doable in 90 seconds. 
 You need to see that for yourself, fine, set it up. 
 Only you're gonna be the one who sees a thing. 
 I mean, thank you. 
 Dr. Robbins said I would be doing this. 
 Yeah, how can you do a gastroscopy and read the index cards? 
 Come on. Keep 'em coming. 
 Congenal aganglionic megacolon, also known as ... Hirschsprung's disease. 
 Typical treatment? 
 A pull-through procedure. 
 Did you skip symptoms? 
 Uh, symptoms, right. Sorry. 
 Don't crap out on me now, Megan. 
 Morgan. 
 Uh, symptoms, uh, severe and persistent tightness in chest, indigestion, blurred vision, shortness of breath ... Yeah, that's not Hirschsprung's. 
 Severe headache, nausea. 
 Patient is 24 weeks pregnant. 
 Yeah? Well, that narrows it down. 
 Uh ... it could be P. I. H. 
 Yeah, I'd order labs and, uh, a U. A. 
 then I'd take her down to the O. B. 
 so she could be monitored. 
 Okay. Yeah. Y-yeah. 
 You should ... you should probably do that. 
 Hey. Hey. Hey! 
 Hey. 
 Are you gonna just stand there or are you gonna help her? 
 Morgan? 
 When were you gonna tell me you were pregnant? 
 Everybody in this hospital knows that I'm pregnant. 
 But then they ... they also know my name. 
 Well, there's a good fetal heart rate. 
 The baby looks fine. 
 These are definitely not contractions. 
 List the symptoms. 
 I am not quizzing you right now. 
 No, your symptoms. Chest tightness ... Nausea, shortness of breath, indigestion. 
 You mean like, uh, heartburn? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Page cardio. 
 You're having a heart attack. 
 There is no deeper reason. 
 There has to be. 
 There is no deeper reason. 
 I wasn't abused. 
 I-I don't have a dark secret. 
 I wasn't mugged by a baby. 
 I just don't want kids. 
 Nobody doesn't want kids. 
 People can not want kids. It's a thing. 
 That is not a thing. 
 Well, it's my thing. 
 You're gonna change your mind. 
 You're gonna change your mind in three years or five. 
 You're gonna change your mind about having a baby, and then it's gonna be too late. 
 And you're gonna regret it. 
 And I will know and understand that I made a choice. 
 I choose medicine. 
 I choose me. 
 I choose that over the remote possibility that I might one day regret not having a child. 
 And by the way, it's all right to never want kids. 
 Some people don't ever want kids. 
 Well, I want to know why. 
 Why? 
 In 2004, I was removing mets from Carrie Rissler's abdomen and pelvis, and decided to go for one near her liver when she started bleeding out. 
 As I was trying to stop the bleeding, she went into heart failure. 
 I had to send her to the I.C.U. , tell her daughter Erin that she was in a coma and that there was a good chance she wouldn't wake up. 
 But she did. 
 And she still had two more surgeries ahead of her and chemo and radiation. 
 Her body is a b*ttlefield ... I get it. You talked her out of it. 
 No. 
 You're doing the lymph node transfer, but not without reading every page of this file twice. 
 But we're supposed to operate in half an hour. 
 Then start reading. 
 Okay. 
 I'm watching you, Avery. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Come on. 
 I almost got it. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 B. P. 's dropping, Grey. 
 You guys need to be done now. 
 Just one second, Dr. Grey. 
 Just one-one more ... And done. 
 We should be able to turn back the auger and pull him out. 
 No, we'll pull him out. It's time for you to go. 
 Grey, take this. You've got the auger. 
 Okay. 
 Look, can't we just stick around and see ... There we go. 
 Oh, holy god. 
 Okay, so ... we've got a piece of hand with sort of fingers on it. 
 What about these? Can these be saved? 
 I don't know. Can they? 
 Boom! 
 97 seconds. 
 Bite me! 
 Wow. 
 Sorry. 
 Just ... Sorry. I just ... I've been at 97 seconds for 8 freakin' tries now. 
 Maybe not the ninth. 
 If I can find another stopwatch. 
 I mean, Derek's probably right. 
 I'm just ... I'm gonna let her down. 
 He should know. I've let him down enough times. 
 Let's take a break. 
 Let's go, uh, you want to get something to eat? 
 I want something. 
 It's not food. 
 There's a guy who got his hand stuck in a meat grinder. 
 I ... wouldn't mind seeing that. 
 Yes. 
 Okay, Morgan, you had an acute M. I. 
 from a spontaneous coronary artery dissection. 
 Are you kidding? I-I don't have any of the risk factors. 
 Yeah, well, most likely, related to your pregnancy. 
 We need to get you upstairs right now. 
 Dr. Robbins, why are you here? 
 We need to repair the dissection immediately. 
 My baby's fine, right? You said that my baby was fine? 
 Morgan, listen to me ... If my baby's fine, why are you here! 
 Lie back, lie back, listen to me. 
 All right, we need to go right now. 
 But it's too early to take the baby out. 
 He-he-she could have R. D. S. or get septic? 
 The dissection's extensive. 
 We have to put you on bypass in order to fix it, so the baby needs to be delivered now. 
 She barely has any lungs. 
 24 weeks is premature, but there's a very good chance. 
 No, you-you can't say that, okay? 
 I know what you can and can't say is very good ... and you can't say that. 
 Listen, my baby was born at 23 weeks, and it's terrifying, I know, but I'll be here for you. 
 We're all gonna be here. 
 Will someone call my boyfriend? 
 His name is the first in my phone. 
 All right. Karev, call her boyfriend and let him know what's happening. 
 I'm scrubbing in. 
 She's your intern, Karev. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Uh, wait. Uh ... Her name's, uh, Megan, right? 
 Her name is Morgan. 
 Grey, I'm surprised. 
 I wouldn't think you'd be thrown by a little thing like a severed finger. 
 Yeah, well, it's just, it smells like pork. 
 I might get lost in work there she goes again. 
 She's gonna yack. 
 Would you quit it with that, all right? 
 I gotta finish this thing before I go into surgery. 
 Hey, where is your study lackey? 
 Of course the one competent intern in the whole program just so happens to be pregnant and needs surgery for a coronary artery dissection. 
 Morgan needs surgery? 
 How do you know about Morgan? 
 Everybody knows about the pregnant intern, Karev. 
 There's my ride. 
 Here we go. 
 If Morgan needs surgery, then why are you here? 
 My attending gave me a job ... call the boyfriend. 
 I left, like, six messages. 
 Chris is a fourth year at the Cleveland clinic. 
 I mean, you know how busy it gets. 
 How do you know his name? 
 They're not just amputating and fitting him for a prosthetic? 
 No. 
 She thinks she's gonna be able to salvage the finger bits and reattach, because she's cracked. 
 That's gonna be so much harder. 
 You know what else would be harder? 
 Going through the carotid. 
 For fingers? 
 It would be harder, but there'd be better control than going through the femoral. 
 All right. All right. Come on. Here we go again. 
 Come on, Mer. Just a few chunks. 
 Oh, come on. Just puke already. 
 Oh, that's a good-looking lymph node. 
 You got it? 
 Yeah. 
 Oop. 
 Did-did he say ""Oops""? 
 Dr. Bailey. 
 What a pleasant surprise. 
 The man said ""Oops."" 
 I didn't. 
 Actually, Dr. Bailey, I just said ""Oop."" 
 He was picking up a lymph node, almost dropped it, but didn't. 
 Let's make some room so Dr. Bailey can get a better view of our every move. 
 As you were, Avery. 
 Y ... you-you don't want a little more suction, Avery? 
 Dr. Bailey, while I'm always glad to hear your perspective, I'll instruct the resident. 
 But your instructions result in oops. 
 We don't oops in my O.R. 
 Let's try a little more suction. 
 With Mr. Hamilton's laminectomy, I want an epidural drain for the next few days. 
 Yes, doctor. 
 You should at least listen to her. 
 Look, I swear, you gotta stop encouraging her. 
 Well, this is what you taught me to do. 
 You taught me to not give up until we've tried everything. 
 Because you can handle it. 
 When we lose a patient, I know if you're okay or you're not because I'm right there with you. 
 With her, I cannot do that, because I don't think she can handle it. 
 Not now. 
 You are the one who is too emotionally involved. 
 Okay, if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor, you would still be looking at it. 
 You are so worried about your sister's outcome, you won't even think about her patient's. 
 Am I wrong? 
 You have to try. 
 I am. I'm-I'm trying. 
 We're supposed to focus on each other and breathe, and you're not. 
 I mean, your mind is totally elsewhere. 
 Oh, so now you know my every thought and intention? 
 We used to be able to look at each other. 
 And I'd feel ... like we were gonna be okay. 
 There is a reason we're together, Owen. 
 There is a reason we're married. 
 Please. 
 Look at me. 
 All right. I'm looking at you. 
 Right now ... I'm looking right at you. 
 He has to stop holding a grudge. 
 He has to see me for who I am. 
 He has to take his little list of all my crimes and rip it up, otherwise ... Otherwise what? 
 You know, I-I don't know. 
 How about you stop thinking that you're the sun, and that I revolve around you, and that being a cardio god, maybe that isn't everything, and maybe what I need is worthy of some consideration? 
 And we're back to the abortion? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, we are. 
 I'm ready for the transfer, Avery. 
 Dr. Sloan. 
 Yes. 
 You know that this patient has a history of multiple surgeries in that area. 
 She sure does. 
 Okay, then I don't understand why you think it's a good idea to continue to dissect right there. 
 Respectfully, Dr. Bailey, it's not entirely important that you understand everything I do every step of the way. 
 Uh, no, respectfully, Dr. Sloan, I disagree. 
 I think it's extremely important. 
 Now if you had read the file like you said you did, you'd know that she'd have massive scar tissue exactly in the area that you're dissecting, so I think going forward with that dissection is a monumentally stupid course ... Respectfully, Dr. Bailey, uh, the bulk of that scar tissue is gonna be found near her axilla. 
 So if Dr. Sloan continues dissecting right there, I really don't think there'll be a problem. 
 And I-I read that in ... in-in the file, the file that you ... Carrie's file ... that you gave me to read, I ... I did ... I did read it. 
 Damn it. Oh, we've got a big bleeder here. 
 Is that subclavian? 
 Respectfully, doctors, I told you so. 
 Okay, so I think it'll work. 
 If we cut down the macerated part of the finger, it'll be short, but it'll still be salvageable. 
 Okay, but this thumb, I'm gonna go ahead and say that's not salvageable. 
 Yeah, you're done here. 
 He'll be better off with a prosthetic. 
 No. 
 The thumb is responsible for 40% of hand function. 
 Without it, we're done. 
 But there's gotta be something else. 
 I mean, I read something about surgeons using a man's big toe as ... as a replacement for a thumb. 
 Let's do that. Let's ... let's use his big toe. 
 Listen, Dr. Frankenstein, the big toe, it's pretty important, you know, for walking. 
 And he can learn to rebalance. 
 Or he can keep his toe where it is. 
 This is a good fix. I know it is. 
 No, it's not. 
 Dr. Torres, it has to be. 
 The big toe is not the fix. 
 That is why we're gonna use the second toe. 
 It'll provide the same benefits, but reduce potential disability. 
 Really? 
 Yeah, but we're not doing anything without the patient's consent. 
 All right. Tell me what you're trying to do. 
 I'm going in through the carotid with two catheters, uh, one in the proximal ... A carotid stick? That'll k*ll her even faster. 
 Damn it, Derek ... Amy, I'm sorry, but you can't stop and reestablish blood flow in 90 seconds. 
 I mean, I can't do it in 90 seconds. 
 Oh, well, the great god of neurosurgery has spoken ... Look, now I'm-I'm trying to help you. 
 But please don't put yourself through this. 
 You're too fragile. 
 I am not fragile. 
 I'm a drug addict. 
 I've fallen off the wagon twice, and I've gotten back on. 
 That does not make you fragile, Derek. 
 That makes you very freakin' strong. 
 I am standing in a building full of pills right now, a fact that I am painfully aware of, but I am doing this. 
 That is not fragile. 
 Okay. 
 Show me what you're trying to do. 
 So you think there's a way? 
 No, I don't. 
 But I can't stop you, so, um ... I'll be here with you. 
 Show me what you're trying to do. 
 I was right. 
 Right? 
 Too soon to tell. 
 Cut the crap, Torres. 
 You two are gonna put a toe on a man's hand. 
 That was her idea. 
 Maybe we are. 
 His toe? ! Are you serious? ! 
 Maybe we're not. 
 Tommy, calm down. 
 I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. 
 It's just ... That's weird. 
 Yeah. 
 But if I say okay, I get my hand back? 
 Otherwise, you fit me for a hook? 
 A prosthetic, but if you give the go-ahead ... He gets a hand. 
 Well, what are you looking at me for? 
 Take my toe already. 
 Take my left nut if it'll help. 
 I ... think the toe will be fine. 
 I was right. 
 So ... this is how you're gonna spend your time now, pulling strings behind the scenes like some kind of puppet master? 
 I am really good at it. 
 So I'm a 2-month-old baby. 
 Symptoms? 
 I'm underweight, fussy, I belch, and when I vomit, it hits the ceiling. 
 You have pyloric stenosis. 
 These cards are so detailed. Whose are these? 
 Uh, well, those would be the smart one's. 
 The only smart one. 
 What the hell? 
 What happened to Morgan's baby? 
 Wait. Morgan had her baby? 
 Oh, crap. 
 One more clamp, please. 
 Well, is it subclavian? Can you get under the clavicle? 
 Vascular clamp. It's still oozing, Dr. Avery. 
 How do you want to proceed? 
 Um ... I, uh, I don't ... I don't know. 
 Oh, he did not just say ""I don't know."" 
 Man, tell me what you see. 
 We're staring straight at the defect. 
 You think we should call in vascular? 
 No, no, I think-I think we can repair this ourself. 
 Um, maybe patch it? Stick-stick tie. 
 Patch it? 
 Yeah. Isn't that ... No, no, it's a good thought. Get on that. 
 Bovie. 
 Sorry, Dr. Sloan. Just a little distracted here. 
 Dr. Avery, let me give you one small piece of advice. 
 If there is anything, I mean anything, distracting you from helping your patient, you need to leave it outside. 
 Oh, respectfully, I ... This is your patient now. 
 Yours. 
 Uh, someone had better tell me what is going on and had better tell me right now. 
 Dr. Bailey ... you need to leave this O.R. 
 Excuse me? 
 This patient, my patient, developed a subclavian bleed because we misjudged her adhesions. 
 But I am now doing an arterioplasty, which is not an easy thing to do, and you are making it more difficult by distracting me. 
 You are compromising my ability to care for my patient, Dr. Bailey. 
 Well, if you're telling me you can't focus in ... I'm telling you, you need to get out. 
 Now. 
 Oh, Dr. Sloan, if you let your resident speak to an attending this way ... Dr. Bailey. 
 I believe Dr. Avery made it very clear. 
 Leave the O.R ... or I'll have you removed. 
 Get out of the way! Move! Move! 
 Damn it! 
 Wait. Is that for the Peterson baby? 
 For the mother. It's not good. 
 All right. Get outta the way! 
 Come on. Come on. 
 Crap. 
 What the hell happened? 
 We were barely in the NICU before he suffered an intestinal perf. 
 Scrub in. I need your extra hands. 
 Uh ... uh, give me a minute. 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, this is, uh, Dr. Alex Karev. 
 I work with, uh, Morgan in Seattle. 
 Uh, listen up, you're ... you're fourth year, right? 
 Good. Listen up, she's still in surgery, but she's critical, so's the baby. 
 You need to get on a plane right now. 
 Oh, come ... Meredith and I do not do everything together. 
 The twisted sisters. 
 Yeah, well, we're best friends. What do you expect? 
 She has a baby. 
 Oh, my god. That doesn't mean I have to. 
 I don't see why not. You do everything else together. 
 It's like you're a team. 
 Because she's my person. 
 I should be your person! 
 Be my person! 
 Be my person, Owen! 
 Be my freakin' person! 
 Be my person. 
 He's dorsal dominant, so I'm not going to use a plantar incision to find the artery. 
 Okay. 
 And I have isolated a good draining vein. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Is that it? You're not gonna ask me if I'm sure? 
 Are you ... sure? 
 Yes. 
 Okay, then. 
 You're impressive. 
 I am. 
 Look, there's always been a lot of hype surrounding you, okay? 
 ""Meredith Grey, ooh, child of Ellis."" 
 ""Ooh, isn't she so special? "" 
 You don't have to help me if you don't want to. 
 No, no, no, that's not ... that's not what I'm saying. 
 I'm saying ... you're tougher than I thought. 
 I'm saying, you're smart. I'm ... saying ... okay, look ... you know, we've never been friends, not even when I was with George. 
 Mainly because you thought I was a freak and you're blonde and very ... And now you have a baby, and I have a baby, and we're both married, and ... I don't know. I'm saying, we're both alike. 
 I'm saying I'll help you. 
 You're not a freak. 
 And we can be friends. 
 Every morning, five days a week, you are in my office at 4:00 A. M. 
 and we work, Grey. 
 If you don't show up, if you are late, I will kick your ass. 
 We work, Grey. We work. 
 And you're gonna pass this test. 
 You're gonna pass it hard. 
 Okay. We've got it threaded. 
 We need to position the balloons and then inflate. 
 You need to get yours in position faster. 
 I think you should do it. 
 You can do it. You just gotta get in there faster. 
 Okay, ready? Inflate. 
 Starting the clock. Let's move. 
 Mr. Price is awake and responsive. 
 And the rest of the post-ops are done. 
 What are you doing? 
 We needed two surgeons. 
 One on the internal carotid, the other on the external, controlling the balloons. 
 We've almost got it to 90 seconds. 
 You think it's gonna work? 
 Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
 It's one step, one step of a very complicated tumor. 
 He doesn't think it's gonna work. 
 Well, we're gonna go down trying. 
 That's all. Thank you. You can go. 
 I want to go down trying. 
 All right. Pick up the stopwatch. 
 Ready? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, little boy. 
 I'm Dr. Robbins, and this is Dr. Karev. 
 You've got a long road ahead of you, but we're gonna do everything we can to help you. 
 And your mom, too. 
 How's she doing? 
 Morgan? 
 Oh. I haven't checked. 
 I ran a pregnant chick all over the hospital today. 
 Made her quiz me on my stupid boards till she damn near died, and I haven't even checked to see how she's doing. 
 Apparently, I'm the only person in this hospital who didn't know she was pregnant ... because I'm too busy worrying about my own stupid damn self to even make an effort to learn my interns freakin' names. 
 It doesn't matter if I pass those boards or not, I don't deserve that fellowship. 
 You know why I like you so much? 
 I honestly have no idea. 
 You remind me of me. 
 Peds surgeons? We're-we're vicious. 
 We're the most hard-core surgeons in the hospital. 
 I mean, when I was a resident, I was ... I was a full-on horror show. 
 But that's what it takes to learn how to save tiny humans like this one. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
 But do me a favor. 
 Learn your interns freakin' names. 
 We may not like it ... 
 but it really is important 
 to stop every once in a while, get out of your own head, and see the bigger picture. 
 Uh, Dr. Sloan, I need a word with you about Avery. 
 Dr. Bailey, I have a patient. 
 He was right. 
 Avery ... he was ... was right. 
 She's gonna be able to use her arms. 
 So ... why did I say no? 
 You were being careful. 
 Yeah, but she was my prize patient. 
 I've done ground-breaking work on her behalf. 
 You were a resident like Avery. 
 You get more experience, you get more conservative. 
 C-conservative? 
 O-oh, is that what success buys you? 
 What, you get happy and then you get scared? 
 Don't want anything in life to change? 
 You're a grown-up. You're risk-averse, 'cause you know risk has actual consequences. 
 That's why we keep residents around. 
 They keep us fresh. 
 Are you telling me that I'm not young anymore? 
 I'm trying to tell you, you've arrived. 
 Oh. 
 You pull that crap in my O.R. again, I'll report you to the board. 
 Actually ... 
 finding out that you've been looking at things all wrong ... 
 can be sort of liberating ... 
 What happened? 
 You're fine. 
 You know, Altman, she did a kick-ass repair on you. 
 My baby? 
 Where is my baby? 
 He's stable. 
 Okay? I mean, uh, that's the first thing. 
 He? 
 Oh, yeah. That's ... I guess the first thing. 
 He's, uh, he's a boy, and, uh, he's, uh, stable. 
 But? 
 He's intubated. 
 We're giving him indomethacin to, uh, treat his P. D. A. 
 and he had a, um, spontaneous intestinal perf that we fixed. 
 Robbins, she's, uh, she's observing him right now. 
 Listen, Morgan, he's ... he's doing great right now. 
 And Robbins is watching him, and, you know, when she leaves, I'm gonna watch him, and, you know, I-I talked to Chris, and he's on his way right now. 
 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 So, you know, I thought I'd just hang out here for a while with you, and, uh, you know, wait till Chris gets here. 
 Leave it at that, if that's okay. 
 You're hanging out here because it's quiet and you need to study. 
 What? No. No way. 
 You should. 
 I-I would. 
 And suddenly you see new potential ... 
 new possibilities ... 
 Okay. 
 Where you'd never seen them before. 
 Done. 
 We have blood flow. 
 86 seconds. 
 Call your patient. Get her up here. 
 And that's all fine when a hopeless situation 
 suddenly looks good. 
 Unfortunately ... 
 I'm afraid our time is up. 
 Sometimes it goes the other way.","["" not on the same page. \n Oh, be ... because I don't do what you want me to do. \n Because you had an abortion. \n Uh, we've done couples therapy before. \n He has P.

 ""The foot bone's connected to the leg bone."" 
 I think you're beautiful. 
 ""The leg bone's connected to the knee bone."" 
 In med school ... You learn, it's a little more complicated than that. 
 I'm trying to love you. 
 Why won't you let me? 
 But still ... have a baby? 
 This isn't pizza versus thai. 
 You don't give a little on a baby. 
 Cristina, I am asking ... I am saying no! 
 The song's not wrong. 
 It hurts ... To love you. 
 Everything is connected. 
 Oh! 
 I'm still shaking. 
 You do that every day? 
 Well, not on the weekends, usually. 
 I'm pretty sure I'd be an alcoholic if I had your job. 
 Mm. Well, they kind of frown upon alcoholism in my line of work, so ... Whoa. Nice. Mm. 
 Wow. 
 See? 
 That's why I could never be a surgeon. 
 Well, uh, thank you for the drink. 
 I-I gotta go. 
 One more. 
 Come on. Please. It's the least I can do. 
 And then what happened? 
 Cristina. 
 And then what happened? 
 Cristina, I don't know what good this is doing. 
 There isn't any good. This ... Seriously, how could this be doing any good? 
 I'm not saying ... Cristina, I ... Stop saying my name. 
 The foot bone's connected to the leg bone. 
 The leg bone's connected to the knee bone. 
 I want to fix this. 
 I want to fix this. 
 Whatever you want me to do, I will do. 
 But this ... You're asking me to hurt you. 
 You're asking me to ... t*rture you with the details ... Of you having sex with another woman. 
 Yes. 
 And if you take one piece out ... I wanna know every detail. 
 You wanna fix this? 
 I wanna know how this happened. 
 The rest just ... Falls apart. 
 You've found a 7. 5 centimeter triple-a on your 85-year-old patient. Go. 
 Get an angio, assess his pulmonary and cardiac function, and see if he's a candidate for ***. 
 Nope. Why not? 
 Because the patient's dead. You k*lled him. He's dead. 
 I didn't k*ll him. I did a stent graft and now he's living without the threat of a rupture, which is not dead. 
 Mm. I think you should buy him flowers, 'cause he dead. 
 He is not dead. 
 I saved him the complications of an open procedure with a minimally invasive technique. 
 He's ... not dead. 
 Why are we stopping? 
 Because we're done. 
 Because I k*lled him? I told you, I did not k*ll him. 
 I know, and so do you, even when I try to psych you out of it, which means ... You're ready for the boards. 
 The Torres method is inside you. 
 So I'm gonna go home to my wife because I am sick of pushing this baby around this park ... Every morning at the butt crack of dawn. 
 And I ... Uh, you're free, Grey. 
 Go do whatever it is you do. 
 Uh-oh. Ooh, okay. 
 Don't get me wrong, I love this. 
 Oh, I like that, too. 
 But, um, this is your 
 ""drink coffee in the tunnels with Cristina, ""bitch mode, griping about the world"" time. 
 This is your Yang time. Wh-what's going on? 
 Nothing's wrong. You want me to stop? 
 I didn't say you should stop. 
 I asked you what's wrong. Mm. 
 Oh, damn it. 
 What? 
 ""'Excellence is not an act, but a habit, ' Aristotle."" 
 Avery, what is Aristotle doing in our staff meeting, and why are you even in here handing these out? 
 You mean when I could be practicing medicine or studying for my boards? 
 Yeah, I've asked myself that same question. 
 Mmm. Mmm. This is delicious. 
 When did hunt bump up the doughnut budget? 
 As chief, I'm a firm believer that a nice variety of baked goods is the right way to start any meeting. 
 As chief? 
 What are you talking about? 
 Seriously? Seriously? Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Wait. What happened? 
 Okay, calm down, everyone. 
 Dr. Hunt and Dr. Yang are down with the flu. 
 I'll be acting chief in Dr. Hunt's absence. 
 Could be a day. Could be a week. 
 What do we got for today? 
 Let me get this straight. 
 Dr. Hunt asked you to fill in as chief ... You, Mark Sloan, by name? 
 Yes, he did. 
 Any other questions? 
 I like the part about 
 ""excellence is not an act but a habit."" 
 Hey! So I got us a reservation at Jane's on market. 
 It's the one with the little twinkly lights all around it. 
 Have you been there yet? It's new. 
 We haven't. 
 It's beautiful and kind of romantic, and I realize that ladies night is different than date night, but I have been in the lab for the last two weeks, and smelling like formaldehyde, and I just ... I need to be someplace beautiful. 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Oh, great. Good. I'm excited. 
 So excited. This is gonna be great. 
 Am ... am I talking really fast? 
 Not ... not in a weird way. 
 I'm sorry. I'm ... I'm just wired. 
 The house is so quiet when it's empty, you know? 
 I've been leaning really hard on the coffee. 
 But anyway, okay. So I'll see you guys tonight. 
 Ladies night. Yay! 
 I have no idea what just happened. 
 I told her last week that, uh, we'd do a ladies night. 
 Mm. Like at a girl bar? 
 Do we need to have a talk about boundaries? 
 No, no, not a ""ladies night"" ladies night. 
 Like a just a night out for Teddy. 
 Okay, so do we have another lady, or is it just two lesbian moms and a widow at Seattle's most romantic restaurant? 
 Ugh. Ooh! 
 Bailey. 
 Really, that's your go to? 
 What? 
 So, um, Teddy ... poor, sad, widowed Teddy ... wants to have a girls night. 
 Uh, ladies. Ladies night. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Well, no, it's ... it's her first night out. 
 It's a big step. She needs us. 
 Well, she has you, the two of you. 
 That's about as much happy as any person can bear. 
 She made a reservation at a romantic restaurant. 
 I mean, would you want to be a third-wheel widow at a restaurant with us and a bunch of twinkly lights? 
 You're buying. 
 Well, I figured everyone could pitch in for our dear friend, the widow. 
 Okay, fine. We're buying. 
 See you tonight. My God. 
 I've got some good news for you, Neil. 
 Mm? 
 You've changed your mind about euthanasia? 
 We found you a donor. 
 For the whole thing? 
 The whole thing. 
 Dr. Webber, you know I love you, but I believe you stood me up at this dance before. 
 But I am here with a new corsage. 
 Dr. Grey. 
 Neil Sheridan, 62, presents with short gut syndrome caused by a resection of the small intestine. 
 Years of T. P. N. has caused the liver to fail, resulting in the need for a multi-organ transplant of the small intestine, large intestine, stomach, pancreas, and liver. 
 All from one guy. 
 Try to find that on Craigslist. 
 And we've scheduled you for surgery today. 
 I'll believe that when I see it. Oh. 
 Neil, do you want me to call your family? 
 I'm sure they'd love to visit. 
 Oh, don't worry about me, sunshine. 
 My family came to say their good-byes the first two times. 
 ""We love you. We'll miss you."" 
 It ... it was sweet, but I've heard it. 
 I told 'em not to bother this time around. 
 Okay. 
 Well, if you change your mind, you let me know. 
 I will. Okay. 
 But I won't. 
 Oh. Where have you been? 
 We're halfway through the new batch of flash cards. 
 Yeah, hunt and Yang are out sick today, so Sloan's the chief, and I am the chief's bitch. 
 Lucky me. 
 No distractions. Kepner, hit me again. 
 Okay, a-a woman with dysuria, incomplete voiding, and a palpable suburethral mass. 
 Urethral carcinoma. 
 Damn it. I had one of those last year. 
 Um, uh, we did, uh, radiation and surgical excision. 
 No! Would it be, uh, chemo? 
 An ectopic ureter, or it could be. 
 I mean, I scrubbed in on one of those, but I don't remember the technique the urologist used. Damn it. 
 Sounds like urethral diverticulum. 
 And if it's proximal, I 
 would do a partial ablation because it's much less likely to result in a fistula. 
 You don't even need to know advanced urology for the boards. 
 But I do, because the Torres method is in me. 
 Ugh! Total crap. 
 You get to study with Torres while the rest of us get to sink like rocks. 
 I hope you're happy when you're alone in the O.R. 
 And the rest of us are working the free clinic at the mall. 
 My whole brain is crammed with so many hypotheticals, I can't even remember what real cases 
 I was actually there for. I am screwed. 
 I'll tell you who's screwed ... Yang. 
 The boards are around the corner, no one's seen her study, she's out sick. 
 She's gonna get creamed. Yang is fine. 
 You can't just pass the boards on raw talent, okay? 
 It is an artificial environment, which requires massive amounts ... Cristina is fine. Okay? 
 What is the point? 
 What is the point? 
 The point is, I wanna know. 
 The point is, I have a right ... You don't have a right, not to this. 
 No, I have a right as your wife to know what you did. 
 I'm not gonna do this. 
 I am not gonna tell you every detail. 
 I cheated. 
 Yes. 
 I cheated. I did a horrible thing. 
 I know. I know I did a horrible thing. 
 But this is not what we're gonna do. 
 I'm not gonna play a little movie of all of my crimes so that you can decide that I'm a monster. 
 Okay, well, then get out. Oh. 
 You want me to leave? 
 You're answering the phone? 
 It's Meredith. She's called, like, five times. 
 If I don't answer it, she'll come over, because we have the flu, remember? 
 Hey. 
 Hey. H-h-how are you feeling? 
 Uh, I'm okay. It's just the flu. 
 Well, I should come and check on you, because it could be something more serious than the flu. 
 No, it's, uh ... It's fine. It's the flu. 
 Owen's there? 
 Yeah, Owen is here. 
 Um, he's sick, too. 
 Oh, I bet he is. 
 Cristina, I ... I gotta go. 
 Cristina, wait. 
 Cristina? 
 So am I staying or am I going? 
 That's up to you. 
 It was the day after we quit therapy. 
 And I met her at the hospital. 
 Yeah, we're fine. 
 We're fine. 
 I should be your person! 
 Be my person! Be my person, Owen! 
 Be my frickin' person! 
 Be my person. 
 29-year-old female. M. V. C. Collision with a truck. 
 Take her to trauma one. 
 Hypotensive in the field. 
 She received 2 liters L. R. en route. 
 Okay, let's get trauma labs and set up for an ultrasound. 
 All right. I'll check it. 
 Is anybody with her? 
 I am. 
 What was her name? 
 Honestly? I ... I don't remember. 
 He's in the car. 
 Chief. 
 See, from 1:00 to 2:00, you have ""lunch with the chief."" 
 I told you to call it 
 ""beef with the chief."" 
 It's got a ring to it. 
 You got a beef, come meet with the chief. 
 I didn't realize you were serious about that. 
 You need to let people get the little things off their chests before they become big things. 
 I'm serious about this chief thing, Avery. 
 It's my shot. I want to do it right. 
 ""Beef with the chief,"" put it in the schedule tomorrow. 
 Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Warren. 
 Here. 
 Mr. Cooper. How are you feeling? 
 Like I would k*ll my own mother for a burger and a shake. 
 Jason Cooper, 29-year-old male with advanced juvenile arthritis, causing fusion of the jaw and extensive fusion of the c-2, c-3, and c-4 vertebrae. 
 He's been on a feeding tube for the past eight months. 
 No solid food at all. 
 Well, don't worry, Mr. Cooper. 
 After we break your jaw and put in those sweet titanium hinges I made for you, you'll be eating burgers again real soon. 
 could we have a word with you outside, please? 
 Of course. 
 Ben and I don't think we should do the surgery today. 
 Why not? With his cervical fusion, lying him down on an operating table is gonna put pressure on the base of his spine. 
 Not to mention that orotracheal intubation is impossible on this guy. 
 I'll do nasotracheal, but if there's any compromise to the tube while he's under and he's got no mobility ... Let's just say, I can't guarantee anything. 
 Well, what's your recommendation? 
 Well, we postpone the surgery until other plans can be made. 
 And, Dr. Avery, what would support performing the surgery as soon as possible? 
 The, uh, patient has a major abscess in the back of his mouth. 
 Which could lead to sepsis or endocarditis. 
 Infection's a k*ller, which is why this can't wait. 
 So let's figure out a way to get Mr. Cooper into surgery on schedule. 
 Well, frankly, I don't know what you think I can do for him 00 this afternoon. 
 Rise. Excuse me? 
 You have it in you. Lost causes, right? 
 Making the impossible possible? 
 Rise to the challenge, Shepherd. 
 I believe in you. 
 Rise. 
 Oh. 
 All right, guys. 
 So you take orders from Sloan now? 
 Hey. Where do you think you're ... You just can't take those. 
 Oh, I was just gonna copy 'em and bring 'em right back. 
 It'll, uh, take two seconds. 
 They don't teach you about H. I. P. A. A. in med school? 
 You don't see a copy machine, do you? 
 That's because these charts are private. 
 They don't get copied and they don't leave this room, ever. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I'm a fifth year. I'm just trying to study for my boards. 
 I need real cases. So read 'em. 
 Read 'em all, but they don't go outta here except in your brain, understand? 
 Yeah, I think I do. 
 There you go. 
 Hey, you got a busy schedule today? 
 Uh, why? 
 Do you need help with that thyroidectomy? 
 Because I-I've never done one, and I was just reading about how it can sometimes cause a thyroid storm, which is r ... How cool is that, you know? 
 Yeah, maybe. 
 Um, listen, your whole, uh, photographic memory thing ... mm-hmm. 
 H-how does that work? 
 You want me to memorize these? 
 Yeah. 
 A-all of them? That'll take forever. 
 Lexie, we need your help. 
 We can't keep doing stupid hypotheticals off index cards. 
 We need someone to question us off real cases. 
 I have rounds. I have post-ops. 
 Lexie, next year when Karev and I are attendings, we will be assigning surgeries and putting in our recommendations for chief resident. 
 Are you sure you want to get off on the wrong foot? 
 No. 
 No. 
 Great! 
 It is so much fun that you're gonna be studying with us. 
 You get to watch the game tonight. 
 I do? 
 I gotta go to some girls night 
 Callie and Arizona put together for Teddy. 
 Oh. 
 I mean, that's good, right? 
 Wasn't I gonna get some long story about how this is ... ""The game of a lifetime, ""and if you would just sit still for five minutes, you might appreciate the beauty of ..."" 
 You and I have been on completely opposite schedules for, like, two weeks. 
 Tuck is at his dad's. 
 So I wasn't planning on watching the game tonight. 
 You weren't? 
 Thank you, doctor. Nope. 
 Well, what were you planning to do? 
 Well, I could say it out loud, but ... here you go. 
 It would be inappropriate for the workplace, so I'm just gonna think it. 
 Ohh. 
 I'm gonna get out of girls night. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, I got the donor scans. 
 Oh, great. Let's see what you got. 
 There. 
 Bowel looks good, small intestines, large intestines, and that's a good-looking pancreas. 
 Look at that on the liver right there. 
 Looks like a tumor. 
 Well, that makes him an unsuitable organ donor. 
 Not necessarily. Could be a benign adenoma. 
 My patient's been in for two other transplants, and they both fell through. 
 He's not gonna live much longer without a new liver. 
 We could resect it. 
 It's a little unconventional to operate on a donor, but there's no reason why it wouldn't work. 
 That's a great idea, Bailey. 
 Great idea? You want to put compromised organs into a transplant recipient and give your guy cancer on top of everything else? 
 I think we owe it to my guy to at least excise the tumor and test it. 
 I don't agree. 
 Dr. Sloan, are you arguing surgical protocol with Dr. Webber? 
 Dr. Bailey ... are you arguing with the decision of the chief of surgery? 
 Call U. N. O. S. 
 Tell them this donor's unsuitable. 
 Put Mr. Sheridan back on the list. 
 We've put you back on the transplant list. 
 And a new set of organs can come in at any time. 
 Cut the crap, Dr. Webber. 
 You and I both know I'm not gonna make it to see the sunrise tomorrow for some other poor sad sack to stick to kick it ... . 
 Mr. Sheridan, is there anyone we can call for you ... your family, your sisters, your friends? 
 Are you kidding? 
 Thank God my family's not around for this. 
 It's like Lucy with a football, except it's my life. 
 It would k*ll them worse than the first two times to come in here and say good-bye to me. 
 We're all alone in this world, sunshine. 
 Anybody who tells you any different is lying or trying to s-sell you something. 
 Now you ... You are the best doctor I ever had. 
 So don't beat yourself up about this. 
 It's done. It's over. 
 You did everything you could. 
 No. 
 No, I didn't. 
 Sir. 
 Bailey, your tumor resection idea was sound. 
 And there was no reason why those organs wouldn't work. 
 Well, the donor is still on life support. 
 The organ recovery for the heart and lungs isn't scheduled till this afternoon. 
 But Dr. Sloan s ... You let me deal with chief Sloan. 
 When you're the chief, you gotta make the hard decisions. 
 Webber knows that. It comes with the job. 
 Who's our first appointment, Avery? 
 No one on the schedule, chief. 
 That's why you shoulda called it ""beef with the chief."" 
 People would've shown up for that. 
 You got a beef? 
 Actually, I would really love to go study for my boards. 
 No. 
 I know, I don't have an appointment, but do you have a moment to talk about Jason Cooper's jaw reconstruction? 
 That's fine. He's wide open. Have a seat. 
 There you go. 
 I think I can carve out of foam a cradle that holds the patient's head and neck during surgery, reducing the chance of respiratory complication. 
 That's a good idea. 
 But you can do better. Excuse me? 
 Well, foam's fine if nothing goes wrong, but it won't be flexible enough if we have to adjust him mid-surgery. 
 It's a good idea, but ... are you aware ... I'm aware ... of what ... That that surgery is taking place at 3:00, and Jason Cooper's airway needs to be secured. 
 So rise, Shepherd. 
 Rise. 
 Hey, um, I can't do ladies night. 
 Sorry. Mm. What? 
 But we need you. 
 Well, um, I can't come because, well, Ben and I are ... taking dance lessons tonight ... salsa. 
 You and Ben ... yeah. 
 And salsa? 
 No, you just want to go home and get laid. 
 Hey, we have a long-standing salsa appointment tonight, and ... sorry. You're on your own. 
 Right. 
 I bet it's gonna be long. 
 Mm-hmm. Real long. 
 She's almost finished. 
 She has read all of your charts and none of mine. 
 Yeah, I found her. I brought her here. 
 Hey, Lex, can you take a look at some of my cases, too? 
 Or not. I mean, it's ... it's fine if ... if you don't want to. 
 It's okay. I-I can. I-I will ... Thank you. 
 No, no, no, no, you will not. 
 Not until she's finished with mine. 
 Okay, these take priority, Lexie. 
 You don't need Lexie. You got Torres. 
 They're for Cristina. She's not even here. 
 Which is why she needs the help. She does not need the help. 
 She just needs to finish mine. And you know what? 
 Yeah, but you know what? There is no compromise. 
 You don't have half a baby. 
 I don't want one. 
 We live like you want, how you want! 
 You get whatever you want! 
 Wow. I didn't realize how late it got. 
 Mm. I know. Me, too. 
 Well, um ... Okay, uh, well ... Good night. 
 Good night. 
 Thank you again for saving my friend's life. 
 Oh, oh, this ... it's just my job. 
 Kiss me. 
 I'm drunk. I'm drunk. 
 So? Kiss me anyway. 
 I am married. 
 So? 
 Kiss me anyway. 
 I can't. 
 Yes, you can. 
 You ... You're trouble. 
 You are trouble. 
 So? 
 Kiss me anyway. 
 ‚ô™ On my skin ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Winter came as a load ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Frozen down to the bone ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I lived here half asleep ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Walking nights to the road ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Empty, drunk, and alone ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ In hopes you'd come to me ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Before the morning ‚ô™ 
 No. 
 No. 
 ‚ô™ Where are you running? ‚ô™ 
 You've gotta fix this thing with Cristina and hunt. 
 Zola. Hey, Zola. 
 What? Don't tell me nothing's wrong. 
 Yang has never missed a day at work because she's been sick, ever. 
 And Sloan as chief? Oh ... He's driving me crazy. 
 I can't fix it. 
 Oh, come on. 
 I can't fix this. 
 He cheated on her. 
 What? 
 When? 
 I don't know. I don't know the whole story. 
 She didn't tell you? 
 No, he told me. 
 Hunt told you? 
 He told me, but he didn't really know he was telling me, but that's how I know. 
 Does Cristina know you know? 
 She knows. I mean, she doesn't know, but she knows. 
 I know she knows. 
 So don't you want to talk to her about it? 
 But I can't talk about it with her, because then we would be talking about it. 
 Don't you want to talk about it? 
 Yes, but not like that. 
 Well, I hope they figure it out. 
 Because you can't stand Sloan as your boss? 
 Among other things, yes. 
 Zola. 
 I'm gonna get you. 
 He does have a point about stabilizing the spine with foam. 
 Hey. I got your page. What's up? 
 Slight change of plans. 
 You're taking Sofia tonight. 
 Oh, yeah. We can't. 
 No, we got a ladies night with Altman. 
 You're taking Altman to a chick bar? 
 It can mean other things. 
 It's ... it's your night with Sofia. 
 I don't know how late I'm gonna have to be here tonight. 
 Oh, seriously? Seriously. 
 I have chief stuff to do. 
 And you still owe me for Valentine's day. 
 Kepner. 
 Here you go, doctor. Okay. 
 Remind me ... How long's it take to do an appy? 
 Well, if you, uh, perf the bowel, then ... Then it takes, uh, uh, it could take hours. 
 Or, uh, if ... if the patient hemorrhages, or if the patient ... this isn't your boards, Kepner. 
 How long does it take to do an appy ... In the real world? 
 45 minutes to an hour and 15, tops. 
 Then why do Bailey and Grey have eight hours blocked in O.R. two? 
 M-maybe it's a really complicated appy. 
 Kepner. 
 Kepner. 
 Dr. Webber was the chief for a really, really long time. 
 Do not touch that patient! 
 Oh, Dr. Sloan, if ... if you would just let us do our jobs ... I'm doing my job, Dr. Bailey. 
 And today my job is to be the chief of surgery, and as the chief of surgery, I told you not to perform this procedure. 
 So do not touch him. Take him back to his room. 
 Put him back on the transplant list. 
 See? 
 I told you this would never work. 
 Dr. Webber. 
 Chief Sloan. 
 Was I not clear this morning? 
 You mean this? 
 This is a benign adenoma. 
 I've been a general surgeon for almost 30 years. 
 I know a benign adenoma when I see one. 
 I'd stake my career on it. 
 If there's a tumor in the donor organs, then they've been compromised. 
 You know this. I didn't make those rules. 
 You're a good doctor, and you may one day make a great chief of surgery. 
 But you're a plastic surgeon, chief Sloan. 
 You're a perfectionist. 
 And you want everything by the rules so it'll end up pretty. 
 Well, I don't need pretty. 
 And I don't need perfect. 
 What I need is for this to work. 
 And what's gonna make it work is for me to take out that tumor and put these healthy organs inside my very sick patient. 
 It won't be pretty, but it will work, and it will keep my patient alive. 
 Stand down, chief Sloan. 
 Stand down. 
 A little more suction right here. 
 Cristina, please. 
 Open the door, please. 
 Cristina, if you don't open the door ... Are you okay? 
 Cristina ... Are you hurting yourself in there? 
 Cristina, please. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Cristina, if you don't open the door, I'm gonna have to break it in. 
 I'm gonna have to, so ... If you're all right, just open the door. 
 Okay, I'm breaking in the door. 
 So if you're close to the door, then just ... get back, 'cause I'm breaking it in right now. 
 I am. So ... All right. One ... Two ... Three. 
 Ahh. 
 Ouch. 
 Yeah, I p ... That was pretty lame. 
 I look like a total ... Cristina? 
 I-I have an M. D. and a PhD, I am a freaking cardiothoracic surgeon ... I-I am supposed to be studying for my boards ... the most important exam of my life, and I'm ... And I'm ... I'm ... I'm ... I'm locked in a bathroom crying ... Because of a boy. 
 I think it would be easier if she was someone you had fallen in love with. 
 No, it wouldn't have been easier. No, it would. 
 It would be clear ... and clean. 
 You would be leaving me for her. 
 You would've fallen out of love with me and in love with her. 
 When you slept with her, you wouldn't have been able to control yourself because of all the love. 
 Cristina, it would not have been easier. 
 It was just sex? 
 It was just sex. 
 Just once. 
 Oh, I don't understand. 
 What? What don't you ... I don't understand how you ... I don't understand ... Why you would sleep with another woman. 
 Cristina ... I don't know. 
 I-I ... I was ... lonely because we were fighting and ... I was afraid of what was happening to us, and I just got drunk and I did an incredibly stupid thing. 
 And I ... People make mistakes. 
 I make mistakes. You make mistakes. 
 Okay, if you're gonna ... Bring up the abortion again ... ohh. 
 If you're gonna say that you had sex with someone because I had an abortion ... I had sex with someone because I was hurt. 
 And you wanted to hurt me back? 
 I don't ... Cristina ... You wanted to hurt me back. 
 Oh, my God. You wanted to hurt me back. 
 Oh, Mark can't take Sofia tonight ... Or won't. 
 Well, he can't. 
 What are we gonna do? 
 Well, we could have ladies night at our place. 
 Um, just the two of us ... At home ... with Teddy? 
 Oh, I hate ladies night. 
 Well, it could be great if we could ditch Teddy. 
 Aw, that's so, so horrible. 
 Come on. We can do some salsa dancin'. 
 Mm. But do you think Teddy would understand? 
 Yeah, we'll reschedule. It's not like we're canceling. 
 Oh, are we bad people? We're bad ladies. 
 Maybe. 
 Maybe very bad. 
 Okay. 
 Out with the bad. 
 And in with the good. 
 On the count of three. 
 Ready. One, two ... careful ... And three. 
 Easy. Watch the clamps. 
 I have the clamps. I got 'em. 
 All right. Easy, easy, girl. 
 Okay. Okay. 
 So the beanbag will stabilize 
 Mr. Cooper's cervical spine. 
 And it's flexible enough that Dr. Warren can intubate and reposition if he needs to. 
 Once he intubates, I will leave the surgery to you. 
 A beanbag? 
 Well, inspiration can come from anywhere. 
 In this case ... day care. 
 You see that? 
 I plant the seed of innovation, I nurture it, and voila ... You rose. 
 Am I a fantastic leader or what? 
 All hail the chief. 
 When's hunt coming back? 
 Not soon enough. 
 Thank you, doctor. Hey. 
 Hey. Ooh. You okay? 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I just ... I just need some more coffee, I think. 
 Oh, well, listen, hey, if you're too tired, you know, we don't have to go out tonight. 
 You don't want to go out? 
 No, no, no, no. I mean, I didn't say that I don't ... wanna ... Oh, my God. When am I gonna stop freaking people out? 
 I-I-I don't mean to be the big, sad widow and I don't mean to bring the room down. 
 I-I don't want to ruin other people's fun ... Hey, Teddy, I'm just ... I-I 
 thought you were tired. 
 So we're super excited about ladies night out. 
 It's gonna be fun. Yeah? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Yay. Yay. 
 We are bad, selfish people. 
 A woman is counting on us. 
 She is leaning on us when she is feeling vulnerable and alone, and we are talking about dancing and getting it on and not even being halfway decent friends to her in her time of need. 
 Uh, you were gonna ditch her so you could get it on? 
 Where do you think we got the idea? 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Anyway, look, I only canceled because I knew the two of you would be there. 
 Now what's your excuse? 
 I wanted to salsa. 
 No, nobody gets salsa. 
 We get ladies night with Teddy. 
 And you will be there and you will be there. 
 Well, I have ... no excuses. 
 I thought Mark ... no excuses. 
 I read so much. There's so many charts. 
 I just got so full, I think things are falling out. 
 There's ... there's nothing in my brain. 
 Lexie, why aren't you in the reading room? 
 I can do it. 
 Okay. I can ... let me do ... No. No, no, no, you're not doing it. 
 But I ... no. No more using my sister like a database. 
 We broke her. 
 It's over. W ... Done. 
 Done. 
 ‚ô™ Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ From the perfect start ‚ô™ 
 So I'll come back and get the ... The rest of my stuff another time. 
 ‚ô™ And if you're still breathing ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ You're the lucky ones ‚ô™ 
 Okay. 
 ‚ô™ 'Cause most of us are heaving ‚ô™ 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 ‚ô™ Setting fire to our insides for fun ‚ô™ 
 I'll always be in love with you. 
 ‚ô™ To distract our hearts ‚ô™ 
 You're the love of my life. 
 I will never love another woman. 
 You don't even remember her name. 
 ‚ô™ And you caused it ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ And you caused it ‚ô™ 
 You take care of yourself. 
 ‚ô™ And you caused it ‚ô™ 
 Hi, Neil. 
 Am ... am I ... Alive? I'm afraid so. 
 Where is everybody? 
 You didn't tell anyone you were having surgery. 
 They didn't call just to check up on me? 
 You told them not to ... Several times. 
 What does that matter? 
 They're my family. 
 They should know not to listen to me. 
 I could've died. 
 They should've come. 
 I can't believe that they didn't come. 
 Well, let's call them. 
 Should we call them? 
 Yeah. Okay? 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Yeah. Okay. 
 Oh, I got those ginger cookies for dessert. 
 Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no dessert. 
 No, we're having a glass of wine, plate of food, then everybody's on their way. 
 School night. Ooh. 
 What'd you tell Ben, you'd be outta here in like an hour? 
 45 minutes. 
 I'm late. I'm sorry. 
 I-I just ... I couldn't figure out whether we wanted red or white or rose. 
 And then I realized, why choose? 
 I mean, we've got the whole night. 
 That we do. 
 And movies.""Dirty dancing"" and ""beaches."" 
 Oh! 
 Movies. 
 Cristina, are you there? 
 I can hear you breathing. Are you okay? 
 I'm here. 
 Are you feeling better? 
 Yes. 
 I'm better. I ... Cristina, um ... I know that you don't want to talk about it, but ... I'm here, so ... I just want to stay on the phone with you until you want to hang up. 
 I'm here. 
 I'm here. 
 The human body is made up of systems that keep it alive. 
 There's the one that keeps you breathing ... And the one that keeps you standing ... Hunt. 
 You feeling better? 
 What? 
 The flu. 
 Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Fine. 
 You mind if I join you? 
 Oh. Oh, yeah. Not at all. 
 You know, Sloan turned out to be a good chief. 
 Sloan? I-I asked for you or Webber if you wouldn't do it. 
 Sloan was chief? 
 Mark Sloan? 
 Yeah. He wasn't bad. 
 Don't let him know I said that, though. 
 The one that makes you hungry ... ‚ô™ All right ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I guess it's all all right ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I got nothing left ‚ô™ 
 And the one that makes you happy. 
 They're all connected. 
 Take a piece out ... And everything else falls apart. 
 So do you know why I brought you all here this morning? 
 To help you, because even though we all take the boards alone, if we work together, we can all pass. 
 And it's only when our support systems look like they might fail us ... ‚ô™ And say they're still alive ‚ô™ 
 If you're not at the hospital, you're here. 
 You sleep here, you eat here. 
 There are no distractions, no breaks. 
 This is the Grey method, and it starts now. 
 ‚ô™ I was surprised you stuck around ‚ô™ 
 That we realize how much we've depended on them all along. 
 ‚ô™ That it's all all right ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I guess it's all all right ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I got nothing left inside of my chest ‚ô™ 
 I'm gonna fail my boards. I need to study.

 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 Hey! I texted you. 
 Yeah, I saw that. I was busy. 
 Well, Cristina would've responded. 
 That's not how it works. 
 Not if she was doing what I was doing. 
 You pause. That's the rule. 
 What? If the text is urgent, Cristina would say to Owen, ""pause,"" and I would say to Derek, ""pause,"" then we'd text each other back. 
 - In the middle of sex? 
 If the the text is urgent. 
 The fact you are checking a text while you're doing it is already sad. 
 We had a special ringtone. 
 Hey, you want a special ringtone? 
 No. Wait, this pause thing...

 Pause. 
 No, I don't pause. Jo doesn't pause. 
 She fast-forwards and she rewinds, but she doesn't pause. 
 Okay, that's gross. 
 Do you wanna scrub in on my I.V.C. sarcoma? 
 Is it a kid? 
 No. 
 Then no. Why? 
 Because I want some company. 
 Get a resident. 
 I have a resident. 
 I want a grownup. 
 Bye. 
 Cristina would've scrubbed in. You're no good at this. 
 Bailey! 
 You wanna scrub in on my I.V.C. sarcoma? 
 Well, you don't need me for that. Don't you have a resident? 
 Residents are boring. All they wanna do is learn. 
 Come on. It's gonna be good. 
 It's all over the liver, hepatic vein. 
 It's gonna be bloody and gross. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 Does look like fun. 
 Page me when you're ready. See you in the O.R. 
 Adrian Nelson, 51. Presents with abdominal pain. 
 Scans show a leiomyosarcoma behind the liver, including the I.V.C. 
 What's the surgical plan? 
 Laparotomy to isolate the vessel, resect the tumor, and then replace with a graft. 
 It's a pretty straightforward procedure, Adrian. 
 I don't foresee any problems. 
 Could I ask you to... 
 I... It's silly. Never mind. 
 Meredith 
 : What is it? 
 She wants you to... to swear on the book. 
 [Horn honks in distance] 
 ""The odyssey."" 
 It's... it's the first book I ever sold Adrian. 
 The day we met. 
 Michael's a rare book vendor. 
 Our hands touched when I was ringing her up... 
 And it was... [Laughs] It was such a high. 
 It was electric. 
 We were both too shy to ask for a date. 
 So I wrote my number on a bookmark. 
 I saw it as soon as I got home, and then I called. 
 We've been together ever since. [Chuckles] 
 This book, it's... it's... it's our wedding ring. 
 Could you swear on the book, Dr. Grey, that you'll do your best? 
 It would mean so much. 
 [Telephone rings in distance] 
 Dr. Wilson, too. 
 Sure. 
 I swear. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 So Dr. Wilson will prep you, and I'll see you up there. 
 [Lowered voice] They're adorable. 
 They're weirdos. 
 Okay, you're gonna feel a little bit of pressure. 
 And this will tell us conclusively if the osteogenesis imperfecta is type II or III? 
 Yeah. 
 It's probably type III though, right? 
 I mean, so far there's been no indication of fetal distress. 
 Well, we'll know soon enough. 
 [Whooshing continues] 
 It'll be okay. O.I. type III, it's hard, sure, when there's surgeries and challenges, but we're surgeons. 
 We can... We can handle challenges, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I mean, we'll... 
 We'll still be able to give our baby a wonderful life. 
 Right? 
 Many type III babies live very, very happy lives. 
 Shouldn't Dr. Herman be doing this? 
 Mm, it's a very routine procedure. 
 Dr. Herman is the big g*n. 
 We only fire the big g*n when we need the big g*n. 
 I'm the little g*n, so... 
 [Whispers] Let the little g*n work. 
 [Whooshing continues] 
 Thank you so much. I know that took up a lot of your time. 
 I just wanna get all of the views with the thinnest cross sections I can get. 
 And I find that adorable. 
 You really think you can pull off your plan, huh? 
 I've got all your past medical records. 
 Once I get a firm grasp on the roads your other surgeons took to get to ""no,"" 
 I can cut away a clear path to ""yes."" 
 By the time I'm done with your tumor, I'm gonna be able to tell you what street this bastard grew up on and where it lost its virginity. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, you certainly are confident. 
 Thank you. 
 Or delusional. 
 One of the two. 
 It's hard to tell. 
 They look so similar. 
 So I think we need to talk about what we'll decide if it turns out the baby's type III. 
 I already told you, he won't be. 
 Yeah, I know that's what you believe. So do I, obviously. 
 But if he is type II, then it's so terrible... 
 I know. 
 And fatal... 
 [Sighs] 
 Usually. 
 All right? And before that, it's even worse. 
 I... I know all of this. I just... I don't wanna talk about it. 
 But we should talk about it. We need to talk about it. 
 W-why? Why can't we just wait until tomorrow? 
 Because we should have a plan. What do you mean? 
 Okay, well, uh, what do you wanna do? 
 That's what I'm saying. I think we should decide. 
 No, no. I'm... I'm... I'm asking what you want. 
 I want for us to figure this out together. 
 I don't... I don't think that's true. 
 I think that you already know what you would wanna do. 
 So... 
 What? 
 Just... yeah, just say it out loud. 
 Don't... 
 Right now. Well, what do you wanna do? 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 If our baby is type II, I... 
 I think we should terminate. 
 And I don't care whether our baby is type II or type III. 
 [Voice breaks] Either way, I wanna keep him. 
 Wh... April. 
 I told you I didn't wanna talk about this. 
 Jo 
 : Look at all these adhesions. 
 Miranda 
 : No way to see 'em coming. 
 Sneaky little bastards won't show up on the scan. 
 Meredith 
 : And there's more of them posteriorly, too. 
 I need some more exposure. 
 You're thinking of extending the incision? 
 I have to. I can't see what's up in there. 
 This tumor just keeps coming. 
 And all the landmarks are obscured. 
 I'm lost in here. It's like going in blind. 
 Hey, uh, would you bring those scans closer, please? 
 Man 
 : Yes, Doctor. 
 See, the tumor should be in the suprahepatic I.V.C. only. 
 Meredith 
 : That can't be right. 
 It doesn't show any further local invasion. 
 Show me the coronal view? 
 [Beep] 
 What's the tumor doing all the way over there? 
 That's what I want to know. 
 How old are these scans? 
 They're only two weeks old. 
 And they're completely outdated. 
 I mean, this thing is growing too fast. 
 Nothing is where it's supposed to be. 
 Tumor has extended to the I.V.C. tributaries. 
 Yeah, these scans are useless. 
 I can't see what I'm doing. 
 Oh, God. It's also spreading through the diaphragm. 
 Suction. 
 I can't even see where... 
 Neither can I. 
 Don't touch that. It's tearing. 
 Well, the tumor's extended all the way up between the lungs. 
 Someone page cardio! 
 It's all the way up into the pericardium. 
 Get the suction out. Don't touch it. Don't do anything. 
 Page... page cardio 9-1-1! 
 We gotta get out. Everybody out. Hands off. 
 What are we doing? What's going on? 
 Can someone say something? What are we doing? 
 It's spread from her major blood vessels to her liver, diaphragm, pericardium, maybe even her heart. 
 How can one tumor grow this big this fast? 
 It is everywhere. 
 It's a monster. 
 So what do we do? 
 I have no idea. 
 Meredith 
 : Michael, I'm afraid Adrian's tumor has grown considerably and it's now reaching around her heart. 
 So Dr. Pierce is here. 
 Her... her heart? 
 It's entangled through the vein that stretches up from her liver to her heart. 
 And it's growing more rapidly than anticipated. 
 So we need to take her for more MRI's so we can see how extensive the tumor's growth is. 
 Now there's all of you. 
 Three doctors. 
 [Voice breaks] Three is a lot. 
 Look, um, Odysseus didn't return to Ithaca all by himself. 
 He needed a lot of help, right, from the Phaeacians? 
 Well, we're the Phaeacians. 
 You want all the Phaeacians you can get. 
 We are going to figure this tumor out. 
 [Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.] 
 Oh. 
 Mmm! So light. 
 And it's last year's model. 
 We're weeks away from unveiling one that will weigh 30% less. 
 Mm. 
 Wow. Very impressive. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Your project is impressive. 
 Robotic limbs for injured vets? 
 Sexy as hell. 
 And we at Cybersystems are dying to climb into bed with you. 
 Well, that's very flattering. 
 Owen 
 : Mm-hmm. 
 Good. I want it to be. 
 [Elevator bell dings] 
 I'll leave you this folder so you can go over the materials. 
 I'll be in Seattle another day, so please, call me if you need... anything. 
 Thank you. Thank you for coming in. 
 So... [Sighs] What do you think? 
 I think you should definitely go for it. 
 Really? 
 'Cause I was not that impressed with these transducers. 
 What? No. 
 No, those... those things are crap. 
 I'm talking about her. 
 Her vibes? You didn't feel her vibes? 
 Major vibage for Major Hunt. 
 [Scoffs] You read that totally wrong. 
 Oh, please. 
 [Breathy voice] ""Your project's sexy as hell. 
 Ooh, ooh, let's climb into bed."" 
 I was actually uncomfortable. 
 Stop it! 
 [Giggles] 
 There you are. Where have you been? 
 I was performing a C.V.S. on April Kepner. 
 We're just waiting for the results. 
 [Whispers] God, I hate waiting. 
 In peds, it is... it's much easier. 
 You know, the parents are right there. 
 And... and you talk to them, and then their kid is right there, so they can hold them close and hope for the best. 
 The cat's on the roof. 
 With this, there's no kid to hold. 
 The problem feels so theoretical. 
 You know, there's no cat, there's no roof. 
 There's just two scared parents feeling totally helpless. 
 And you've had the results rushed? 
 [Sighs] Yeah. I should get them in, like, 24 hours. 
 Well, then there's nothing more to do about it today, which is good. 
 I have been working miracles. 
 I have found us the most incredible surgeries, all for the next few weeks. 
 Look, a T.T.T.S. in a 19-weeker. 
 A 21-week T.R.A.P. sequence that needs an R.F.A. 
 A unilateral pulmonary agenesis. 
 And that is just the beginning. 
 The beginning of what? 
 Your crash course. 
 I have hunted down the most screwed up, medically compromised fetuses that I could find, and I'm bringing them all here to this hospital for you to learn and us to save. 
 And you'll get to fix them all? 
 We will. 
 Start reading. 
 You can thank me later. 
 Mm. 
 And then... and this sounds crazy, I know, so don't even... 
 I'll... I'll build in a distribution of a radioactive seed during surgery, keeping Dr. Herman's tumor bed free of recurring cells. 
 I thought you were gonna use a laser. 
 I am. I already did. We're way past that. 
 Richard 
 : Try and keep up. 
 Uh, I'm sorry, Shepherd, but this is a great opportunity for them to learn. 
 I know. It's fine. 
 The laser is for ablating cells off the optic nerve... 
 It's a massive butterfly glioma. 
 Well, it's not just massive. I mean... 
 It's magnificent. 
 No, no, no. 
 I-I mean that, won't a laser take months? 
 A-again, uh, before that, I'll be using the ultrasonic surgical aspirator to mush and flush the cells, then the sexy laser and the... Yeah. 
 I'm sorry. I'm just lost. 
 Um, you were just talking about laser ablation. 
 So is that confined to the optic chiasm or will that extend... 
 Guys, step back. 
 Look at the whole big, beautiful, shapely thing. 
 Every part of this tumor's body will respond differently. 
 You will need a multitude of approaches. 
 You will have to be gentle with one part and rough with the other. 
 That is the only way she will respond. 
 Get it? 
 I don't see tumors the way she does. 
 [Clears throat] Didn't five surgeons say any one of these approaches would likely k*ll the patient? 
 Six. 
 But none of them tried it all at the same time. 
 It should work. 
 Maybe we should start over again from the beginning. 
 Okay. 
 I will begin with a, uh, bifrontal approach. 
 I-is that the right atrium? I can't tell. 
 Everything looks like mush. 
 Well, look at this angle right here. 
 Is that invading the right atrium? 
 I think that's a motion artifact. 
 Crap. 
 Adrian's back in her room. 
 Stable for now. How we doing here? 
 Has the cyclops revealed himself? 
 The cyclops? 
 Well, the patient's a fan of ""The Odyssey,"" so I'm calling the tumor the cyclops 'cause it's a big, ugly monster. 
 And I feel like I'm working with one eye because I can see it, but I can't get a sense of the whole thing. 
 Every view is incomplete. 
 Okay, what if we get a new set of scans, with contrast, this time with 3-D reconstruction? 
 Well, the woman's lying open in her bed. 
 We don't have time for a lot of trial and error. 
 I just wanna reach in and grab it. 
 Well, we could go in with these, but, yeah, I can't see. 
 If I could just hold it in my hand so that I could see it... 
 Holy crap. 
 What? 
 She's having an idea. 
 I already had it last year, and it's brilliant. 
 [Typing] We are going to print it. 
 The whole tumor. 
 I tried it with the portal veins, but it's not working. 
 But with this, we don't need it to function. 
 She's got a functioning tumor. 
 [Beep] We just need to be able to see it so we know how to k*ll it. 
 Know your enemy. 
 Is this gonna work? 
 It'll work. 
 Ooh, 2% left to upload. 
 This is how we beat this thing. 
 This is how we get visualization. 
 We are going to have a tangible, anatomically correct 3-D model of this exact tumor, and correlate to the adjacent organs... 
 Done! 
 Loaded! [Laughs] 
 [Printer whirring] 
 In 10 hours. 
 The longest documented surviving type II case that I could find lived for all of 18 months. 
 In an I.C.U. his entire life, hooked up to a feeding tubes and a ventilator. 
 That's not a life. 
 That's not a life I want for my son. 
 I... of c... neither do I. I... 
 Okay. So then how can you... 
 Because we don't know what will happen. 
 We don't even know if he's type II. 
 Okay, but what if he is? 
 [Whispers] Any amount of time that he survives... 
 Any amount of time that he lives will be... 
 Will be with us, in our arms... 
 Yes. 
 Knowing that he's loved and wanted. 
 And his bones can break if you touch him. 
 His bones can break if we're changing his diaper. 
 We're doctors. We can handle it. 
 If... if anyone can handle it, we can. 
 I'm not saying we can't handle it. 
 I'm asking if we should. 
 Yeah, we're doctors. 
 Maybe we are better equipped to make an educated decision here. 
 And maybe we were given this baby for a reason. 
 Karen 
 : April. 
 [Sighs] 
 You called your mom. 
 Yeah. People need their mom in a crisis. 
 No, not everybody does. 
 I came as soon as I got your call, sweetie. 
 It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. 
 I'm here. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Are you working today? 
 No. 
 Then let's get out of here. 
 You could use a change of scenery. 
 That's actually a really good idea. We should take the day, go somewhere nice, maybe drive to the ocean. 
 Let's go to church. 
 You'll find comfort there. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 Yeah, go ahead. 
 Let's go pray. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 [Monitor beeping steadily] 
 She is doing fine. 
 Those chairs will k*ll your back. 
 You should go home and get some rest. 
 I-I can't. 
 I-I can't go home alone when she's like this. 
 Thought I'd just stay and read. 
 Okay. That's fine. [Gloves snap] 
 But I can't read either. 
 Can't concentrate. 
 It's odd. I-I've... I've never had that problem. 
 I think it's because... 
 I don't know where she is. 
 I-I always know where she is. 
 Well, she's right here. 
 It's just as if she's asleep in the bed next to you. 
 Not really. 
 [Voice breaks] Because she might not wake up. 
 I feel like... 
 Like she's sailed away and I don't know if she's coming back. 
 That's the feeling, you know? 
 Michael, we are working very hard to solve this. 
 I know. 
 I know. I just... 
 I just want her to come back. 
 I do, too. 
 This H.L.H.S. case seems impossible. 
 Mother's pregnant for the third time, and each baby was stillborn. 
 Well, this one will be, too. 
 22Q11 deletion? 
 She should adopt. 
 [Folder clatters] 
 Now this one, however... 
 Tracheal balloon occlusion for C.D.H.? 
 Card that puppy. 
 How do you do this without... I mean, these stories are awful. 
 They're patients, Robbins. 
 The more you find, the more you learn, the more we save. 
 It's as simple as that. 
 Your work is making these three categories... 
 Possible, impossible, maybe. 
 Any other approach is a waste of our time. 
 [Exhales deeply] 
 Kat Dahlia: ‚ô™ Think that Cupid's up to something ‚ô™ 
 Ahh. [Clink] 
 [Chuckles] 
 [Chuckles] 
 Oh, wow. 
 ‚ô™ But lately color seem so bright ‚ô™ 
 Holy crap. 
 [Gasps] It's fate! 
 Look! It's your sexy tech rep! 
 [High-pitched voice] Your sexy tech rep! 
 She... she's not my sexy anything. 
 Not yet, but she could be. 
 [Laughs] I came out tonight with you to... to unwind, not to... 
 And she's a... she's a tech rep. That's a conflict of interest. 
 Not if we don't buy her transducers. 
 Mm. 
 They're junk, anyway. 
 Come on! You gotta get back in the saddle. 
 And she's got a nice saddle. 
 Oh, yeah. [Chuckles] 
 [Glass thuds] 
 What? Whoa. Whoa. What are you doing? 
 Ahh. 
 Okay, so listen, I'm not, uh, really great at this kind of thing, so I'm just gonna blurt it out. 
 I think that you were interested in more than just our program today. 
 Oh, you picked up on that? 
 I was right! Ha ha ha! 
 I knew it! Okay. So this should be easy. 
 Owen is a little bit shy, but he's a great guy. 
 And, uh... The feeling's mutual. 
 So... 
 [Chuckles] So what do you say? 
 I would say that there's something about him that doesn't quite... feel like he's my type. 
 What?! No! He's... [Laughs] 
 He's very attractive. He's nice. He's funny. 
 People like funny, right? I mean, come on. Give him a chance. 
 What about him isn't your type? 
 He has a penis. 
 [Door bell jingles] 
 [Laughs] Oh! 
 [Chuckles] Ohh. 
 Oh. 
 Wait. No. You were... [Sighs] You... you were flirty. 
 I was, but not with him. 
 ‚ô™ Again ‚ô™ 
 Oh. 
 [Chuckles nervously] 
 Um... 
 Wow. 
 I am wildly saddened by my, uh, intense... [Laughs] Lack of game right now. 
 I can't believe I didn't see that coming. 
 I... there was a time when I would've been all, ""that's right. I know it's me."" 
 But right now, I'm just like, uh, ""uh... "" [Laughs] 'Cause, uh, you looking at me like that... [Inhales deeply] You are gorgeous, by the way. 
 Uh... Do people just tell you that all the time? 
 [Laughing] 
 Because you are gorgeous. 
 I'm not. 
 Am I? 
 No. 
 Am I? 
 No. Wait. No, no. Wait, wait. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 Not into women? 
 No, no, no. I am, totally. 
 Women. Men. People, really. 
 I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just not really shopping right now. 
 I'm... I'm divorced. 
 And it's... [Chuckles] Was recent and painful and brutal. 
 Brutal, actually. 
 Well, if you wanna forget for just a little while, I fly out tomorrow. 
 Doesn't have to be anything more than one night. 
 I would love... 
 I would love to love that. I'm just not ready. 
 I'm... I'm so sorry. 
 ‚ô™ I think I'm in love ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I think I'm in love ‚ô™ 
 W... 
 ‚ô™ again ‚ô™ 
 [Knocks on door] 
 Hi, guys. 
 Hey. 
 You're here late. 
 Well, we're on a timeline. 
 I, uh, was taking a look at Dr. Wall's notes, and I found some contradictory information. 
 He was the second opinion? 
 Wall is where? 
 Case Western. 
 Uh, he was third. 
 Mm. He's radiation. 
 Right. Just getting my dates straight. 
 What are all these? 
 Cases. Fetuses. 
 Each card represents a fetus that I'm gonna teach Robbins how to fix. 
 That I... estimate we can get to in the time I have. 
 - And those? 
 Uh, these? 
 No. These are the ones that I could save, 
 uh, if I had time. 
 You should just think of them as babies who will die if it turns out that you're full of crap and can't take out my tumor. 
 Ah. No pressure. 
 Oh, no. Pressure. 
 We're... we're on a timeline here, right? 
 Try being me. 
 Okay. [Chuckles] 
 Woman 
 : Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery. 
 Dr. Meadows, labor and delivery. 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Door opens and closes] 
 Oh, good! You're home! 
 Just in time for dinner. 
 Smells good. 
 How was church? 
 [Gasps] The choir was there, practicing for their service tomorrow night. 
 Really beautiful. We should all go to it. 
 Ah, I don't think we'll know what we'll be up for tomorrow, Karen. 
 Because of the test results? 
 April told me about the test, and I told her there's really no point in even getting those results. 
 Excuse me? 
 God gives what he wants to give. 
 No test is going to change that. 
 And April's already so upset, so stressed. 
 It's not good for the baby. 
 Just focus on loving that sweet little baby. 
 That's all that matters. 
 No, that's definitely not all that matters. 
 I know. It's hard to understand sometimes how His plan will unfold. 
 Yeah, but I'm not worried about His plan, am I? 
 I'm worried about our plan. 
 He never gives us more than we can handle. 
 Getting the results, being informed about our baby's condition... that's how we handle it. 
 I called our pastor at home. 
 April spoke to him at length. He was very helpful. 
 April. 
 Me. Let me help you. 
 [Sighs] Whatever happens, we will shoulder the burden 
 - when it is placed upon us. 
 We will. 
 You and I. We'll shoulder the burden. 
 She's just trying to help. 
 Is she, though? Really? Is she helping? 
 Don't snap at her. 
 Don't talk to her in that tone. 
 What tone? 
 I'm not talking using a tone. I'm trying to understand. 
 You're trying to talk my little girl into doing something she knows in her heart and soul she does not want to do. 
 I'm not trying to talk her into anything. 
 I'm supporting her in trying to make the best choice possible 
 for our baby, for her, for our family. 
 This is between April and her God. 
 [Scoffs] Okay. 
 And if you think she is going to agree 
 - to abort her child... 
 Our child! 
 You are... 
 Get that straight. It's our child. 
 Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
 None of this is helping! 
 You are not helping, neither of you. 
 I am standing here, listening to you tell me that God only gives me one choice, and you telling me that I should forgo God's choice. 
 And the truth is, I don't know anything expect that I am scared and sad and I'm alone. 
 You're both just standing there, yelling at each other and talking at me, 
 but I am alone, and it is terrifying! 
 And the louder you get, the more terrified I become, 
 so I just need you both to just shut up! 
 Can you... Can you do that? 
 Can you please... can you please both just shut up? 
 [Exhales shakily] 
 [Siren wailing] 
 [Printer continues whirring] 
 What are you guys still doing here? 
 We're solving a tumor by 3-D printing it. 
 [Sighs] Yeah. 
 What are you still doing here? 
 Also solving a tumor. 
 Maybe you should 3-D print your tumor. 
 [Sighs] Visibility is not my problem. 
 I can see my tumor in all its problematic glory, and it's giving me the middle finger in front of Richard Webber and a bunch of residents. 
 Where are the kids? 
 Upstairs. 
 Daycare. Nightcare. Whatever care. 
 It's open 24 hours. 
 You know that's only for surgeons on call, right? 
 Bailey, don't judge me. Derek lives in D.C. 
 No, I'm saying if they ask you, make up something about being on call. 
 When I had my genome lab, I was on call twice a week. 
 You all realize that printing this thing is gonna take, like, five more hours? 
 7-ish. 
 7 hours and 20 minutes. 
 7 and a half. 
 I'm just saying you could go home, sleep, and then come back. 
 Someone has to stay in case the printer crashes. 
 [Whirring continues] 
 Plus, I don't mind. I like the sound. 
 It's kinda soothing. 
 [Sighs] 
 It feels weird to sleep alone. 
 I'm not used to it. I don't know why. 
 He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's... 
 He's gone, and I know he's gone. 
 And the bed feels lonely. 
 It's like I don't know how to sleep alone. 
 You don't. 
 I mean, before three months ago, any time I called your house or came over or skyped or whatever, Cristina was there. 
 There's no way you ever slept alone. I mean, you had Derek. 
 And if you didn't have Derek, you had Cristina. 
 I'm guessing if it came down to it, you were, like, the middle spoon in the middle of a very weird spooning situation. 
 I've never met a less alone person than you used... 
 Used to be. 
 I have to learn to sleep alone. 
 Ben snores. 
 And he sometimes talks in his sleep. 
 And he's hot. 
 Like... a furnace. 
 Like flames sh**t' out of him. 
 He's lucky I love him. 
 And he's a resident and hardly home at night. 
 Or he'd be dead. 
 Woman 
 : ‚ô™ I will be your... ‚ô™ 
 I miss sleeping with a man in my bed. 
 You know, facing away from each other, barely touching expect for just the arm thrown over your waist. 
 When I'd wake up at night, terrified of... me, I liked knowing he was there and I wasn't by myself. 
 ‚ô™ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 [Sighs] 
 I cannot sleep with someone lying next to me. 
 Literally cannot. 
 My one serious guy? Dean. 
 Dean just loved to spoon and snuggle, and I would just... lie there, [Laughs] 
 Staring up silently, counting the seconds until he would fall asleep and I could sneak off to sleep on the sofa. 
 And then I'd sneak back into bed before he woke up in the morning. 
 [Giggles] 
 Yeah, people think that's a cute story. It's not a cute story. 
 That sofa was hard as a rock. I was exhausted. 
 Dean is a really sweet guy. 
 He's tall and kind. 
 Civil rights lawyer. 
 He's funny. 
 So when he proposed, I explained to him about the sleeping. 
 I said, ""you know, maybe you could sleep in a room down the hall."" 
 I wanted to sleep alone. 
 And what happened? 
 Well, he is now married to someone who loves to spoon and snuggle. 
 [Chuckles] 
 And I sleep like a baby every night. 
 I might be too good at being alone. 
 [Sighs] 
 ‚ô™ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Let the light back in ‚ô™ 
 Maybe I could... [sighs] print a Derek. 
 [Whirring continues] 
 Just for sleeping. 
 ‚ô™ Ooh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Let the light back in ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 [Crickets chirping] 
 Hey, move your butts. 
 [Chuckles] 
 Hello again, cyclops. 
 Jo 
 : It is crazy cool amazing. 
 It could not be more amazing. 
 Okay, hit me. What's next? 
 I think we can divide the diaphragm to resect the pericardial component of the tumor. 
 Maggie 
 : But carefully. 
 We'll need to dissect 2 to 3 centimeters proximal to the I.V.C. first to control flow. 
 Yep, and then we can clamp and create the veno-venous bypass flap. 
 You sure you don't wanna do a sternotomy? 
 Now you have something to say? Where were you yesterday? 
 You should've showed me this. 
 Karev, what's your point? 
 Well... [Sighs] I would do McGinn's technique to access the chest with less invasiveness to avoid diaphragmatic hernia postradiation. 
 [Sighs] 
 He's got a point. 
 Back to the beginning. 
 [Indistinct conversations] 
 ‚ô™ 
 Meredith 
 : Okay, so feel this right here. 
 Okay, that's... What? 
 Like, 5 centimeters superior to the renal vein? 
 Okay, but stop. 
 Close your eyes and just feel. 
 Okay. 
 Because all we have to go on is muscle memory. 
 Um, it's... 2 fingerbreadths from the confluence of the hepatic veins. 
 And then we anastomose the bifurcated graft. 
 Bailey? 
 Yeah. 
 Write that up. 
 ‚ô™ 
 You're their board bitch. 
 You're jealous, aren't you? 
 No. 
 A little. 
 Wilson! 
 Oh, yeah. Uh, on it. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Okay, my finger is in the foramen of Winslow. 
 Bailey, can you feel me? 
 Yeah, I'm right behind you. 
 I can feel the edge of the lesser omentum. 
 I think that gives me enough space to control the porta hepatis. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yes. Yes. I can palpate a good window. 
 Good. That works. 
 [Cell phone chimes and vibrates] 
 No. 
 All right, what next? 
 There is no next. 
 The wound-V.A.C. has frank blood. 
 She's bleeding. We have to get her up to the O.R. 
 You need an extra set of hands? 
 Yes. Wilson's. 
 Take that white board. Bring it up where everyone can see it. 
 We haven't even gotten to the retroperitoneal dissection yet. 
 We will when we get up there. We'll figure it out as we go. 
 You are coming with me. 
 I'm into the retrohepatic area. More suction. 
 Jo 
 : Okay, then you're on to step two. 
 Step two... access the pericardial I.V.C. 
 Bailey, a little more retraction? 
 Okay, I'm at the pericardium. 
 Well, it branches 2 centimeters in either direction, so you're close. 
 Damn it. Adhesions here, too. 
 Meredith 
 : There's too much blood. Suction! 
 I need to do a partial resection of the liver, but I just can't see to do it. [Suction gurgling] 
 Same problem up here. Can I get some more suction, please? 
 Should we control the hepatic veins and resect part of the liver? 
 I'm trying. 
 I think that's the only way. But without visibility, I might hit a major vessel. 
 Pierce? 
 I can't see the field. 
 Yeah, I can't see anything. 
 Crap. They're drowning. 
 I'm not sure the model's gonna help them. 
 It's not telling them any more than the scans did. 
 And they still can't see enough to... 
 The model is how they'll see, 
 without adhesions and bleeding in the way. 
 How the pieces relate to her anatomy. 
 It's the big picture. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I get it. 
 You're welcome. 
 [Sighs deeply] 
 How's it coming? 
 You know, by millimeters. 
 Your notebook-wielding minions got bored and ditched me for another tumor. 
 Well, I thought you might need this. 
 Are you keeping tabs on me? 
 Is that what's happening? 
 No. Why would you say that? 
 Because you might be worried about me, and that I... [Inhales deeply] 
 Have decided I can do something that cannot be done just so that I can prove that I am okay and that I deserve to be here. 
 That I'm overreaching. 
 Should I be keeping tabs on you? 
 [Scoffs] I mean, you saw the look on those residents' faces yesterday. 
 They think that I am certifiable. 
 And... [Laughs] Why shouldn't they? 
 Why should I think that I can do this? 
 Why shouldn't I think that I'm gonna k*ll this woman and all those little babies with her? 
 You are not doing that. 
 Nobody thinks that this can work. 
 No one understands it. 
 You were talking way over those residents' heads. 
 And you think so fast it made my eyes spin. 
 But you have a plan. 
 And just because you're the only one that can see the endgame doesn't mean that you're wrong. 
 It just means it's lonely. 
 And scary. 
 You'd be a fool if you weren't scared. 
 [Blows air] 
 I'm gonna leave you be. 
 Ugh. Don't. Then I'll be alone with this thing. 
 [Inhales deeply] 
 What you were talking about yesterday... 
 The whole big, beautiful body? 
 Um, I think I get it. 
 I think. 
 So you do the fluoroscein first. 
 Tell me why. 
 So you can keep an eye on the pituitary stalk even though you're nowhere near it. 
 Because? 
 Because... 
 You want to appreciate the whole thing at once. 
 Right? 
 Yes. 
 Thank you. 
 You can go now.

 What's next? 
 Okay, you just controlled the lower end of the tumor, so... 
 [Suction gurgling] 
 That's as far as you got. That's the last step. 
 [Sighs] 
 Okay, so next we... 
 Dissect around the diaphragm. 
 Finish my dissection retroperitoneally. 
 Uh, that's... 
 Two ways to go. 
 [Monitor beeping rapidly] Her heart can't handle all the clamping. 
 Whatever we do, we have to do it now. 
 You mean cut blind? 
 No. Wait. Jo, bring the cyclops over here. 
 On it. 
 Bring it over here, hold it up, turn it slowly. 
 Okay, so we're gonna anastomose the graft to the lower end. 
 And then I'll start from the upper end, yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Find me. 
 I am at the diaphragm. 
 6-0 prolene and graft stat. 
 I'm on top of the right hepatic vein. 
 This is where we cut, right here. 
 That's my finger. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 No, it's, uh... 
 Got it. Here. It extends 10 cm off where the veins meet. 
 Right? This is it. This is it right here. 
 This is where we cut right here. 
 How much do you trust that thing? 
 I'll let you know in a second. Metz.

 You know, I-I... I appreciate a girl with fire in her belly, but... 
 I didn't have a better life. 
 I wasn't better off. 
 No one found me adoring parents who were dying for a newborn of their own to love. 
 I lived in foster homes so bad, it was better to live in my car. 
 And when a man finally told me that he loved me, I believed him, even when he beat the crap out of me so bad I couldn't see.

 I'm not reporting anything.

 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
 You never told anyone. 
 The police, your parents... 
 I convinced the few people who noticed that it was just the freshman   , and I was able to dodge Christmas break by lying about... finals and work studies. 
 You didn't tell anyone you were pregnant? 
 No, no. 
 I mean, it... it wasn't until years after it happened that... 
 After 
 I 
 happened. 
 After the r*pe happened. 
 After I was r*ped. 
 I eventually found my way to therapy, and I did all the work, and I wrote in journals, and I learned all the PTSD triggers. 
 I-I actually had to work through calling it ""r*pe"" to begin with. 
 Because I did say yes to that date, and I did say yes to getting in that car, and... 
 Someone somewhere along the way... a man, most likely... 
 decided they wanted to qualify this word, ""r*pe."" 
 You know, date r*pe, 
 [SNIFFLES] a-acquaintance r*pe. 
 Somehow, it... it... it... it's... it's not as real unless it happens to a woman who's running through the park at night or... or walking down a dark alley. 
 As somehow, because I knew him, what he took from me didn't matter. 
 But it did matter. 
 I found a way to hear that. 
 I found a way to believe that. 
 And I... 
 I found a way to move forward. 
 You got therapy. 
 Yeah. 
 You moved forward. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And you didn't once try and find me? 
 I was petrified. 
 I was petrified every single moment of my pregnancy. 
 I mean, it was bad enough that I had to see his face every day in class. 
 I was so terrified... imagining that you'd be a boy and that you'd have his face and his voice. 
 And every day, every kick, every movement, it just reminded me where you came from. 
 But, you know, movies and books and... and magazines, they just kept talking about this...love that you feel the minute your baby is born. 
 How instantaneous it is and how, um, your heart just cracks wide open, and... 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 And I remember, I kept telling myself that as soon as I had you in my arms that I could do that and that I would do that. 
 Other women did it, so why couldn't I? 
 So I gave the hospital a fake name. 
 I left with you... the day you were born. 
 I remember they wanted me to stay, and they wanted me to rest, but I just wanted to get out. 
 I just wanted to get out of there, and I just wanted... 
 [VOICE BREAKING] I just wanted to be alone with you, and I just wanted it to be the two of us, and... 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 ...and I wanted to stare at you and hold you... 
 ...'til that love came. 
 But it never did. 
 No, it did. 
 It did. 
 Everything they said was absolutely right. 
 My heart cracked wide open. 
 [CRYING] 
 It was never just us, no matter how hard I tried, no matter what I did. 
 I was just a reminder of him. 
 I resented you so much for it. 
 I spent most of my life... doubting everyone I ever met, leaving them before they could leave me. 
 I am a grown woman 
 [SIGHS] 
 With a job that I love and friends I love and a husband who loves me, and still... 
 still... 
 I was walking around, uh, waiting, wondering if you would ever find me. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 If you would ever say that you're sorry. 
 I did the best I could. 
 The best you could would've been to find an adoption agency and make sure I had a home and someone to love me, not toss me away like garbage. 
 It is so easy to look at me now and think of all the ways that I could've been kinder, better, or smarter, but... 
 ...I was not the person I am today. 
 I was not in my right mind. 
 I wasn't in my mind at all. 
 That night that... that he held me down, screaming. 
 That night that he had his hands around my throat until I stopped screaming, when I was hovering over my own body while he was tearing away at me, that night that he smiled and he forced me to say that I liked it, when he laughed and... 
 ...promised that we could do it any time that I wanted to... 
 ...that was the night that I lost my right mind. 
 He stole it from me, and for nine months... for nine months, I pretended I was fine. 
 I pretended that I wasn't a zombie, that I wasn't numb or dead inside. 
 And then, the day that you were born, I held you, and I looked at your face, and I... 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 ...I could feel again for the first time, but... 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 ...my mind... 
 ...that took years to come back. 
 In fact, I'm... Part of it never did. 
 Of course you deserved better. 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 I didn't have better to give you. 
 I was seven weeks pregnant when my ex-husband cracked my ribs and threw me across the living room floor. 
 He didn't know that I was pregnant, and I decided in that moment that he could never know. 
 I couldn't... I couldn't see a way out. 
 Not then, at least. 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
 I knew that, if I tried to leave, he would k*ll me. 
 But I also knew that I couldn't raise a kid in that... fear, and in that danger. 
 You had an abortion. 
 I've never told anyone that. 
 I don't know why. I'm not ashamed of it. 
 I...

 Um, and I lose my breath sometimes when I walk my dog. 
 These scans are three weeks old. 
 Why did you wait so long to come? 
 My doctor said it could be some time before it got really bad. 
 And news like this, it takes a minute to process. 
 And Dad wanted to go up to Chicago, but I wanted to come here. 
 I'm glad you agreed. 
 I didn't want her traveling alone. 
 Okay, Sabrina, this kind of - Sabi, please. 
 - Okay. 
 Sabi. 
 This kind of tumor is operable, but it can grow really rapidly, so we need to get some new imaging right away. 
 It was really dumb of me to wait, wasn't it? 
 Let's, uh Let's go get those scans. 
 Was your dad home when your mom fell? 
 I don't have a dad. 
 I came home from school on the bus, and Mom was in the basement o-o-on the floor. 
 She couldn't move. 
 Is she gonna be okay? 
 She has got a really great team of doctors taking care of her. 
 Here. 
 Maybe holding this guy will make you feel better. 
 I'm so sorry about this wait. 
 Do you want to sit down? 
 No, no. 
 I'm okay now. 
 Minute you start acting sick, that's when you really get sick. 
 So what's the tea? 
 - You know what tea is, right? 
 - Yeah, no, I do. 
 I just, uh I mostly work. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 There's nothing? 
 No scandal? 
 No love life?! 
 Uh, my ex-boyfriend rebounded with a firefighter? 
 Gay? 
 Hot chick. 
 Okay, then. 
 I hate him. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 - We're family. 
 I've got you. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 I hope he wakes up tomorrow, realizes what a mistake he made, but it's too late because you're with Idris Elba. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Oh, girl. 
 - Mm-hmm! 
 - [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 Girl, gimme your phone. 
 You need my number. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - Here. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 Mm. 
 Hey, do you like crossword puzzles? 
 Love 'em. 
 Acrostics, Sudoku, but crosswords are the best. 
 I only do the ones on the weekends, though, - because the other ones are - TOGETHER: too easy. 
 - Right?! 
 I get so bored! 
 - [LAUGHING] 
 I know. 
 We have so much shared DNA, I bet we have a ton in common. 
 - Do you like classical music? 
 - Love it. 
 - Can you whistle? 
 - Yes! 
 I know that's not necessarily, like, a genetic thing Um they're, uh they're ready for you. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 Okay. 
 - To be continued Cuz! 
 - Yeah. 
 [MAGGIE AND SABRINA LAUGH]

 [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 This thing smells new. 
 Am I the first person in it? 
 Close to it. 
 Hold still now. 
 [SCANNER WHIRRING] 
 I can't imagine how strange this must be for you. 
 - I'm sorry I didn't tell you - Oh, are you kidding?! 
 It is fascinating. 
 And, yes, it's really, really strange. 
 I've never had a relative who looked like me before. 
 And she's just been out there practically my entire life, - just having different experiences. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 I wonder if we've ever been in the same town at the same time before today. 
 I was in Dayton once. 
 I had a long layover. 
 I went to the mall. 
 Has it really been five years since you saw each other? 
 Uh Sabi's not like the others. 
 My brother and sister always resented me for leaving, resented my success. 
 Accused me of putting on airs and acting like I was better. 
 Adele always had a way of smoothing things over. 
 I should've tried harder after she died. 
 And they didn't know about me until the podcast. 
 When I called to tell them, they, uh, said some vicious things, and I think I just wanted to protect you from that. 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 But it's, uh, it's nice to see the two of you get along so well. 
 [BEEPS] 
 Oh, God. 
 The tumor's reaching up through the tricuspid valve and into her pulmonary artery now. 
 I think it's doubled in size. 
 This might be the biggest heart tumor I have ever seen. 
 Is somebody gonna get me out of this thing or what? 
 FAST exam shows the free fluid on the perisplenic space. 
 Ma'am, did you have any symptoms before you fell? 
 I-I was bringing the laundry upstairs, and I got really dizzy. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Wait, you see that? 
 Excess fluid? 
 That's a heartbeat. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 Ma'am Ma'am, did you know that you were pregnant? 
 Was or am? 
 [HEART BEATING] 
 We have a strong heartbeat. 
 Your baby's okay. 
 Okay? 
 [WHISPERING] 
 It didn't work. 
 What What didn't? 
 I can't have another baby. 
 I can't.

 Jeanette Brody to Admitting. 
 - Hey. 
 Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 How's Mom? 
 She's, um [WHISPERING] 
 Listen, her fall wasn't an accident. 
 She was trying to terminate a pregnancy. 
 By throwing herself down the stairs? 
 I don't know. 
 She's not talking much Well, do you want me to try? 
 She might be more comfortable talking to another woman. 
 I can say it's a neuro check. 
 Sure, might help. 
 I already paged psych, but they take forever around here, so - How pregnant is she? 
 - 8, 10 weeks. 
 I'm not sure. 
 Uh, if you're not up to this, then I can get someone else, you know. 
 Why wouldn't I feel up to it? 
 [TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE] 
 Because I'm all knocked up? 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 - It's okay, Owen. 
 I don't need a fainting couch. 
 I will be fine. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Thank you. 
 [TELEPHONE RINGS IN DISTANCE] 
 [BEEPING] 
 - That's the same tumor? 
 - Yes. 
 And now it's extending into your pulmonary artery. 
 Looks kinda like a baby swan with that little neck. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - Sabi this tumor isn't stable. 
 It could stop your heart's ability to pump blood. 
 We need to get you up to surgery. 
 Today. 
 - Well, who's gonna do it? 
 - You're in luck. 
 This happens to be my specialty. 
 You? 
 But you don't work here. 
 They granted me privileges, so we're good to go. 
 SABI: But we're family. 
 And we're basically twins. 
 I mean, What if you see me lying on that operating table, and you freak out because it's you on the table? 
 MAGGIE: That is not a thing I do. 
 And I'm the best. 
 Then get second best. 
 Sabi, she won't even be able to see your face. 
 It's covered during surgery. 
 Okay, that is really creepy. 
 Do people know that? 
 I-Isn't there a law against operating on family? 
 It isn't a law. 
 It's a guideline. 
 And since we've only known each other about two hours, I'm not really sure how it applies here. 
 Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. 
 - Excuse me? 
 - You're steamrolling her, thinking you know what's best. 
 You're not even listening to her concerns. 
 I'm listening. 
 They're just not valid. 
 Not valid? 
 We look alike, we have some things in common, but we're we're not family. 
 Not in the way that matters. 
 I am the best cardiothoracic surgeon in the Northwest. 
 I run my department. 
 I innovate. 
 You want me in that room. 
 What makes you think you know what she wants? 
 - You don't even know her. 
 - Which is why I can do this! 
 Richard? 
 A little support, please? 
 Um you know, I don't trust the cardio surgeon who's here today. 
 Thank you. 
 So I am your only option. 
 But, um there is an on-call surgeon who's quite good. 
 I'll, um I'll make a call. 
 Thank you. 
 Took you long enough. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Maggie. 
 Um, will you, uh, stick around and brief the surgeon? 
 Maybe consult? 
 You want me to consult for someone who's not as good as me instead of giving your niece the best shot she's got? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Maggie, they're family. 
 So you're just gonna agree with them because of some bad history with your brother? 
 No, that's not what I meant. 
 Look, they're your family, too. 
 I know you just met and it may not feel that way, but they look, one day, it could. 
 And God forbid something goes wrong in the OR and I'll always be the love child who k*lled your favorite niece? 
 Oh, come on, now. 
 You'll never get a chance to know them. 
 And I never would've known they existed if they hadn't come here. 
 Richard, your niece came here for help as a doctor. 
 It's too bad you can't do her the favor of thinking like one. 
 Yes, I'll consult. 
 Text me when he's here. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 No sign of concussion. 
 How's Henry? 
 Is he scared? 
 Henry is over the moon. 
 A very sweet nurse showed him the snack drawer. 
 OWEN: Cassidy, the CT shows that there is some bleeding in your spleen. 
 We're gonna have to take you up to the OR to remove it, and I can do that laparoscopically. 
 I-I don't have insurance right now. 
 Henry just qualified for a state program, but I'm still waiting to hear. 
 Emergency departments don't turn people away, regardless of their financial situation, so they will give you the surgery that you need, okay? 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 But surgery, uh, will put the fetus at risk, so, I have to ask you Are you planning on keeping this pregnancy? 
 I love Henry. 
 But it's a lot. 
 I already work at two restaurants, and they try to give me a flexible schedule, but there's only so much that they can do. 
 And another kid I mean, that's way more money, and and even more time away from Henry. 
 I can't I can't and I don't want to. 
 So you threw yourself down the stairs? 
 What?! 
 Oh, my God, no! 
 No, I tried to go to a clinic that had financial assistance three times, but something always fell through. 
 Henry got sick or no one could sub for me. 
 I-I ran out of favors. 
 So I looked online, and I found this herb that was supposed to work. 
 I-I doubled the recipe to make sure it would work, but it made me dizzy. 
 And then I fell. 
 I just fell. 
 I love my son. 
 And I would never do anything to try to hurt myself. 
 I would never do anything to try to hurt him. 
 Okay, Cassidy, listen. 
 You are okay right now. 
 And Henry is okay. 
 And if you want an abortion, Dr. 
 Hunt can get someone from OB to do that during your surgery once the bleeding in your abdomen is under control. 
 Oh, God, really? 
 Thank you. 
 - Thank you so much - Um, actually, Cassidy, I think we want to focus on the fall injuries first. 
 Okay? 
 We can address the pregnancy once we know that you're all right. 
 Oh. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, so, we'll see you up in the OR shortly. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 - What are you doing? 
 - You really overstepped in there. 
 I'm a trauma surgeon. 
 I don't order abortions. 
 You would have if the fetus hadn't survived. 
 But it did. 
 Owen, she's eight weeks. 
 She doesn't need a full D&C. 
 Exactly. 
 It's not emergent, but her internal injuries are. 
 So I'm gonna deal with those, and then she can go see an OB. 
 She seems pretty clear in her thinking and committed to her plan. 
 Why not just give her the help she's asking for? 
 Thank you, Amelia, for your consult, but I'm gonna take it from here, okay? 
 - [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] 
 - [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
 Hey. 
 - What are you doing here? 
 - In the neighborhood. 
 Lunch break. 
 Having coffee with Alex. 
 What are you doing in enemy territory? 
 Wow. 
 That's a beautiful tumor. 
 Are you taking this out? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I wish, but, no. 
 I can't do it. 
 Is it too risky? 
 Please. 
 I would destroy that thing. 
 No, I can't do it because it belongs to Richard's niece. 
 And she doesn't want me to. 
 We look so much alike we could be twins, which is, you know, surreal, but it's not more than I can handle. 
 But she thinks it would be like getting cut into by herself. 
 I had a dream like that once. 
 - Not good. 
 - What are we all doing here? 
 - Alex. 
 - Patient. 
 What patient? 
 - Sexy. 
 - Yeah, I know. 
 I told Owen about the baby. 
 Oh, that's why you're here. 
 I thought you were defecting. 
 I told him about the baby, and he got weird. 
 That's understandable. 
 Is it? 
 I mean, he's with Teddy, and he's happy. 
 And just now, he just seemed like he was angry with me for being pregnant. 
 But he's gotta get with the program. 
 This kid is gonna be Leo's little brother or sister. 
 So he and Teddy are gonna be aunt and uncle, I guess? 
 Does Leo call Teddy ""Mom""? 
 No, no, he calls her ""Weddy"" because he's working on his T's. 
 Oh, I get the question. 
 Uh, I'm Auntie Amelia. 
 Betty's more like big sister. 
 So Teddy's stepmom, I guess? 
 [PAGER RINGING, CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 Damn it. 
 Sabi's crashing. 
 Here. 
 [SIREN WAILING] 
 Sabi is? 
 Her patient. 
 And Richard's niece. 
 - Oh, damn. 
 - Yeah. 
 [WAILING CONTINUES] 
 You know, Owen can be pissed at me I don't care but he can't take it out on a patient. 
 Do you want any? 
 [WAILING CONTINUES] 
 Everybody's got a patient. 
 I want a patient. 
 - [ALARMS BLARING] 
 - What happened? 
 She just stopped talking She went into respiratory distress. 
 - I had to intubate. 
 - [BLARING CONTINUES] 
 The tumor is obstructing blood flow to her lungs. 
 Let's push fluids and start pressors. 
 - Where's my sub? 
 - He's in the parking lot. 
 But I didn't want him operating. 
 This is all you. 
 I'm glad you came to your senses. 
 Prep an OR! 
 Let's get her ready to move! 
 Wait. 
 I didn't say you could. 
 You're not supposed to operate. 
 I haven't even talked to the other doctor. 
 I know you say I always think I know what's best. 
 Well, in this case, I do. 
 I know Margaret Pierce. 
 And there's not a surgeon in this city with half of her skill and expertise. 
 Chris, please. 
 Don't put your daughter's life in someone else's hands. 
 - Thank you. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 I should've said it sooner. 
 All right, come on, let's move. 
 Move! 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Hey, you look like someone I used to work with. 
 Thank you for letting me do this. 
 Hello, everyone. 
 I'm Maggie Pierce. 
 I'm Chief of Cardiothoracic at Grey-Sloan Memorial. 
 Don't hold that against me. 
 Who is ready to take on the biggest biatrial myxoma - I have ever seen? 
 - This isn't gonna work if she doesn't know everyone's listening. 
 - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
 - All right! 
 That's better. 
 Okay, folks, best behavior. 
 If we impress Pierce, she just might come and run cardio for us. 
 You know that's never gonna happen, right? 
 You'd be surprised how many times it's worked. 
 Hmm. 
 Shout if you need anything. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 Scalpel. 
 I'm sorry if I raised my voice earlier. 
 Maggie really is the best there is. 
 Sabi couldn't be in better hands. 
 Last time you tried to calm my nerves in a waiting room, Mom died. 
 I was 10 years old, Chris. 
 No signal here. 
 I need to call the family. 
 WOMAN ON P. A. : Dr. Sykes Dr. Jennifer Sykes, call Recovery. 
 Dr. Sykes, call Recovery. 
 Hey, Richard. 
 What's wrong? 
 - N-Not now, Gemma, please. 
 - Oh, we go back too far back for me to leave you alone looking like this. 
 What is it? 
 You need a meeting? 
 Um Maggie's operating on my niece right now. 
 She came out here for the first time in years. 
 Her father, too. 
 For my help. 
 I thought they wanted nothing to do with Maggie. 
 My brother and sister, yes, but Sabi, she's not like them. 
 She's welcoming and forgiving and kind and I turned my back on her. 
 Family's complicated. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I know. 
 I keep saying that. 
 But I feel like it's just an excuse now. 
 You made a sincere attempt at amends. 
 If the other person doesn't want to hear it, that's not on you. 
 They aren't wrong. 
 I did think I was better. 
 Or at least knew better. 
 You know, I never understood why they were so content staying in their small, little world. 
 You know what Chris said to me when I told him I was an alcoholic? 
 ""That's what you get. "" Like ambition was to blame. 
 Like everything would've been fine if I hadn't gotten a big head and left home. 
 I'm sorry, Richard. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Richard? 
 Catherine. 
 Uh, oh, well, this is Gemma. 
 Uh, she's a friend. 
 I can see that. 
 It's so good to meet you, Catherine. 
 I've heard a-a lot about you, and, um - Well, I'll let I'll let you two be. 
 - Yeah. 
 Um I wasn't sure you'd come. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Of course I came. 
 It's family. 
 CHRIS: Vanessa's making calls. 
 Starting a prayer chain. 
 Oh, uh, Catherine, you remember Chris. 
 Of course. 
 Chris, you must be worried sick. 
 Once we go on bypass, I'll make my incision into the right atrium. 
 What's her activated clotting time? 
 ACT shows 300 seconds and rising. 
 That's good enough to start. 
 Let's go on pump. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Clamps off. 
 Clamp. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 And so how is Vanessa? 
 Is she still in that house? 
 She'll never leave that house. 
 I did some work for her. 
 I added a sunroom in the back. 
 Oh, that sounds lovely. 
 And the, uh the the hardware store? 
 - It closed last month. 
 - Oh. 
 Everyone orders online now. 
 It closed? 
 No one told me that. 
 You didn't ask. 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 So, uh, when was the last time you all came to visit Seattle? 
 Well, um, Sabi couldn't have been more than what 8? 
 Hmm. 
 W-What was that game she always wanted to play? 
 Um Papa Never Misses! 
 The little ones would line up on one side of the yard, Chris on the other. 
 And they would throw him a football as crazy as they could. 
 I mean, they would fling it, and flip it, and spin it. 
 [CHUCKLING] 
 They'd try everything to make him miss, and he never did. 
 Not once. 
 Papa Never Misses. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Sabi came close a few times, though. 
 Yeah, I remember once we had a kiddie pool set up, and Sabi would fill a little pail of water and pour it over her cousins' heads, and they would laugh. 
 But then, one time, my my nephew W-Was that Was it Eddie, Jeffrey, or? 
 - It was Eddie. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Her cousin Eddie poured a pail of water - over Sabi's head. 
 - Oh. 
 - Oh, she burst into tears. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 She came running to me. 
 She said [WHIMPERING, STAMMERING] 
 ""Uncle Richard, tell Eddie we don't play like that!"" [LAUGHTER] 
 - Oh, boy. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 - That's Sabi. 
 Adele loved that story. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You got a vending machine around here? 
 Oh, yeah, down the hall. 
 Oh, you need some cash? 
 I can afford a soda, Rich. 
 Everything I say pisses that man off. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay, look, I don't know what you think you saw, but We will talk about that later. 
 There is nothing to talk about, Catherine. 
 Gemma is an accountant here. 
 A friend from the program. 
 A while back, she needed a job, I made some calls. 
 It was before I even worked here. 
 I've known her for years. 
 She was concerned, and that's all. 
 You're talking an awful lot for someone who says there's nothing to talk about. 
 [TAB POPS] 
 I need some fresh air. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [QUIETLY] 
 Doctors made Mommy all better, Bub. 
 I'm so sorry I scared you. 
 I love you so much. 
 And when I'm all better, we're gonna go to the zoo. 
 Can we see the baby giraffes? 
 Yes, anything you want. 
 Okay? 
 But right now, Mommy's got to rest a little bit. 
 All right? 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I got so lucky with Henry. 
 He's such a good kid You know, he's so happy, even with the little I can give him, and he does not deserve less. 
 Of course not. 
 And you don't have to explain that to anyone. 
 It is your decision, even if you didn't have Henry or money problems. 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 All right, Cassidy, the doctors said the labs and imaging showed an eight-week pregnancy, so you're all clear. 
 Okay, so that's it? 
 It's just the pill? 
 Two pills, actually. 
 You'll take one medication now to block the hormones that keep the pregnancy viable, then a second pill in 24 hours to help contract the uterus. 
 You'll feel nauseated and crampy, probably emotional because hormones. 
 Okay. 
 And it will be difficult when you're passing the tissue. 
 A lot of doctors say it's like a heavy period, but it's more than that. 
 It's completely safe. 
 I just want you to be prepared. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Thank you. 
 You'll need to schedule an appointment with an OB in about a week or so to confirm that the medication worked and that there's no infection. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you so much. 
 I'm so grateful to both of you. 
 Looks like Dr. 
 Hunt is here to do some post-op work, so get some rest, Cassidy. 
 And you have my card if you need anything. 
 [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 Oh, hey. 
 Any news? 
 Still in surgery. 
 - I'll say another prayer. 
 - Mm. 
 Richard tells me you're quite gifted. 
 Pardon? 
 With numbers. 
 You work in accounting, right? 
 - Oh. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Yes. 
 - Mm. 
 You know, at the Fox Foundation, we're always looking for people we can trust - with our finances. 
 - Oh. 
 There's a lot of opportunity. 
 I'm sure it pays better than this place. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You're too kind. 
 Any friend of Richard's Give him a r√É¬©sum√É¬©. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe I will. 
 You should. 
 We have openings all over the country, though none here in Seattle, I'm afraid. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I should be getting back inside. 
 Have a good night. 
 [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING] 
 [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] 
 Okay, I've dissected most of the tumor from the right atrium. 
 Suction. 
 [ALARMS BLARING] 
 MAPs are dropping. 
 The bypass circuit is clotting off. 
 Damn it, she's clotting. 
 Why is she clotting?! 
 What is her ACT now? 
 370 seconds. 
 What?! 
 You said it was 300 and rising before we started. 
 It should be over 480 by now. 
 We could've given her more heparin. 
 She's been dosed multiple times with heparin. 
 Why didn't you tell me she had stopped rising? 
 Our cardio doctor always asks. 
 It's protocol. 
 You never asked. 
 Okay, she's heparin-resistant. 
 Her blood doesn't clot like normal. 
 Her pressure's gone. 
 Okay, everyone stop and listen to me! 
 We have three minutes before we lose this patient from lack of blood flow. 
 We need a new bypass machine and pumps, ice to keep her body cool, and start FFP. 
 Let's move! 
 Clamps! 
 [ALARMS BLARING] 
 Come on. 
 Come on. 
 Stay with me. 
 Amelia. 
 You crossed a line. 
 She needed help that you wouldn't give her. 
 You don't work here. 
 Well, from what I've heard, most of the people who do lack the skill and sensitivity that I have, so you could just say thank you. 
 Owen, did you really want to force that poor mom to bring another human being onto the planet against her will, or did you refuse her an abortion because I wanted to help her have one? 
 You don't get to come to my place of work and order me around, okay? 
 [DOOR SLAMS] 
 I didn't order you around. 
 I ordered her an OB who ordered her some pills! 
 And you're angry with me for reasons I can't quite ascertain. 
 So you said no to her because I said yes. 
 I said no to her because 'cause sometimes people change their minds, and she was traumatized by a fall. 
 A fall that she took accidentally after intentionally trying to abort the fetus. 
 You think that the trauma would change her mind? 
 Is this about me?! 
 Is this because I'm pregnant? 
 So you think that women who say that they don't want babies are gonna just wake up one day and change their minds? 
 Amelia, that's absurd. 
 I agree. 
 She was clear. 
 She knew what she wanted. 
 She was not gonna change her mind. 
 And for the record, I did not change my mind, either. 
 I I just got pregnant, and I exercised my freedom of choice to not have an abortion. 
 That's right. 
 So you didn't want to have kids, but now you're with somebody else, and you do. 
 Y-You're You're perfectly happy now that you're having a baby with another man! 
 You and I broke up twice. 
 - Once when we got divorced and then - Yeah. 
 Yeah, we got divorced. 
 You remember why we got divorced? 
 You remember the pain that you put me through when you told me that you didn't want to ever have kids? 
 That you didn't want to ever be a mother? 
 That pain, that ""truth,"" Amelia, it It ended our marriage. 
 And now you're telling me that it's not because you didn't want to have kids, you just [SIGHS] 
 You didn't want to have them with me. 
 Owen. 
 Uh, I gotta, um Amelia. 
 Amelia, wait. 
 Wait. 
 Owen. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's my turn to apologize.

 I should not have ambushed you at your place of employment. 
 I should've known that this was gonna be a bigger conversation, and I'm sorry. 
 When I told you that I didn't want kids I didn't. 
 I didn't when we started seeing each other and you had Leo. 
 I didn't when Betty showed up. 
 If I'm honest, I didn't even know for sure when I found out I was pregnant. 
 But something changed. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What we went through with Leo and Betty is a big part of that. 
 I wasn't ready before. 
 I am now.

 I like it. 
 I always liked it.

 'Cause there's a lot of us. 
 There's me, Teddy, you, Link, Leo, Allison, and - you got a name yet? 
 - Uh W-We literally have nothing. 
 And I don't know how this works. 
 I mean, there should be a book Like, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting, But You Already Sort of Have an Adopted Kid with Your Ex"" ""Who Just Had a Baby with His, uh, Soul Mate.

 I've only known Maggie a few years. 
 But in that time, I've grown to care about her more than any person I've ever known. 
 I worry about her future, - her safety, her happiness.

 How long has the circuit been down?

 I can.

 - Seven minutes.

 There's just too many clots. 
 We need some more ice! 
 We need to cool her down some more. 
 Nuce, seven minutes is too long. 
 We can get her back! 
 We can get her back! 
 Her entire circulation has clotted off. 
 There's no way she can recover from that.

 She's gone.

 What happened? 
 What was the problem, and what did you do? 
 Don't make it personal. 
 During surgery, we discovered that Sabrina has a resistance to heparin, - so her blood - W-What's that? 
 W-What's heparin? 
 Uh, it's a drug to prevent clotting. 
 Which didn't work for her. 
 So during surgery, her blood began to clot, and that clogged the bypass machine, which meant we had to change machines mid-surgery. 
 I-I don't understand. 
 So you had to stop? 
 Is she okay? 
 Answer questions directly. 
 This is not your loss. 
 This is not your pain. 
 Never make it about you. 
 Sabrina's condition was critical before we ever got to the operating room. 
 I did everything that I could, but, unfortunately, I couldn't save her.

 None of your business.

 to be known as an orgasm. 
 Uh, yeah, I may have, uh, given

 Wow, blasphemy. 
 I am Dr. Bailey. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What are you waiting for? Let's go. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I-I thought I met all the attendings. 
 I'm Mika Yasuda. 
 No need to apologize. I don't work here. 
 Dr. Bailey was chief of surgery 
 until about six months ago. 
 I left to spend time with my family. 
 That's nice. 
 It was, and then the Supreme Court went 
 and stripped women 
 of our reproductive rights. 
 Dr. Wilson has been helping me 
 with a sex-ed curriculum 
 to teach teenagers about their bodies 
 because we now live in a country 
 where the only way to guarantee 
 you don't have to carry 
 an unwanted pregnancy 
 is to not get pregnant. 
 And statistically speaking, 
 teens need some big help with that. 
 So we are making sex-education videos 
 to put up on social media. 
 We want to go viral... 
 you know, like that cat 
 that plays the piano. 
 Oh, come on, people, get with it. 
 Dr. Bailey, we're surgical interns. 
 We have progress notes 
 and nurses paging us, 
 and we're behind on discharge summaries. 
 I don't even have time 
 to look at my phone. 
 I've got like     unread texts. 
 Nurses love me. 
 You won't be bothered today. 
 And in exchange for your cooperation, 
 you get the benefit of working 
 with yet another world-class surgeon.

 Okay. 
 Addie, you really pulled out 
 all the stops on this one. 
 And I am so grateful. 
 Well, I spend every waking moment 
 obsessing about the state of 
 women's health in this country, 
 so this was an easy yes. 
 Yeah. How much fallout are you 
 experiencing in California? 
 Last week, I had five patients 
 asking for prophylactic tubal ligations 
 before they go to college, 
 because they're afraid 
 of getting pregnant 
 in hostile states. 
 -year-olds wanting to get 
 their tubes tied. 
 I mean, it's the actual apocalypse. 
 ? I didn't even want kids 
 until I was   . 
 Hi. I'm Jo Wilson. 
 We actually met during your grand rounds 
 on uterine transplants. 
 And Dr. Schmitt is a g... 
 is a good friend of mine. 
 Unless you didn't like him. 
 Then I hate him. 
 Dr. Wilson, I've heard great things. 
 Uh... 
 - Would you excuse me just a minute? 
 - Mm-hmm. Sure. 
 I cannot believe it. Shep... 
 Dr. Montgomery. 
 It's a... an... an honor

 What do you mean, 
 I don't have any interns? 
 They're off on some special assignment. 
 Well, what, did they enlist? 
 Bring them back, Owen. 
 I have a full pit, 
 one surgical resident, 
 and you, who's worse than useless to me. 
 You know what? 
 Talk to someone who cares. 
 - Oh, excuse me, Dr. Altman. 
 - What? 
 Well, as much as I respect the purpose 
 and intention of Dr. Bailey's project, 
 I could really use some more 
 hands-on experience in the pit. 
 I'll do H&Ps, run labs, suture, 
 drain abscesses. 
 I'll do anything you need. 
 Mm. You happy now? Don't answer that. 
 You're never happy. 
 I'm a very happy person. 
 He's just bitter and broken. 
 Let's go. 
 BAILEY: These are your scripts. 
 Stick to them. 
 STDs, menstrual cycle, anatomy, 
 and you're all on contraception. 
 Uh, Dr. Webber, 
 there's plenty to go around. 
 - Would you like to pick a topic? 
 - Richard? 
 Uh, when I was   , 
 I was handed a sack of flour 
 to care and treat like a baby. 
 Do you have that? 
 I'll be in my office. 
 Alright, uh, any questions, 
 comments, concerns? 
 Um, yeah. 
 This is very important and all, 
 but I am not your guy. 
 - Never had sex before? 
 - [INTERN SNORTS] 
 This is your assignment today, 
 so you are our guy. 
 I think what Dr. Kwan 
 is trying to say is, uh, 
 we're not exactly qualified for this. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay, do you understand 
 that hundreds of thousands of teenagers 
 will become pregnant this year? 
 And now a lot of those children 
 will be forced 
 to carry their babies to term, 
 or worse, give themselves 
 back-alley illegal abortions, 
 get septic, and die. 
 So if you all want to go hold 
 a retractor, go ahead. 
 The rest of us will be here 
 saving lives. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, s-so, we just talk into the camera?

 Please follow me, ma'am. 
 NICK: Hey. Yeah? 
 Uh, is it true that you, uh, 
 gave away the surgical interns? 
 Yeah, it's just for one day, though. 
 How much of the day? 
 'Cause I need them to round 
 on Maggie's patients. 
 Otherwise, I'll need to round 
 on her patients, 
 - as well as my own patients. 
 - Right. 
 What are they even doing? 
 Uh, sex videos to prevent 
 teen pregnancy. 
 Sex videos? 
 Uh, no. Uh, sex-education videos. 
 Oh, okay, well, that... that's an 
 important word in that sentence. 
 It is. 
 Okay, I guess I'll start rounds, then.

 you took an elevator down three flights,

 in your mom's office? 
 That's what that door is? 
 What's up? 
 Okay, fine, I was looking for 
 a gallery to watch surgery. 
 - Ah. 
 - Please don't tell my mom. 
 I can't do more 
 history homework. I can't. 
 Yeah, well, I never really liked 
 history either. 
 All the battles you have to memorize,

 Who thought that looked good? 
 Okay, well, I don't have to be 
 in surgery for a few hours. 
 You want to see something cool? 
 Okay, let's go. 
 SIMONE: Track your menstrual 
 cycle with pen and paper, no apps. 
 If you get an abortion, 
 hostile states might be able 
 to use your phone as evidence 
 against you in criminal court. 
 If your period is late, 
 take a pregnancy test. 
 Um, medical abortions are still, uh, 
 legal and available in many states. 
 But, um, uh... 
 But you have to know 
 that you're pregnant early 
 if you want to use it. 
 Take one birth control pill by mouth 
 every day at the same time. 
 Or you can get an IUD or an implant. 
 IUD goes into the uterus. 
 An implant goes into your arm. 
 Both are   % effective 
 at preventing pregnancy. 
 Morning-after pill. [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Uh, if the first layer 
 of contraception fails, 
 take this as soon as possible 
 to, um, prevent pregnancy. 
 Oh, look, see, that girl over

 Either way, it's late. 
 What's late? 
 Oh. 
 Okay, well, um, 
 your period can be late, 
 for all sorts of reasons. 
 But if you want, I can take you 
 for a blood test, 
 just to be sure. 
 Are you a doctor? 
 Yes, I am a doctor. 
 And you won't tell my parents? 
 No, this is between you and me.

 is you take the left grasper 
 and pass the peg to the right grasper.

 Did I do it wrong? 
 No, you did it, uh, seamlessly. 
 You sure your mom's 
 never shown you this before?

 how long it took for me to nail that.

 you wanted to be a doctor?

 Um, at first I wanted to be the Flash. 
 I thought he was underrated but cool. 
 Then I thought I was gonna 
 play professional baseball.

 And, uh, then I decided I was 
 gonna be a science teacher.

 You know, I forgot one. 
 At one point, I was gonna be 
 an astronaut.

 your... your passion for science?

 That's a cognitive puzzle. 
 Most adults can't do it that fast.

 other grandchildren. 
 But Denise is my baby. 
 She needs me with her. 
 Uh, excuse me. 
 We're looking for Denise Ward. 
 This is her mother.

 She took her husband's name. 
 I'm not an O.B. nurse. 
 And you have a tablet in your armpit. 
 Just... 
 Are you sure Denise came here? 
 Uh, maybe she went to Seattle Pres. 
 No, no, she said Seattle Grace. 
 Uh, okay, got it. 
 Just give me a minute 
 to find your daughter's chart. 
 You know, if they have a boy, 
 they're gonna name him Calvin. 
 I don't love it, 
 but I'm staying out of it. 
 I hope it's a girl, 
 'cause if they have a girl,

 BAILEY: Did we get ahold of her parents? 
 JO: Mom's on the way. 
 She also said it could 
 just be bad cramps, 
 because Diamond has 
 ""extremely traumatic periods."" 
 ""Traumatic"" or ""dramatic""? 
 [LAUGHS] It's unclear. 
 Diamond, are you on your period? 
 Did my mom tell you that? 
 She tells everyone when 
 I'm on my freaking period. 
 I get a bad grade on a math quiz, 
 she tells my teacher I'm on my period. 
 Like, we bleed. Why does it matter? 
 I'm the virgin who likes anime, 
 who passed out 
 during sex-ed class. 
 Wow! 
 That's a giant cyst on the left side. 
 Look, it's... it's displaced 
 her entire abdomen. 
 And look, whirlpool sign on the right. 
 The vasculature is twisted, 
 suggesting ovarian torsion. 
 She'll need surgery right away. 
 Well, then let's go. 
 Book an O.R. and call her parents. 
 Dr. DeLuca is still in her hysterectomy. 
 I have never done one of these 
 on my own. 
 Well, good thing we know 
 someone who has. 
 Find Dr. Montgomery. 
 She's gonna need privileges. 
 So are you. 
 SIMONE: Double up 
 to protect against STDs. 
 The pill and a condom, 
 an IUD and a condom, 
 but never use two condoms 
 at the same time. 
 - They'll break, and you...

 Ooh! could get pregnant. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Just got paged to the pit. Bye! 
 You don't want me demonstrating condoms. 
 - I mostly have sex with women. 
 - Mm. 
 Uh, and I don't want to. 
 Why did you even go to medical school 
 - if you don't want to help people? 
 - Do want to help people. 
 When they're under anesthesia 
 and can't ask me questions. 
 - Are you a Capricorn? 
 - That's not a real thing. 
 Okay, no, that is for the condoms. 
 Who wants to know where the clitoris is? 
 ‚ô™ 
 The vaginal opening 
 is right around here. 
 And then you go up, up, up, 
 and this point at the very top 
 is the clitoris. 
 Now, it's a bundle of 
 extremely sensitive nerves. 
 So, if you touch it too hard, 
 you will cause pain. 
 You want to approach gently 
 with a flat hand. 
 Gently, no poking. 
 It's not a button. 
 Yeah, and for those of you with vaginas, 
 getting to know this part 
 of your body on your own 
 is the easiest way 
 to avoid getting pregnant. 
 Have you ever tried to... 
 really hold on, 
 like you're riding on a roller coaster, 
 and you're not allowed to scream 
 until you get off the ride? 
 - [LAUGHTER] 
 - That is the pull-out method. 
 It is truly an excellent way 
 to accidentally get someone pregnant. 
 Dr. Millin? Thank you, Doctor. 
 ‚ô™ It's amazing, we made it ‚ô™ 
 - Dr. Kwan? 
 - Thank you, Doctor. 
 Now, hold it at the tip 
 of an erect penis. 
 That part's very important. 
 And then you roll it down... 
 [SNAPS] 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 You out of practice? 
 Never had to put a condom on 
 anything as small as a banana. 
 You get a condom, you get a condom, 
 you get a condom, you get a condom! 
 Everybody gets a condom! 
 Whoo! 
 Any more questions? 
 ‚ô™ Whoo ‚ô™ 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Ah, Schmitt. 
 Just the person I was looking for. 
 Oh, Dr. Montgomery, please don't make me 
 teach sex ed to high schoolers. 
 I hated high school. 
 I-I can't go back. I can't. 
 This isn't about sex ed. 
 Oh, well, in that case, hi. How are you? 
 I have a patient. 
 She's waiting on a pregnancy test. 
 I have got to run into 
 an emergent ovarian torsion. 
 Can you keep an eye out for 
 the results and deliver them? 
 Of course. 
 And, Schmitt, she's scared. 
 Oh, I can relate to a scared 
 high schooler. 
 One of our students collapsed. 
 She has an ovarian torsion. 
 I want to get her in the O.R. 
 right away. 
 May I have privileges? 
 Uh, I-I didn't catch that. 
 Could you say that again, louder? 
 I am requesting privileges, please. 
 - Do you have a r√©sum√© with you? 
 - For real? 
 Standard operating procedures. 
 Any references? 
 - Are you done? 
 - Privileges granted. 
 What about the sex ed? 
 Oh, she needs experienced hands, 
 but if you want to check 
 on the interns... 
 No, thank you. 
 Dr. Teller, extension     . 
 JOYCE: Denise! 
 Where's my grandbaby? 
 Granny, uh, it's me... 
 Simone, your granddaughter. 
 Denise isn't here. Remember? 
 That's not funny, Denise. 
 I'm not Denise, Granny. I'm Simone. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 Mom died. Remember? I'm sorry. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 ‚ô™ 
 - I want to go home. 
 - Okay. 
 Well, I'm working right now, 
 but we can call Dad. 
 - He'll be... 
 - No. Get away from me. 
 I don't want you. I want my daughter. 
 - Granny, come on. 
 - I said no. 
 Mrs. Ward, it's okay. 
 - Get away from me. 
 - Granny, come on. 
 - Somebody help! 
 - It's me. 
 Hi. Can I help? 
 It's okay, it's okay. I got this, okay? 
 Ma'am, can I help you? What do you need? 
 Should we take some deep breaths? 
 [INHALES DEEPLY, EXHALES SLOWLY] 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 Deep breaths. There we go. 
 ‚ô™ 
 How can I help you? 
 [VOICE BREAKING] Can you 
 help me find my daughter? 
 I would love to help you 
 find your daughter. 
 ‚ô™ 
 - AMELIA: Did he page you too? 
 - Yeah. 
 What's going on? 
 Why isn't Zola doing her homework? 
 Well, we got... we got sidetracked. 
 And you called us because...? 
 Well, Meredith's in surgery, 
 and I needed someone else to see this. 
 - Look at this. 
 - Is she doing neurocognitive puzzles? 
 No, she's not doing them, 
 she's k*lling them, one after the next. 
 I have never seen anything 
 like it. Watch. 
 ‚ô™ 
 - Did she just...? 
 - Yeah. 
 I couldn't even understand 
 the instructions that fast. 
 Look at her. She's so relaxed, 
 like it's nothing. 
 I mean, what do we do with this? 
 What is this? 
 ""Guinness Book of World Records""? 
 You skip high school, 
 go straight to college? 
 What am I looking at here? 
 Feel like I'm watching the U.S. Open. 
 Uh, hey, could I steal you 
 for a half-hour? 
 It's for a sex-ed thing. 
 Uh, yeah, we talked about this. 
 I'm your superior. I... 
 No, it's for a literal sex-ed thing. 
 I need help with 
 a literal sex video, Link. 
 Wow. Still very not-okay. 
 And, you know, I'd prefer 
 if you call me Dr. Lincoln. 
 Everyone calls you Link. 
 Everyone except you, moving forward. 
 Okay, can you just do it? 
 I mean, we are flying by 
 the seat of our pants up there. 
 No. No, I don't want 
 to lose my job today. 
 - It's teaching. 
 - Or harassment. 
 And I don't want to tempt fate. 
 Which one of us is being harassed? 
 I don't think it matters. 
 Find an actual couple. 
 Ah, Dr. Ndugu, could you and Dr. Pierce 
 please demonstrate sexual consent 
 for a roomful of teenagers? 
 [CHUCKLES] I... 
 No. 
 Consensual sex requires no 
 verbal persuasion or convincing. 
 If you have to beg for it 
 or force it, it is not consent, 
 and you're doing it wrong. 
 So... 
 let's learn how to do it right. 
 There are    erogenous zones 
 on the female body... 
 the ear, the neck, the armpit... 
 Wait, what, the armpits? 
 Yes. You wouldn't know that, 
 because like most men, 
 you go straight for the... 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 But the nipples on many women 
 can be as sensitive as the clitoris, 
 so going straight for them 
 without any foreplay 
 to the erogenous zones, 
 can be painful and overstimulating. 
 The other erogenous zones 
 can be the stomach, 
 the inner thighs, the feet, 
 the back of the knees... 
 Have you ever had someone lick 
 the back of your knees before? 
 Wouldn't you like to know? 
 ...the more obvious erogenous zones. 
 The external vaginal region... 
 ADDISON: Wilson, tell me what you see. 
 You are draining the cyst to get 
 access to the torsed ovary. 
 And I've created a barrier to 
 prevent spillage 
 from the cyst's contents 
 into the abdomen, 
 in case of malignancy. 
 Torsion's a rare complication of cysts, 
 and I used to caution my patients 
 from imagining the worst-case scenario, 
 but now, after the stripping 
 of Roe v. Wade, 
 everything feels like 
 the worst-case scenario. 
 Amen to that. 
 I have constant rage inside. 
 Yeah, I've thought about going 
 to one of those places 
 where you pay money to destroy things. 
 Doesn't help. 
 I also have rage. 
 I moved to O.B. for joy. 
 I wanted joy, and now I'm gonna 
 watch teenage girls die 
 from sticking coat hangers 
 up inside of themselves. 
 I mean, what if it's like 
 the '  s all over again, 
 and there are septic wards? 
 Someone should make a video 
 about how dangerous a coat hanger is. 
 - That's an excellent idea. 
 - [ALARM BEEPING] 
 There's bleeding here. I don't 
 know where it's coming from. 
 Lap pad. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Let's extend the incision. 
 That exponentially increases 
 her risk for complications. 
 She's    years old. What if she 
 wants to have a baby someday? 
 If the other ovary is torsed 
 and it doesn't re-perfuse, 
 this may be all she has. 
 So, come on, let's go. 
 - Okay. 
 - Now. 
 ‚ô™ 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR, DOOR OPENS] 
 Lucia? I'm Dr. Schmitt. 
 Dr. Montgomery is in surgery. 
 Do you have my results? 
 It's positive. You're pregnant. 
 [GASPS] 
 We did it one time. 
 Did you not think that you could 
 get pregnant the first time? 
 I-I'm not stupid. 
 I just didn't think I would 
 get pregnant the first time. 
 Do you think that you might want 
 to keep the pregnancy? 
 - No! 
 - I'm sorry. I-I have to ask. 
 I can't have a baby. 
 I'm a stupid high schooler 
 who hasn't fed her fish since Tuesday. 
 All I have to do 
 is put in a pinch of flakes, 
 and I still haven't done it. 
 A kid needs food every day... real food. 
 I would be the mother 
 who forgets to feed her baby, 
 and I would get arrested or something. 
 Oh, my God, I don't want 
 to be pregnant senior year. 
 Do you know how mean kids are? 
 I do. 
 I think my parents 
 might actually m*rder me. 
 [SOBS] Hey. 
 They don't have to know 
 if you don't want them to. 
 As long as the embryo measures 
 under    weeks, 
 you can have a medical abortion. 
 We'll give you pills so that 
 you can manage it at home. 
 They say it's like a... 
 like a really bad period. 
 Yes, please, get me the pills. 
 Can we please just get this over with? 
 I'll get the ultrasound. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] 
 She's calmed down now. She's with Adams. 
 Thank you. 
 How long? 
 Uh, two years. 
 Gotten a lot worse the last six months. 
 My mother had Alzheimer's. 
 When I was an intern, 
 she got brought in here 
 with diverticulitis. 
 She kept running out of her room 
 thinking she was late for surgery. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 My grandma keeps thinking I'm my mom. 
 You must look a lot like her. 
 Look alike in some photos. 
 She died when I... was born. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Now you have to keep 
 telling your grandmother 
 - over and over that her... 
 - Ooh, I... I can't do this. 
 I can't watch this. I, um... 
 I-I put every effort I could 
 into matching across the country 
 so I wouldn't have to watch this, 
 and that went to hell, and now I'm here. 
 I'm stuck in that house, and... 
 I love her. She's my grandmother. 
 She raised me. 
 She's why I made it this far. 
 It might be helpful if you don't 
 tell her that her daughter died. 
 I know it's not easy, 
 but living in her reality 
 is the most humane option. 
 I don't think I have it in me. 
 Nobody does. You'll find it. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Is it okay if I stay out here 
 a little longer? I just... 
 Of course. 
 I really feel your pain, Griffith. 
 My door is always open. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 
 What's going on? Is Zola okay? 
 Oh, yeah, she's okay. 
 She's in there with Amelia. 
 Okay. I thought she may have had 
 another panic attack. 
 No, no. But she did find 
 some of Kai's puzzles 
 that they use for 
 neurological evaluations. 
 The puzzles mainly focus 
 on visual-spatial skills. 
 Yeah, I'm familiar with them. 
 What... What's going on? 
 Meredith, she's aced every single one 
 at a level far higher 
 than most of the adults I see. 
 I'm aware that she's smart. 
 My question is, why is she being 
 evaluated without my consent? 
 Right, well, it... 
 Yeah, it was an accident. 
 Zola discovered the test when she and I 
 were in there practicing 
 on the simulators. 
 She's supposed to be 
 in my office doing homework. 
 Mer, based on Kai's time with her, 
 Zola is extremely gifted, 
 which could explain the panic att*cks. 
 When giftedness is undiagnosed, 
 it can contribute 
 to behavioral issues... 
 anxiety, a feeling of being untethered, 
 a feeling that you don't belong. 
 Because you don't. Her brain does 
 not function like other kids her age. 
 She needs challenges that they don't. 
 She needs to be around peers 
 who can relate to her 
 and the way she thinks. 
 I'm gonna go see my kid. 
 Penetration is not necessary 
 for mutual pleasure. 
 For starters, most women, 
 or people with vaginas, 
 can't achieve orgasm 
 through penetration. 
 - Yes? 
 - How come that's not in porn? 
 Because porn is to actual human sex 
 as the ""Fast & Furious"" 
 is to actual human driving. 
 That is to say, it bears no resemblance. 
 If you are having sex with your partner, 
 and you are trying 
 to make it look like porn, 
 your partner is experiencing 
 little to no pleasure. 
 I would disagree. 
 Well, you would disagree because 
 the girls you are with 
 are also making it look 
 and sound like porn. 
 But that is just an act. 
 A real man wants to give a woman 
 a real orgasm. 
 So you want to be a real man 
 or some candy-ass actor 
 for whom a woman has 
 to pretend to enjoy sex? 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Guess they were right. 
 This is definitely going viral. 
 Oh, not yet. Need music. 
 And dancing. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Hot dog! Boston again. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - Mrs. Ward, you're k*lling me. 
 Well, I guess you're lucky 
 that you're handsome, huh? 
 Where are you from? 
 Uh, Connecticut, 
 but my dad's from Barbados. 
 - Ah. 
 - [PAGER VIBRATING, DOOR OPENS] 
 Denise! 
 Honey, you okay? 
 Hi, Mom. 
 Did you have the baby already? 
 ‚ô™ 
 It's a girl. 
 A girl? 
 Simone. 
 ‚ô™ Let the seasons change ‚ô™ 
 - Simone. 
 - ‚ô™ Well, they will anyway ‚ô™ 
 - Can I see her? 
 - Not yet. 
 The doctors are cleaning her up. 
 Oh. 
 You want to sit with us while you wait? 
 - [PAGER VIBRATING] 
 - Dr. Adams, your pager is going off. 
 Let... Let me play a couple hands. 
 ‚ô™ It's not yours anymore ‚ô™ 
 Don't go easy on her, Mrs. Ward. 
 ‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ If the wilderness between us ‚ô™ 
 - Oh, you cleaned him up. 
 - Yeah. 
 - ‚ô™ Remains ‚ô™ 
 JO: There was quite a bit of 
 damage to Diamond's ovaries, 
 but we were able to salvage them, 
 hoping to preserve 
 her fertility as best we can. 
 - ‚ô™ We got a reason to stay ‚ô™ 
 - So she's gonna be okay? 
 She will, yes. 
 I told her she just had 
 bad menstrual cramps 
 and that it runs in the family. 
 I gave her a hot water bottle. 
 I never even took her 
 to see the gynecologist. 
 Oh, this isn't your fault. 
 No, unless someone specifically 
 educates you 
 on what to look for, 
 it's hard to know what's normal 
 and what's an indication 
 of an underlying problem. 
 I'm just so grateful she was 
 with you when this happened. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We'll find a reason to stay ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Ohh ohh ohh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We'll find a reason to stay ‚ô™ 
 Ready? 
 ‚ô™ Ohh ohh ohh ohh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ I know by the look in your eye ‚ô™ 
 First, you'll take mifepristone. 
 It's just one pill. 
 It'll stop the pregnancy from growing. 
 Then, after    hours, 
 you'll take misoprostol. 
 It's four pills. 
 Put all four pills under 
 your tongue for    minutes. 
 And then after    minutes, 
 swallow whatever is left 
 of the pills with water. 
 And then a few hours 
 after you take the misoprostol, 
 you'll experience 
 some cramping and bleeding, 
 like a very heavy period. 
 Then you'll pass the pregnancy, 
 and the pain will stop. 
 How do I know if something's wrong? 
 It's extremely rare 
 to have complications 
 with a medical abortion, 
 but if something feels off... 
 fever, no bleeding, too much bleeding... 
 then I want you to call me. 
 You'll be here? 
 Yes, I will be here 
 for the next few days. 
 So you call me, day or night. 
 ‚ô™ Ohh ohh ‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ Don't let the dust settle down ‚ô™ 
 - Can I take it now? 
 LEVI: You can take it 
 whenever you're ready. 
 ‚ô™ There's a silver line 
 on the edge of this town ‚ô™ 
 JO: We're making reels. 
 Just dance and point! 
 BAILEY: We need energy, people. 
 It's for the kids. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Preach ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Mmm, teach me, baby, teach, ah ah-ah ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ So, preach it, baby ‚ô™ 
 - What are we pointing at? 
 - Oh, the facts. 
 - We'll put them on the screen later. 
 - If you say so. 
 ‚ô™ Soul loving, do the soul loving ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Preach it, baby ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby, preach ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Mm, teach me, baby, teach, oh oh-oh ‚ô™ 
 RICHARD: But why little videos? 
 Because I can't get Tuck to look 
 up from his phone long enough 
 to have an actual conversation. 
 And we have to speak their language 
 if we want them to learn. 
 Are you sure we're not gonna 
 get sued over these? 
 If someone wants to take me to court 
 for educating people 
 about their own bodies, 
 they better be prepared for a big fight. 
 So, when do you think 
 we'll see you again? 
 How does tomorrow sound? 
 Oh, you ready to come back to work? 
 Ohh. 
 Look, I just can't sit idly by 
 while my daughter 
 doesn't have the same rights 
 as her brothers. 
 This is a humanitarian crisis. 
 I would like to reopen the clinic 
 and dedicate it to reproductive health. 
 I-I would run it    hours a week, 
 and the rest of the time, 
 I will be an attending, 
 teaching the next generation of surgeons 
 who we are depending on 
 to be in this fight for the long haul. 
 Mm. Well, Meredith's still 
 interim chief. 
 She's just waiting on you to... 
 No, I-I don't want chief. 
 I'm telling you what I want. 
 I want to teach and cut    hours a week, 
 and then go home to my family 
 without the added stress. 
 That's my best and final offer. 
 Take it or leave it. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Sold! 
 Welcome back, Dr. Bailey. 
 ‚ô™ 
 [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] 
 Hi. 
 Thank you for staying 
 with my grandmother today. 
 Ah, she's incredible. 
 Doesn't remember her address, 
 but still seems to be an ace at cards. 
 Yeah, it's always been her thing. 
 Growing up, all the kids 
 played Scrabble and Monopoly. 
 I played bid whist 
 with Grandma's book club. 
 You sure you're okay? 
 Yeah, fine. 
 You're not gonna tell everyone, right? 
 Is it a secret? 
 I don't want anyone's pity. 
 I don't want to be the broken-home girl. 
 It's bad enough the chief knows. 
 I think people are just trying to help. 
 I know you're a Shepherd. 
 What? 
 - How... 
 - Something was weird with you 
 and Dr. Montgomery this morning, 
 so I looked you up. 
 She's your Auntie Addie. 
 - You tell anyone? 
 - Not yet. 
 I'll keep your secret if you keep mine. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ My skin is pale, it hurts to breathe ‚ô™ 
 Hey. 
 Kai and I are about to head out. 
 ‚ô™ Ceiling ‚ô™ 
 You okay? 
 They used to make me do these 
 puzzles all the time as a kid. 
 They'd stand over my shoulder 
 with a stopwatch, 
 take notes on a clipboard. 
 I spent years of my childhood thinking 
 that there was something 
 horribly wrong with me. 
 My mind would race. I-I-I 
 couldn't speak in front of the class. 
 I sobbed at every social interaction. 
 I... panicked. 
 ‚ô™ You don't even notice me ‚ô™ 
 And now you're living it 
 all again with Zola. 
 No, not reliving it. 
 I completely missed it. 
 I love Zola so much. How did I miss it? 
 It's hard to see ourselves in others, 
 especially when it's a side of us 
 that we feel like we've left behind. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 And then when somebody points it out, 
 it's suddenly all that you can see. 
 Mine is downstairs in the pit 
 doing sutures right now. 
 I know that extreme intelligence 
 does not mean that there's 
 something wrong with you, 
 but my gift [CHUCKLES] certainly 
 gave me some struggles. 
 ‚ô™ While I sit in silence ‚ô™ 
 What helped? 
 A kind child psychiatrist 
 who gave me tools 
 that helped along the way. 
 Zola will get her tools. 
 ‚ô™ Hide it ‚ô™ 
 We'll make sure of it. 
 ‚ô™ So I will love you from the outside ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ When your friends are telling you ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ That I am different 
 and I won't fit in ‚ô™ 
 Have you got any plans for dinner? 
 Well, you should come on over. 
 I mean, Catherine's home. 
 You know she makes way too much food. 
 Oh, I really should keep working. 
 Addie, you're gonna run yourself ragged 
 trying to solve the world's 
 problems every waking hour. 
 You know, it's a marathon, not a sprint. 
 I mean, you know me, Richard. 
 And what they've done, 
 what they're continuing to do, 
 it just... 
 I just feel... 
 Erased? 
 ‚ô™ On the inside, with you ‚ô™ 
 Yes. 
 Erased. I feel... 
 ‚ô™ I know I don't belong here ‚ô™ 
 ...erased. 
 I do know. 
 And I also know that 
 even if you spend every day 
 fighting the good fight, 
 I mean, you have to live, 
 I mean, you have to eat. 
 So come on over. 
 Catch up with old friends, 
 get some rest. 
 And wake up and do it 
 all over again tomorrow. 
 ‚ô™ I know I don't belong here ‚ô™ 
 - Okay. 
 - ‚ô™ Belong here ‚ô™ 
 So, how long are you gonna 
 stay mad at me? 
 A day, a week? What do you think? 
 Let me know. 
 - I haven't decided yet. 
 - Okay. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I mean, I'm lost with Zola right now. 
 And it just doesn't help 
 that all the people I love 
 go behind my back 
 and break all of my rules. 
 I mean, she's a great kid. 
 - She is. 
 - And she's brilliant. 
 I mean, there's a lot 
 to figure out here. 
 But, uh, we got a big piece 
 of the puzzle. 
 I mean, it's got to feel 
 pretty good, doesn't it? 
 Yeah, it does. 
 Ah! Did I get a smile? 
 See? You can't stay mad at me 
 even when you try. 
 ‚ô™ 
 MEREDITH: When done properly 
 and consensually, 
 sex can be medicine. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Fear has had its reign ‚ô™ 
 Okay. 
 - ‚ô™ Over you and I ‚ô™ 
 - Yeah. 
 We know it reduces stress and 
 strengthens the immune system. 
 ‚ô™ It kept coming in waves ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Till we were paralyzed ‚ô™ 
 It even rejuvenates your brain activity. 
 You know what I find super sexy? 
 Me. 
 I was gonna say ""surprises,"" 
 but, yeah, you. 
 ‚ô™ The downs were different ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Is the chapter finally done ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Or is it still being written? ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Say goodbye to the long crash ‚ô™ 
 But sex without connection 
 can leave you feeling empty. 
 - So [CLEARS THROAT] 
 - I, um... 
 I learned about 
 the erogenous zones today. 
 ‚ô™ Brace yourself for the whiplash ‚ô™ 
 Did you know that there are 
 spots on your feet that, um... 
 Should I... stop? 
 It's just a foot rub, right? 
 Friendship, laughter, 
 simple human touch... 
 ‚ô™ Ohh ohh ‚ô™ 
 - Done. 
 - Aah! 
 Again! [LAUGHS] 
 You're good at this. 
 I'm good at a lot of things. 
 ...these are stress relievers, too. 
 ‚ô™ A bad impression ‚ô™ 
 Because truly, it's about connection. 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ For a new direction ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ And say goodbye to the long crash ‚ô™ 
 When you're physically close 
 to another person... 
 ‚ô™ Better days are coming fast ‚ô™ 
 Mmm. 
 It's just this once. 
 Agreed. 
 It's not happening again. 
 ‚ô™ Fade the dark age to deep black ‚ô™ 
 No feelings. 
 I don't even like you. 
 I'm not for everyone. 
 ‚ô™ It's time the highs had a comeback ‚ô™ 
 ...the nervous system responds... 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Brace yourself for the whiplash ‚ô™ 
 ...the body is flooded 
 with feel-good hormones... 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 
 [GASPS] 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ To the breakthrough ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ To the breakthrough ‚ô™ 
 You should have taken sex ed 
 much sooner. 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ We're so close ‚ô™ 
 Head upstairs. 
 ‚ô™ We're so-o-o close ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ To the breakthrough ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Oh oh-oh-oh ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Say goodbye to the long crash ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Oh oh-oh-oh ‚ô™ 
 ...and everything else just fades away. 
 ‚ô™ Brace yourself for the whiplash ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Oh oh-oh-oh ‚ô™

 MEREDITH: 
 When researchers 
 studied the way surgeons 
 make decisions in the OR, 
 they found newer surgeons 
 tend to rely on the standard 
 operating procedures 
 they learned in school. 
 I don't like this one. 
 You haven't even seen it. 
 Keep an open mind. 
 I did that in New York 
 and 
 New Hampshire. 
 Brookline STEAM has one of the best 
 science programs in the country. 
 And, you know, Harvard Medical School 
 is just right down the street. 
 I want to stay in Seattle. 
 It was so much better there. 
 You said the kids 
 at SEATAC Science were snobby. 
 It wasn't that bad. 
 ‚ô™ I'm tryna make you move ‚ô™ 
 Are you feeling worried? 
 Do you need to take some deep breaths? 
 No, I just want to go home. 
 This isn't a punishment. 
 You are an extremely gifted child. 
 You are going to do great in a school 
 where other kids are as gifted as you. 
 And we can check out the aquarium after. 
 Zola, we're in Boston. 
 You're signed up to shadow. 
 Let's just check it out 
 so you can make an informed decision. 
 To make sure I hate it. 
 If you hate it, you never 
 have to come back here again. 
 Okay? 
 Let's go. 
 ‚ô™ Make you move ‚ô™ 
 It makes sense. 
 Newer surgeons have limited 
 experience to fall back on. 
 But seasoned surgeons 
 are more intuitive. 
 ADDISON: Uh-huh. 
 They mine from years of practice 
 to make quick and effective decisions. 
 What about in your brown jacket? 
 Go look. 
 And put your dad on. 
 Instead of looking for 
 his lucky baseball card, 
 Henry could be using this time 
 to actually study for his math test. 
 Hey. [CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, good. Crisis averted. 
 Okay, babe, I'll see you tomorrow. 
 I love you. Bye. 
 Sorry about that. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'm all too familiar 
 with the ""Mom, I can't find it"" 
 emergencies. 
 Was it in the brown jacket? 
 Of course it was in the brown jacket. 
 [LAUGHS] We know where everything is. 
 It's our mom superpower. 
 I mean, you'd think they'd be more 
 impressed that we're doctors. 
 Please. Tuck couldn't care less. 
 But Cynthia is thrilled we're coming. 
 Yeah, how do you know her, 
 again, med school? 
 Oh, no, college. She was 
 my first-year roommate. 
 Grew up in Chicago. 
 I thought she was very cosmopolitan. 
 How'd she wind up 
 running a clinic in Pullman? 
 Uh, her husband got a job 
 teaching music at the university. 
 Oh. She likes it? 
 Well, Pullman, Washington, 
 is no Chicago, 
 but she loves running the clinic. 
 And she loves having a couple of doctors 
 coming to volunteer even more. 
 Patients from Idaho have 
 been flooding the place 
 ever since the state 
 restricted abortion. 
 - [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
 - Okay, should be coming up here. 
 The more experience we have, 
 the less likely we are 
 to be thrown when 
 we encounter complications. 
 We can shift gears more easily 
 when it's needed. 
 - Oh, come on! 
 - [BANGING ON VAN] 
 [SHOUTING CONTINUES] 
 Whoa. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Babies don't choose abortion! 
 You're stopping a beating heart! 
 Hey, you're terminating lives, 
 and you know it. 
 - Just keep moving. 
 - You're k*lling babies. 
 You're a baby k*ller 
 'cause abortion is m*rder! 
 And you took an oath to do no harm! 
 You took an oath! 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE, 
 INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] 
 Hey. How was the bus? 
 Fine, but I took it for a reason. 
 I know. I can't say good morning? 
 You did, right after you woke me up 
 to make lunches for Ellis and Bailey. 
 Hey, I really appreciate you 
 helping out while Meredith is out. 
 I worked three   -hour days in a row. 
 I'd just fallen asleep. 
 - C-Can we not talk about this here? 
 - [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 Oh, I have an epidural hematoma. 
 Can you take him to daycare? 
 No, I have rounds. 
 I have an emergency. 
 I would ask any trusted 
 intern to do this, 
 and I assure you, they would be 
 more than happy 
 to help the chief of neuro. 
 I will let them know that you're coming. 
 Okay, bye, baby. 
 Uh... 
 Uh, where's... So, where's daycare? 
 Okay. 
 CYNTHIA: Oh, it's so good to see you. 
 So, how long has this clinic been open? 
 years. 
 Last year, we provided 
 more than  ,    patients 
 with birth control, prenatal care, 
 abortion care, STD testing, 
 cancer screening, pizza parties. 
 Hm? 
 Come on. Look outside, guys. 
 Let me at least crack a joke. 
 Well, it seems like 
 there's plenty of demand. 
 Yeah, we added a construction 
 trailer when Roe was overturned, 
 and I moved our staff 
 offices and break room 
 so we could convert more space 
 for these exam rooms. 
 - Smart. 
 - Okay. 
 Cynthia also somehow fit 
 a full-size couch 
 in our dorm room, and a mini fridge. 
 Yeah, well, I can figure out space, 
 but without volunteers like you, 
 coming from Seattle and 
 Spokane, I'd be sunk. 
 Alright. Put us to work. 
 Okay, these are the patients 
 who are ready to be seen. 
 These are the patients 
 who have not been seen. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - It's a low-tech operation, 
 but somehow it gets the job done. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay. 
 Have fun! 
 - If that couch could talk... 
 - Hey, hey. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 KORACICK: Is this where 
 the family reunion is happening? 
 And by ""family"", I mean my #workfamily. 
 - You want a photo? Let's get one. 
 - I don't, actually. 
 Good morning, Tom. 
 I see you haven't changed. 
 Well, you might want to 
 stop by ophthalmology, 
 seventh floor, east wing, 
 - because I've toned the glutes and the abs. 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 - Wow. 
 - No, Bostonians are noticing. 
 I haven't heard that. 
 Catherine, you look radiant as ever. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - Shall we? 
 Where are you two going? 
 We got a little project. 
 You want to elaborate? 
 Oh, it's not your business. 
 Well, I run the foundation, 
 so actually it is. 
 I'll loop you in when the time is right. 
 Come on. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Should I text you to tell you I'm here? 
 Oh! Hey. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hey. What's going on? 
 Tell me everything. 
 [SIGHS] Can we go up to your office 
 so that I can have 
 my nervous breakdown in private? 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Okay, Jessica, uh, do you 
 have enough prenatal vitamins? 
 They're still free. 
 - I could use more. 
 - Okay. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Okay, come back in two weeks, yeah? 
 Um, great. 
 I made all my appointments weeks ago. 
 It's too hard to get in here otherwise. 
 Alright, take good care. 
 I loved my ""measure and 
 listen"" appointments 
 when I was pregnant with Tuck. 
 My favorite part about being an OB. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - So, what have you had so far? 
 Um, I did consults with six women 
 who wanted medication abortions. 
 - I gave pills to five. 
 - Did someone need a D&C? 
 They changed their mind. 
 - We are making progress. 
 - Mm. 
 - Progress is neither swift nor easy. 
 - [GROANS] 
 - Marie Curie.

 Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got him, 
 I got him, I got him. 
 He's in there somewhere. 
 - Dad-o. 
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm looking for him, 
 I'm looking for him. 
 Ah, here's Dad-o, here's Dad-o. 
 Aw, damn it. 
 C-Crap. 
 I mean, u-uh... uh, whatever, whatever. 
 Sorry. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 You getting out? 
 No. You? 
 Going down. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 - Wow. 
 - He's Lincoln's. 
 And Shepherd's. We know what's up. 
 I'm just dropping him off at daycare. 
 Shepherd had an emergency 
 and needed a favor. 
 Wonder what other kinds 
 of favors he does for her. 
 What's that? 
 You going to the lunch-and-learn today? 
 Dad-o. 
 Oh, my God, he just called you Dad. 
 No, no, no. 
 It's h-his Dino. 
 He... He... He can't say ""Dino"". 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 - Alright. 
 - Isn't the daycare two floors up? 
 Uh, stairs are good exercise. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [SIGHS] 
 I miss paper. 
 Same. 
 Except, at least with e-records, 
 I can read my own notes. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I've got a   -year-old with a 
 cesarean-scar ectopic pregnancy. 
 C-section scar? 
 Yes, the fetus can attach 
 to the scar on the uterine wall. 
 Her OB found it 
 on an ultrasound this morning. 
 He wouldn't remove it. They're in Idaho. 
 It's a life-threatening case, 
 so there should be an exception. 
 There's cardiac activity. 
 He didn't want to take the risk. 
 The law is confusing. 
 Nobody wants to be the first one 
 to lose their license 
 or be charged with a felony. 
 Alright. I'll see her. Which room? 
 Across the border in Moscow. 
 She called from the OB's parking lot. 
 Also, her car won't start. 
 You wanted to help. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - I'll get the keys. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 What do you mean ""panic att*cks""? 
 You know, she gets dizzy, 
 her body shakes, 
 she has trouble breathing. 
 How often is this happening? 
 Often enough. 
 I mean, her grades are slipping. 
 She can't relate to her friends. 
 Because she's scared of Alzheimer's? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I-I mean, she's very bright, 
 and she's under-stimulated 
 at school, and her mind 
 goes in    different 
 directions at one time. 
 And she's very aware that Ellis 
 died of early-onset Alzheimer's. 
 And so of course her mind goes there. 
 She's afraid that I will get it, 
 that Maggie will get it. 
 Alright. So, how you handling it all? 
 Therapy or... 
 We go to therapy once a week. 
 But it's not enough. 
 I mean, she has severe anxiety, 
 and I completely missed it. 
 She was always my cheerful child. 
 I never had to worry about her. 
 Right. So you didn't. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I just want to help her. 
 I just want to comfort her. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I am so exhausted. 
 I stay up every night, just reading 
 pages and pages and pages 
 about Alzheimer's, thinking, 
 ""Oh, if I cure Alzheimer's, 
 I can help Zola"". 
 Ridiculous. 
 Makes absolutely no sense. 
 It's ridiculous, I know, but 
 I just feel powerless and... 
 [SIGHS] 
 ... I hate that feeling. 
 What if it wasn't ridiculous? 
 What? 
 What if you try to cure Alzheimer's?

 BAILEY: [CHUCKLES] 
 Wait 'til he's a teenager 
 and you just get letters... 
 - B-R-B... 
 - Mm. 
 ... I-D-K, and the enigmatic K-K. 
 Why the two K's? 
 Tuck claims it's more respectful. 
 But, you know, what do I know? 
 I'm just his chauffeur. 
 Speaking of which, 
 I-I can take over driving. 
 I like to drive. 
 It's    minutes to Moscow. 
 Never thought I'd have 
 to drive across state lines 
 to pick up a patient. 
 - Hm. 
 - Feels like we're on the lam. 
 The medical Thelma and Louise. 
 Didn't they drive off a cliff? 
 [SNAPS FINGERS] Bonnie and Clyde. 
 Shot to death. 
 Bailey and Addison? 
 American heroes. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Is it okay if Kyle 
 picks her up after five? 
 I really appreciate it. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Yeah. You're doing plenty. 
 Oh, uh, they're here. 
 - I gotta go. 
 - Susan? 
 - Dr. Montgomery? 
 - Yes. That's me. 
 Thanks so much for the ride. 
 I didn't realize the clinic was 
 such a full-service operation. 
 Well, Dr. Bailey is also a surgeon. 
 Yeah, this is just our side hustle. 
 - Water? 
 - Ah, yes. Thank you. 
 - Seat belts. 
 - [SEAT BELT CLICKS] 
 Are you sure no one needs 
 an assist in the O.R.? 
 Or... pit? 
 The square knot is

 minutes a day 
 is a good investment in time. 
 LUCAS: Damn it. Too loose. Ahhhh. 
 Yeah, your guy's still bleeding. 
 Oh, I hope that's not his face. 
 - Or his liver. 
 - Or his heart. 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 -  - - . 
 - Oh, God forbid it's someone who needs stitches. 
 - Something good? 
 - I-I don't know yet. 
 - The pit? 
 [CHIMES] 
 Uh, yeah, something like that. 
 You sure your son 
 hasn't got us figured out? 
 - Did he seem suspicious of you? 
 - How could he not be? 
 I'm a Greek sculptor's dream, 
 and you're only human. 
 - Oh, please. 
 - No. 
 Sneaking around with the boss's mom 
 is not gonna help my performance review. 
 This is between you and me. 
 Don't let Jackson 
 get all up in your head. 
 Oh, so, what you're saying is 
 we're gonna have to k*ll him. 
 Be serious, Tom. 
 Okay, fine. I'll k*ll him myself. 
 But you... you got to deal 
 with your husband. 
 Tom, could you just please 
 tell me about my scans? 
 It's not the news we wanted. 
 So, the tumor is bigger? 
 Two millimeters. 
 Two millimeters? That's nothing. 
 It's not ""nothing"". It's growing. 
 - How you feeling? 
 - The same. 
 Mostly well. Occasional pain. 
 Two millimeters isn't 
 worth this conversation. 
 Catherine, two months ago, we did a scan 
 and we noted your tumor had grown. 
 And? 
 And you said if it grew further, 
 you'd consider more treatment. 
 - I know what I said. 
 - And it grew. 
 Two millimeters. 
 Your son thinks you're 
 still in remission. 
 - It's two millimeters! 
 - It's not remission. 
 You need more treatment. 
 And you need to talk 
 to your husband and your son 
 and let them know what's going on. 
 And you need to remember that 
 my name is on this building. 
 So I'll be the one 
 to decide what I need. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 I-I got a text about Scout Lincoln. 
 Something about an accident? Is he okay? 
 He's fine. He's just wet. 
 Oh. 
 We used his backup clothes last week, 
 - and we never got new ones. 
 - Okay... 
 We tried his parents, 
 but they're both in surgery. 
 We had your information 
 from this morning. 
 [SCOFFS] What? So I'm supposed to... 
 A few parents have found 
 clothes at the gift shop. 
 I'm sure you don't want him 
 to be uncomfortable. 
 SUSAN: Tina's bringing Emily 
 home with Colette, 
 so you can pick her up there after work. 
 I canceled the piano lesson, 
 and can you pick up fruit snacks 
 and Pirate's Booty? 
 It's our week to bring 
 the snacks to soccer. 
 Martha said she'll come 
 get me when I'm done. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Love you, too. Bye. 
 What'd I do with my keys? 
 I had them when you picked me up, right? 
 I'm sorry. I don't remember. 
 Don't be. 
 I'm usually ready for anything, 
 but ectopic pregnancy 
 wasn't on my calendar. 
 It kinda threw me. 
 Totally understandable. 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Bracelets. 
 My daughter makes them. 
 Take one. Heck... 
 - Take two, please. 
 - Aww! 
 She's made enough for everyone 
 this side of the Mississippi. 
 But it keeps her busy when I'm 
 trying to get ready for work. 
 We get it. We have kids. 
 How old's your daughter? 
 - Five. 
 - Aww. 
 She turns six next week. 
 - Ooh, sweet. 
 - Ahh. 
 She only asked for, um, one present... 
 a sister. 
 She's been calling the baby Sundae 
 'cause she loves ice cream. 
 I can still get pregnant 
 after this, right? 
 It's hard for me to know without 
 doing further imaging tests. 
 But it is possible. 
 Ohh! 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Dr. Montgomery? 
 This is bad, right? 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 Ahh! Ahh! Ah! 
 IDH inhibitors, CDK inhibitors, 
 immune checkpoint inhibitors... 
 Please. I'm not one for inhibition. 
 And historically I've 
 been grateful for that. 
 But these trials have really... 
 I've already done one of these. 
 - And it helped. 
 - It helped. 
 But it made me feel like absolute hell. 
 I said I would consider more treatment. 
 I did. It's not what I want. 
 Okay, so don't do it for you, 
 hmm? Do it for me. 
 If you think about it, 
 you really owe me one. 
 I'm getting help, if that 
 makes you feel any better. 
 - Mm? 
 - I met a medicine man in Bali. 
 I met a shaman in Peru. 
 I learned all about energy 
 medicine and frequency medicine, 
 medicines that don't make me 
 feel like I'm suffering. 
 T-That's because they don't work. 
 According to you. 
 I have an acupuncturist 
 who's done more for my pain 
 than any pill you ever prescribed. 
 And studies show that 
 Reiki will reduce pain 
 and it can improve post-op recovery. 
 - Catherine, please... 
 - Tom, Tom, Tom. 
 I know you mean well. 
 And you've been carrying my secret. 
 But this is 
 my 
 cancer. 
 Mm. 
 This is my choice. 
 [DRAWER OPENS] 
 JACKSON: Ah. Got it. 
 This group of neuroscientists 
 from Brussels... 
 they applied for a grant 
 to expand their research 
 on the connection 
 between Alzheimer's and... 
 Gut microbial composition. 
 I've read studies on it. 
 There are also some 
 that link gut integrity 
 with brain plaque production 
 and neuro-inflammation. 
 I-I saw this all in 
 the Parkinson's research. 
 Of course. 
 You already know more than the 
 group who applied for the grant. 
 It's your areas of specialty... 
 gut and brain. 
 Yeah. It's all theoretical. 
 Like you didn't just do 
 a record-breaking study 
 on Parkinson's based 
 on something that was 
 initially theoretical? 
 Come on. You should do this. 
 We could help fund it. 
 And we got facilities, equipment, tech. 
 We have this amazing partnership 
 with MIT's brain science program. 
 They could be a resource. 
 You should just fund 
 the people from Brussels. 
 They're not you! 
 Meredith Grey studying the 
 disease that k*lled her mother? 
 That's a story that would get funding, 
 and funding is what cures diseases. 
 This is exciting. 
 What's... What's going on? 
 Where'd you go? 
 Zola was miserable this morning. 
 And I could never move to Boston 
 if she didn't want to. 
 I mean, she's been through so much. 
 So much trauma. 
 She lost her birth family, 
 her birth country, 
 her father died, I almost died. 
 You know, all of that stuff is... 
 is just now coming to the surface. 
 I really need to focus on her. 
 Okay. I hear you. 
 I love you both. 
 Not exactly gonna give up 
 on this entirely, okay? 
 Not just yet. 
 When did you become so relentless? 
 [CHUCKLES] When I took this job. 
 DISPATCH: 
 - - . What's your emergency? 
 BAILEY: Yes, this is Dr. Miranda Bailey. 
 I have a   -year-old female 
 with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy 
 on a cesarean scar. 
 She's alert and oriented, 
 but hemorrhaging. 
 Pulse is weak. Abdomen 
 is rigid and distended. 
 We are in a blue Grey-Sloan 
 van on Highway    . 
 Can you send an ambulance? 
 - On its way. 
 - Thank you. 
 How's it going back there? 
 We're okay. 
 - Doing okay, Susan. 
 - [WHIMPERING] 
 What are you looking for? 
 Uterine balloon tamponade? 
 Not gonna find one in there. 
 My OB just said I was okay. 
 Well, it's difficult to predict 
 if or when an ectopic pregnancy 
 will rupture, Susan. 
 This looks like a lot of blood. 
 Is... Is this a lot of blood? 
 The pregnancy invaded the muscle layers 
 and likely tore open 
 the uterine incision, 
 which is why we have to... Ha! 
 - What is that? 
 - A Foley catheter. 
 If I insert this into 
 your vag*na and inflate it, 
 the pressure against your uterus 
 will slow the bleeding. 
 - Is that okay? 
 - Is it safe? 
 It's safer than letting 
 you keep bleeding. 
 Y-Yeah. Okay, do it. 
 Just... ohh!... make it stop. 
 Okay. I'm inserting it. 
 - Okay. 
 - Try to hold still. 
 Bailey, no sudden moves. 
 Could I have prevented this 
 if I didn't get the C-section? 
 - You didn't do anything wrong. 
 - C-sections are safe. 
 This kind of ectopic pregnancy 
 is extremely rare. 
 - You doing okay? 
 - Uh-huh. 
 Okay, I'm gonna inflate the balloon now. 
 You're gonna feel 
 a little bit of pressure. 
 Hold still. You got it. 
 Okay. 
 That should buy us a little bit of time. 
 [CRYING] 
 And how much time? 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] 
 - It's okay. 
 - [HORNS HONKING] 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 - CLERK: Do you want a bag? 
 - No, I'm good. 
 SIMONE: Oh, good luck with that. 
 I asked Schmitt for a day off. 
 He looked at me like I k*lled his dog. 
 - Uh, a bag, bag... I need a bag. 
 - Oh, hey, Skywalker! 
 Hey. W-What are you, uh, doing here? 
 Getting snacks. 
 Apparently the vending machine 
 is too lowbrow for Dr. Kwan. 
 - Yogurt-covered pretzels? 
 - I need brain food. 
 Cashews and almonds. 
 Ah, is that what powers that ego? 
 What are you doing? 
 - Uh, s-same. 
 - $  .  . 
 Wow. That is a lot of snacks. 
 I, uh... Geez. 
 I forgot my wallet in my locker. 
 I'll spot you, but I get your next appy. 
 - Hey, that's my... 
 - Ooh, ooh, ooh. 
 Wow. 
 I may be wrong, but I think 
 these are a little too small. 
 They're not for me. They're for the... 
 - Let me guess. 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 Daddy Daycare? 
 - [CHUCKLES] Oh, Schmitt. 
 - Oh, Schmitt. 
 It's okay. 
 I'll let him know that 
 you have child care issues. 
 Should I get another bag, or... 
 Yeah, and you were interested in neuro, 
 and you set that aside for Derek. 
 Oh, it was a bit more 
 complicated than that. 
 Like how hard it was to 
 choose general surgery 
 because of Ellis? 
 I wish I could make 
 one decision in my life 
 where people didn't bring Ellis into it. 
 A couple years ago, 
 I actually got to spend 
 some time with my father. 
 Realized my entire life 
 he had loomed so large. 
 He was this... mountain of a man. 
 And I spend some time with him, 
 I realize he's just some guy. 
 With wasted potential 
 and regrets and flaws. 
 You didn't want to be like him. 
 The scary part is, 
 I wasn't that different. 
 I mean, I was living 
 in cruise control, you know? 
 I wasn't fulfilling my potential. 
 Feeling that similarity 
 to him was painful. 
 But it also propelled me forward. 
 I mean, I'm happier here, 
 doing something I'm passionate about. 
 Maybe it's not an accident 
 that you're up all night 
 researching Alzheimer's. 
 Or you're feeling so 
 much pain about Zola. 
 Maybe it's all these pieces 
 of your life coming together. 
 I kinda think you're having 
 a breakthrough 
 rather than a breakdown. 
 - Relentless. 
 - No. 
 I'm just being a friend, alright? 
 I've seen you push through 
 so many things before 
 and ignore them. 
 I'm just saying that 
 this might be something 
 you don't want to push through. 
 I think you should let it help you grow. 
 Once upon a time, I did 
 want to cure Alzheimer's. 
 - Exactly. 
 - But what if it fails? 
 - Oh, it's probably gonna fail. [CHUCKLES] 
 - Right. 
 But, I mean, you could 
 definitely move the needle. 
 That means something. 
 Zola sees that her mom 
 is doing everything she can 
 to cure Alzheimer's. 
 I mean, that's pretty amazing.

 [HORNS HONKING] 
 Do you see an accident? 
 An ambulance? 
 No. Nothing. 
 How much longer will the catheter hold? 
 Not sure. 
 - Susan? 
 - [GROANS LIGHTLY] 
 Susan, stay with me, hey? 
 Okay? Talk to me. 
 Tell me, um... 
 Tell me about Emily's birthday party. 
 - It's a spa party. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 I don't know where she got the idea. 
 But her teenaged cousins 
 are coming to... 
 to paint the kids' nails. 
 And she... she wants a coffee cake. 
 Like the kind from school. 
 Ah. I... I haven't baked it yet. 
 I need to be okay. 
 I need to bake her cake. 
 I want to see her turn six. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] I want to see 
 her lose her front teeth 
 and learn how to read. 
 I... I want to teach her how to drive 
 and send her off to prom. 
 I want to drop her off at college 
 and miss her every day 'til 
 she comes home for summer. 
 I... I want to... 
 I want to... want to watch 
 her f-fall in love. 
 I w... I want to see her 
 start her first real job. 
 I want to be there for all of it. 
 Okay? 
 [SOBBING] I'm not ready to go. 
 I'm not ready to go. I'm not... 
 [GROANS] 
 Susan? 
 Susan! 
 - What? 
 - I can't feel a pulse. 
 I'm starting CPR. 
 I'm pulling over. 
 - [HORN HONKS] 
 - DISPATCH: 
 - - . What's your emergency? 
 This is Dr. Miranda Bailey calling again 
 about a patient hemorrhaging 
 from a ruptured ectopic 
 pregnancy on Highway    . 
 She's coding. We're starting CPR. 
 We need immediate help! 
 We dispatched an ambulance, but 
 there's a significant accident. 
 Road is stopped in both directions. 
 Hopefully we'll be there soon. 
 ‚ô™ What's gonna leave? ‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ What's gonna stay? ‚ô™

 ‚ô™ It's gotten hard for me 
 to recognize myself ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Think I was born in this disguise ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Staring down at the hand 
 that I've been dealt ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Trying to see through different eyes ‚ô™ 
 She's bleeding into her abdomen. 
 She's in hypovolemic shock. 
 The compressions won't do anything 
 without giving her more blood. 
 If I stop, her heart stops. 
 She has no pulse. 
 I'm not stopping. 
 Addison. 
 - She's gone. 
 - No. No. 
 Addison.

 KORACICK: That stuff 
 keep you up at night? 
 CATHERINE: Herbal tea. No caffeine. 
 Ah, I meant consistently lying 
 to your friends and family. 
 Tom, I thought we were done 
 with this conversation. 
 Well, persistence is part of my charm. 
 Y-You can't fault me for trying. 
 My friend's life is at stake. 
 [SIGHS] I spent the last 
 six months traveling abroad. 
 And everywhere I went, 
 all I thought was, 
 ""Thank God I'm not in an oncology ward"". 
 If I stay the course without chemo, 
 I'll have a few good years left. 
 I want to spend them living. 
 If the cancer gets more aggressive, 
 if there's some promising new option, 
 maybe I'll change my mind. 
 But if I'm gonna be stuck in a hospital, 
 I want it to be as a doctor, 
 not as a patient. 
 [SIGHS] At some point, 
 everyone's gonna know you lied, hmm? 
 How... How about we just 
 let Jackson in on it... 
 - No. 
 - Okay, Richard? 
 Tom, this conversation with you 
 is exhausting enough. 
 I'm not gonna have it with anyone else. 
 I am lying to protect my privacy 
 and to protect my peace. 
 I'm happy with this decision. 
 - You know what? I'm not even gonna ask. 
 - Oh. 
 Nothing to know. 
 How about if you're ready to go? 
 Can I ask that? 
 - What, you... you cutting out early? 
 - Harriet has ballet. 
 I told her she could just wait 
 for the recital, but... 
 Wait? Child, please. 
 I'm here. Let's go. 
 I don't want to miss anything. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Dr. Kwan, have you seen Adams? 
 Uh, last I saw him, 
 he was at the gift shop... 
 buying clothes for your son. 
 Don't worry. Your secret's safe. 
 Oh. You know? 
 [CHUCKLING] About you two? 
 It's pretty obvious. 
 - Is it? 
 - Yeah, when you see you together. 
 You know, it might be less obvious 
 if you gave the rest of us 
 some more neuro cases. 
 Do you have a special interest 
 in neuro, Dr. Kwan? 
 I have a special interest in gaining 
 as much experience as I can 
 before I declare an area 
 of special interest. 
 I also have steady hands. 
 And many skills in other areas 
 if your interests are... expansive. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 You think I'm playing favorites 
 with Lucas because he's... 
 Dr. Shepherd, I need a consult. 
 Is there supposed to be a patient? 
 - I got to tell you something. 
 - Okay. 
 Oh, hey, I'm glad you finally told 
 the other interns about us, by the way. 
 They think we're together. 
 Together like... dating? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 M-More like sleeping together. 
 [SCOFFS] What? H-How? 
 W-Why? W-Why? 
 - Why? 
 - I-I don't know. 
 They assume things. 
 W... Did you tell them 
 that they're wrong? 
 Lucas! You have to tell them! 
 Oh, my God! 
 Kwan was just offering me sexual favors 
 in exchange for surgeries! Wh... 
 I might throw up. 
 Oh, b-but I just... 
 No, no, no. There's no ""but"". 
 You have no idea how fast 
 rumors spread around here. 
 [WHISPERING] I don't want people 
 thinking that I am dating my nephew. 
 Just sleeping together. 
 Stop saying that! 
 Just... Ugh! 
 Fix it! 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS, LAUGHTER] 
 ‚ô™ Six feet ‚ô™ 
 How long has it been going? 
 seconds. 
 Maybe we'll get to a minute! 
 ‚ô™ It's just like the one that 
 you showed me in Oakland ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Thought you were joking, but 
 I shoulda seen it comin' to me ‚ô™ 
 - Hey. 
 - Hi. 
 - This looks so cool. 
 - It's a gyroscope. 
 The spinning wheel is creating 
 angular momentum, 
 and it's going so fast. 
 When you apply force, 
 it changes momentum 
 in multiple directions, not just linear. 
 That's what keeps it upright. 
 It's physics. 
 It certainly is. 
 - ‚ô™ And it still keeps me up at night ‚ô™ 
 - [LAUGHTER] 
 WOMAN: Sonata. 
 My mom's here. We've gotta go. 
 Bye, Zola. Hope we see you again. 
 - Bye, Matisse. Bye, Sonata.

 Just okay, huh? 
 Can we go to the aquarium now? 
 Yes. Are you hungry? 
 ‚ô™ It's barely on my mind ‚ô™ 
 [RADIO CHATTER] 
 Excuse me. They said you're her doctors. 
 Uh, we treated her today. 
 I'm looking for records, scans, 
 anything that might help 
 with the report. 
 Well, you're gonna have 
 to talk to her OB in Idaho. 
 And while you're at it, 
 you might want to ask him 
 why he refused to treat her. 
 He was following the law. 
 Just like this gentleman is doing. 
 Right. No. You're right. 
 It's the lawmakers. 
 They should actually be 
 made to come out here. 
 Yeah. 
 Have a look at the carnage 
 they've caused, 
 take a look at all the blood. 
 I mean, how are we 
 supposed to be doctors? 
 How are we supposed to treat patients? 
 We're hamstrung by laws 
 that are written by people 
 that are so far away from this. 
 I have a medical degree. 
 I have decades of experience 
 treating pregnancies. 
 What... What experience do they have? 
 Why do they get to decide? 
 No. It's wrong! 
 And it's infuriating! 
 I am infuriated, okay?! 
 Women's lives are on the line! 
 And our hands... 
 that are trained to help them... 
 our hands are tied. 
 It's... 
 [RADIO CHATTER] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [SIGHS] 
 They want us to stick 
 around a little longer. 
 In case we need to answer 
 more questions. 
 We've answered everything. Twice. 
 I know. 
 But they're about to tell 
 a husband he's lost his wife. 
 And then he's gonna need to tell 
 his child she's lost her mom. 
 I would like to be here for that. 
 [SIGHS] 
 If this is the future, it's bleak. 
 You know, I've always supported 
 the right to choose. 
 But I... just, you know, personally, 
 I... believed it wasn't 
 the choice for me. 
 But then I got pregnant. 
 A girl. 
 Then I miscarried. 
 Oh, Miranda. I'm so sorry. 
 And to add insult to injury, 
 the miscarriage was incomplete. 
 So I needed a procedure 
 to prevent infection. 
 Now, I did not choose an abortion. 
 But I've had a D&C. 
 It is the same procedure. 
 And I'm worried 
 doctors are afraid to use it. 
 I'm... I'm worried the next generation 
 won't get enough training on it. 
 I'm... I'm worried that 
 is 
 our future. 
 I want to offer it at Grey-Sloan. 
 Train anyone who wants it. I-I... 
 I want to prepare health care 
 professionals to help. 
 - That's an excellent plan. 
 - Yeah, I know. 
 And it won't be nearly enough. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [INDISTINCT PAGE OVER P.A.] 
 You take care of business? 
 No. I, um... 
 Lucas. It's your mess. Clean it up. 
 W... 
 My 
 mess? 
 D-Do you know why all the 
 interns think we're a couple? 
 Y-Y-You follow me into on-call rooms. 
 You hover over me 
 with apartment listings. 
 You got me on Daddy Daycare with Scout. 
 I asked you for help with one thing... 
 don't blow my cover at work. 
 And you've refused to do it. 
 So... 
 that makes it okay to tell people 
 that we're sleeping together? 
 [SCOFFS] I didn't tell anybody anything. 
 It is not my job to correct 
 people's misconceptions. 
 Yes, it is. You are an intern. 
 I am an attending. 
 There are rules about 
 these things for a reason. 
 [CHUCKLES] We're not actually together! 
 They don't know that. 
 You know, all my life, 
 everyone's always assumed 
 I only get anywhere because 
 of my family connections. 
 And all my life, 
 I've been my family's 
 biggest disappointment. 
 [CHUCKLING] I hav... I haven't lived up 
 to anybody's expectations as a Shepherd. 
 So I thought I'd see what 
 happens when I'm not one. 
 But now, thanks to your 
 lack of discretion, 
 everyone believes we're connected, 
 just in a-a different way... 
 a way that is admittedly disturbing, 
 but for this particular purpose, 
 better. 
 You have three days. 
 And then if you haven't 
 told them, I will. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 So, when does the clinic open? 
 A couple of days. 
 I'm already thinking of how to expand. 
 I want to do more, too. 
 I, uh... 
 I have to do more. 
 You will. From L.A. 
 No. No. 
 I want to... I want to go 
 to places where people need me. 
 Places like Pullman, you know? 
 I mean, I can't just sit. 
 I have a unique set of skills. 
 I know I can make a difference. 
 I... 
 Guess I just need to look at a map. 
 Southern Illinois. 
 It's right near Missouri, Arkansas, 
 Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi... 
 All states that have abortion bans. 
 They're expecting up to   ,    women 
 to cross state lines for care. 
 Yeah? How do you know that? 
 'Cause I thought about doing it, too. 
 But I got the baby girl 
 who recently lost her father. 
 So, she needs me at home. 
 But you, though, you... you go. 
 You go and give more 
 women access to care. 
 I just... 
 [VOICE BREAKING] Susan. It's just... 
 Wh... N... Okay. Stop. 
 You know you did everything 
 you could for her 
 under the circumstances. 
 No, you, y... 
 You needed the right tools, 
 the right supplies. 
 You needed an ultrasound. 
 You needed... 
 What? 
 The PRT. 
 Huh? 
 No. Okay. So, my husband... 
 he... he convinced the fire department 
 that he needed this O.R. 
 on wheels, but it... 
 Okay, the city sidelined it. 
 So we helped fund it, and now it... 
 it just sits in the motor 
 pool collecting dust. 
 Oh, I can think of 
 a much better use for it. 
 You said you liked driving. 
 Come on. 
 MEREDITH: 
 With enough practice, 
 surgeons learn how and when 
 to pivot from standard 
 operating procedures. 
 Well, do you like it, the lobster roll? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Did you know lobsters 
 can be yellow or blue? 
 It just depends 
 on their pigment protein. 
 Mm. 
 Did you learn that at the aquarium? 
 - Brookline STEAM has a marine science lab. 
 - Right. 
 Experience gives us more context to know 
 when we need a different approach. 
 It gives us more options 
 to help our patients. 
 I saw you laughing. 
 I saw you making friends. 
 Why don't you like it there? 
 What if we move and I 
 still have panic att*cks? 
 Or I fail school? 
 You will not fail. 
 And we are going to 
 continue the therapy. 
 We'll have left Seattle for nothing. 
 And you'll have given up your job. 
 Zola, let me worry about that. 
 That's my job. 
 You run a hospital. 
 People depend on you. 
 What if I told you Uncle 
 Jackson offered me a job 
 here in Boston, 
 working on a cure for Alzheimer's? 
 ‚ô™ We're golden ‚ô™ 
 What if... 
 What if I decide I don't 
 want to be a doctor? 
 That's completely fine. 
 Really? You wouldn't be disappointed? 
 Not at all. 
 You are so intelligent and so creative. 
 You are going to make your mark 
 no matter what you do. 
 You think so? 
 I know so. 
 You have always been and 
 will always be extraordinary. 
 ‚ô™ A new day has just begun ‚ô™ 
 So, is it Brookline STEAM? 
 Mom... 
 I love it here. 
 I want to sign up for robotics team. 
 They do this competition at MIT, 
 and last year they won first place. 
 And I want to be in the orchestra. 
 Can I please take cello 
 lessons when we move? 
 You can. 
 You can take cello lessons when we move. 
 One-size-fits-all solutions 
 don't always work. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 Every patient is different. 
 Just like every person is different. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ And we're only ‚ô™ 
 We each have various factors to consider 
 when facing life's big decisions. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ And we're only,

 Half the hospital lobbied me

 The other half is... 
 in this room. 
 Yasuda, you want to present? 
 Jermaine Talbott, . 
 Tear to the left ACL 
 due to football injury. 
 History of multiple injuries, 
 including MCL repair 
 and meniscal cadaver transplant. 
 Today, he will receive 
 a bridge-enhanced anterior 
 cruciate ligament repair, 
 also known as the BEAR. 
 And why is this his best option? 
 It uses a collagen graft 
 soaked in the patient's blood, 
 instead of donor tissue, 
 which allows the body to heal itself 
 and yields better results 
 than traditional ACL repairs. 
 Excellent. You're scrubbing in. 
 Okay, yeah, but how else is 
 the BEAR important to my career? 
 It's less invasive. 
 Because it heals faster. 
 True, but not the answer 
 he's looking for. 
 It will allow him to ambulate 
 and return to play sooner. 
 - Also yes, but no. 
 - Come on, guys. I know someone's got this. 
 The Belser Bears. 
 Played as a true freshman. 
 Led the team in sacks 
 and tackles all four years. 
 Congratulations, Kwan. 
 You're scrubbing in, too. 
 The three of you will 
 report to Dr. Schmitt, 
 who I believe is, conveniently, 
 right outside. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 It's every person for themselves now. 
 I am 
 not 
 losing another surgery. 
 We don't have to compete 
 over everything. 
 First person to do an actual procedure 
 gets the bedroom 
 to the left of the stairs. 
 What? I already drew that room. 
 - And I'm appealing the draw. 
 - What? 
 Help! Please! 
 - I'm on it! 
 - Mine! Paws off! 
 Hi, I'm Dr. Adams. Can you 
 tell us what happened? 
 I failed, doc. I couldn't do it. 
 You couldn't do what? 
 - The Pho-Nomenal Challenge. 
 - What is that? 
 The Pho-Nomenal Challenge 
 is three pounds of meat, 
 three pounds of noodles, 
 three liters of broth. 
 If you finish in an hour 
 and a half, you win $. 
 Did you just come from there? 
 No, I tried it five days ago, 
 and I have not been able 
 to take a crap since. 
 Please help me. 
 [GROANING] 
 - [INTERNS SIGH] 
 - Oh, God. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [GROANING] 
 LEVI: What do you got? 
 A -year-old male,  days 
 without a bowel movement 
 after participating 
 in an eating contest. 
 - Eating challenge. 
 - Severe abdominal pain, 
 bloating, difficulty sitting. 
 Hey, I'm Dr. Schmitt. 
 Have you tried increasing 
 your water intake, 
 eating adequate sources of fiber? 
 Exercise helps, reducing stress. 
 How am I supposed to reduce stress 
 when my entire body is full of pho? 
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
 I'm just... I'm very uncomfortable. 
 Excuse me. Um... 
 Can I borrow one of you? 
 - Me! 
 - Is it surgical? 
 [SIGHS] Go, Millin. 
 [GROANING CONTINUES] 
 Get a KUB and then 
 do a digital rectal exam. 
 Wait, I'm sorry. Digital? 
 Yeah, a finger. It helps us... 
 Okay, d... Never mind. 
 After ruling everything out, 
 you can try a stool softener 
 or an enema. 
 If none of that works, then we 
 can consider doing a procedure. 
 Ow! God! 
 - Still want that room? 
 - [GROANING INTENSIFIES] 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - Oh! God! 
 Lupe. Lupe, I'm on the phone, 
 amor, okay? 
 LUPE: Okay. 
 Uh, Sierra Deleon? 
 She can cover? 
 Great. Thank you. 
 [SIGHING] Okay, sorry. 
 I needed to make sure 
 my shift was covered. 
 Um, I'm pregnant with my third, 
 and I'm spotting. 
 - [CLANKING] 
 - Uh, here, sweetie. Come here. 
 Yeah. It's a plane. You can play here. 
 Okay, so how long 
 have you been spotting? 
 A few days. 
 At first, I didn't think too much of it, 
 but now I'm starting 
 to get a bit stressed. 
 - Oh! 
 - Lupe. 
 - [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] 
 - Okay. 
 Sorry about that. 
 [WHISPERS] Here, go sit down. 
 Go sit down. 
 Go sit. 
 Have you experienced 
 any clotting or noticed 
 an increase in the amount of blood? 
 Maybe. 
 I'm not really sure. 
 Lupe's dad drives cross-country rigs, 
 which means I'm lucky 
 if I get out the front door 
 with deodorant on. 
 Alright, I'm going to page OB. 
 We're gonna get you an ultrasound 
 to see if we can find 
 the cause of the bleeding. 
 Okay. 
 Alright, I'll see you in a bit. 
 Eeh! 
 [CELLPHONE CAMERA CLICKS] 
 - [BOTH LAUGH] 
 - Thanks. 
 Oh, now, I'm texting this to my husband. 
 He's gonna be jealous. 
 He's a t*nk fan? 
 Ah, saw you play at Royer High 
 before you were even the t*nk. 
 He predicted you were gonna be a star. 
 - Oh, okay. 
 - So I guess he's gonna be jealous 
 - and smug. 
 - Mm. 
 I was on a nighttime ER rotation 
 in the Caribbean 
 when you had that pick six 
 to win the Rose Bowl. 
 First time I tore my meniscus. 
 But we won the championship, 
 so... worth it. [CHUCKLES] 
 Storm took out the hospital Wi-Fi, 
 and I had the only hot spot. 
 Everyone... patients, doctors... 
 they all had opinions 
 on how to treat you. 
 - Oh. 
 - One of their own. 
 And now you're my patient. 
 Mm, that's an interesting angle. 
 Do you have a few minutes? 
 Could I ask you some questions? 
 Uh... 
 - Bring it on. 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 How about we step outside? 
 Eh... hold on. 
 Oh, daycare. 
 Oh. 
 I'd better see what that is. 
 Um, thank you for the photo, t*nk. 
 - No problem. 
 - [GIGGLING] 
 Bye. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 WOMAN: [OVER P.A.] 
 Dr. Azzi to Oncology. 
 Dr. Yasmin Azzi to Oncology. 
 This one? 
 You know, I had a couple 
 ACL repairs in college. 
 - Oh, yeah? 
 - Yeah. 
 Busted my knee ice skating. 
 - Used to be pretty competitive. 
 - Used to? 
 Your recovery didn't go well 
 or something? 
 - No, no, it went great. 
 - But you couldn't skate? 
 Oh, I didn't have time. 
 I got into med school. 
 Then it's on and popping. 
 Ayyy! I feel that. 
 I know you do, now. [LAUGHS] 
 OWEN: Hey, the kids okay? 
 I just got paged. 
 Yeah, me, too. 
 They probably threw blocks 
 at each other again 
 and file some sort of 
 injury report or something. 
 Huh. Hey, there is another plus 
 about being chief. 
 They usually bring 
 that paperwork to you. 
 Okay. 
 And you get a part-time 
 administrative assistant, 
 which is essential for 
 such an important job. 
 Richard told you that if I took the job, 
 that you'd be chief of trauma 
 again, didn't he? 
 No. 
 Oh, my God. 
 He briefly floated it. 
 Once again, it's all about you. 
 No, it's about us. 
 Yeah, when it's convenient for 
 you. 
 [CHILDREN LAUGHING] 
 Were all the parents paged? 
 Just the parents involved in the bite. 
 Your kid bit my kid. 
 - OWEN: Which? 
 - Allison. Bit Pru. 
 That seems like a one-parent job. 
 Let's make this one about you. 
 [CHILDREN CHATTERING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 We are so sorry. 
 Okay, Sierra, you're 
 about  weeks along. 
 - Hit the nail on the head. 
 - 
 [ULTRASOUND THUMPING] 
 There is a strong fetal heart beat, 
 and your cervix was closed on exam, 
 so everything looks good. 
 Your pregnancy is right on track. 
 You just need to rest and 
 avoid strenuous activity. 
 Her BMP came back. She's dehydrated. 
 So just make sure she gets some 
 fluids before you discharge. 
 Yeah, absolutely. 
 Okay, so we'll get you that IV, 
 and you'll be out of here in no time. 
 Oh. Great. 
 - [CELLPHONE RINGS] 
 - LUPE: Mommy, the phone. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey. What? She can't come in? 
 But she told me she was 
 gonna come in at :. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - No. I'll... I'll call her. 
 I'll call her. 
 Is everything all right? 
 Not really. 
 Yes. 
 Everything's okay. 
 LUPE: Thank you. 
 Well, I'll get you those IV fluids, 
 - and, um, you just sit tight. 
 - Okay. 
 WOMAN: [OVER P.A.] 
 Dr. Kurtz to Oncology. 
 Dr. Fritz to oncology. 
 I didn't know colleges 
 had ice skating teams. 
 Of course you didn't. 
 Because we were hitting 
 the ice at : a.m., 
 and the football team was still 
 getting their beauty sleep. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I had to stay focused so I could go pro. 
 But now I gotta kick it up a notch. 
 For the team? 
 For my family. 
 Playing ball is what will let me 
 bring them over from Port-au-Prince. 
 - Haiti? 
 - My real hometown. 
 Yeah. 
 A scout saw me play when 
 I was in the sixth grade. 
 He asked my uncle, would he 
 let me train in Seattle? 
 - Guess what he told the guy? 
 - Hm? 
 - [HAITIAN ACCENT] ""Why the hell not?"" 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 So I moved by myself. 
 I was . 
 I get to go home and see my mom 
 and my little brothers every Christmas, 
 but that's about it. [SIGHS] 
 This is my chance to finally 
 get everyone back together. 
 So I gotta get back on that field ASAP. 
 You want to succeed 
 so it means something. 
 - Sit up for me. 
 - [GRUNTS] 
 And deep breath. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 [EXHALES SLOWLY] 
 What if it doesn't work? 
 What if he can't repair it and 
 I'm stuck bagging groceries? 
 What if I can't play ball again? 
 But what if you 
 can? 
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.A.] 
 LUCAS: That is a lot of fecal matter. 
 It's really good pho. 
 It's a hole-in-the-wall in the CID. 
 You should try it. 
 Well, since you like it so much, 
 why don't you go in and give the enema? 
 Are you offering the bedroom? 
 If you throw in two weeks' groceries. 
 No deal. I know how much you eat. 
 Not as much as this guy. 
 [JARED GROANS] 
 Oh, you know what? Screw it. Gimme that. 
 [GROANING CONTINUES] 
 - Okay, bye. 
 - Mwah. Mwah. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 - Again, I am so, so sorry. 
 - Oh, please. 
 I spoke to her. 
 It was a one-time thing. 
 Allison had something to say, 
 and she couldn't get the words out. 
 Kids bite. It happens. 
 Thanks. 
 So, have you thought more about chief? 
 Well, it's a great title and a pay bump, 
 but is that really enough to... 
 - No. 
 - No? 
 No, it's not a pay bump. 
 It's more like a nudge, a small tap. 
 [CHUCKLES] It certainly 
 isn't enough to justify 
 the relentless paperwork 
 and protocols and meetings 
 and complaints. 
 So... many... complaints. 
 That's why Webber 
 doesn't have any takers. 
 But 
 you 
 are in a very interesting 
 negotiating position, Altman, 
 'cause they need you. 
 And if I were you, I'd ask for the moon. 
 And the planets. 
 And Pluto. 
 What exactly do you think 
 that all looks like? 
 - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 - Well, if it were me... 
 A full-time administrative assistant 
 who will be the point person 
 for any staff complaints. 
 And this person will also attend 
 budget meetings in my place 
 if I am unavailable and 
 take notes for my review. 
 I will need an additional 
 three weeks off 
 and double the pay increase 
 that you're currently offering. 
 And a... a stipend for research. 
 Oh. Well, this is a lot to consider. 
 These are my terms... Sir. 
 Um, I-I'm gonna need some time 
 to think this over. 
 I'm sure you understand. 
 Of course. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [MAGGIE SIGHS] 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 I thought you were clipping an aneurysm. 
 Yeah, I finished. 
 What are you working on? 
 My case report for 
 my partial heart transplant. 
 - The one on the baby? 
 - Arlo Fischer. 
 Why would I write ""socks""? 
 I have no idea. But you know who might? 
 I'm not breaking the ceasefire. 
 And I need to get this done 
 in less than three weeks. 
 You're worried another cardio 
 surgeon might beat you to it? 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 I need a win. 
 I need a victory, because I feel 
 like I'm failing at my marriage, 
 and I do not fail. 
 I hate failing. 
 Hiding from the hard parts 
 won't make it less hard. 
 It'll just make it last longer. 
 Trust me. 
 [NADINE LAUGHING THROUGH CELLPHONE] 
 It's not a durag, Mommy, 
 it's for surgery. 
 I wore it for the last two, 
 you remember? 
 Nadine: 
 You look so adorable. 
 Now, let me meet everyone in that room. 
 This is Dr. Kwan. 
 Hi. 
 And this is Dr. Griffith. 
 Very nice to meet you. 
 Where's Dr. Lincoln? 
 He's already in the OR. 
 We're about to take Jermaine there now. 
 Both of you look at me. 
 My son has broken records 
 with his talent. 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 - 
 And noses. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 You know where he got that strength? 
 - His mama. 
 - 
 Take care of my baby. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - 
 I love you. 
 Eyes forward. 
 You hear me? 
 Eyes forward. 
 Eyes forward. 
 Na pale pita. 
 Na pale pita, ch√©ri. Je t'aime. 
 [BLOWS KISS] 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 - I'm ready. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 [WHEEL LOCKS CLANK] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Hey. I just wanted to 
 wish you good luck. 
 Not that you need it. 
 I'll take it. 
 After everything 
 Jermaine's sacrificed to play, 
 he doesn't deserve 
 to be riding the bench. 
 [SIGHS] I just gotta stay sharp. 
 It's been a while since I've 
 been in the pressure cooker, 
 - you know? 
 - Well... 
 you've never folded before. 
 You're not gonna start now. 
 I know it. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Oh. Thank you. 
 So, uh, I have considered your offer. 
 - Ready to shake on it? 
 - You know, 
 Grey-Sloan is a place where... 
 where legacies are built, 
 history is written. 
 Working here, for me, I mean, 
 evokes a feeling of... duty. 
 It's an honor to serve. 
 And often, service requires sacrifice. 
 It's a little weird to put it that way, 
 especially to someone 
 who actually served, but... 
 Uh, I'm... I'm not done yet. 
 - Oh. 
 - Thank you. 
 When I see these doctors, 
 these patients, 
 it brings me joy. 
 It makes me happy, 
 um, fulfilled. 
 [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Oh. 
 And thinking about all of this, 
 well, Altman, I've decided 
 to take the job myself. 
 [CHUCKLES] I-I love being here. 
 I even love the building itself. 
 And, um, I'm... I'm happy 
 with the money that's 
 already on the table. 
 It's not about that for me. 
 So, um... 
 thank you for your time, Dr. Altman. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 - Fine. 
 - We can lose the stipend. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Oh. Okay. 
 We will... lose the... stipend. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING, AIR HISSING] 
 Excuse me. 
 - [SOFTLY] Excuse me. 
 - Hey. 
 Hey. What'd I miss? 
 They sutured the ACL and 
 are making the tunnels. 
 They're about to prepare 
 the implant for placement. 
 He wasn't asking me, was he? 
 - Very much not. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 Man, I hope this goes well. 
 The t*nk has suffered enough setbacks. 
 Are, uh, things better at home? 
 You know, all due... all due respect, 
 the last time we talked, 
 you gave me some advice 
 that kinda blew up in my face. 
 Maggie's been staying with Amelia. 
 Wh... Oh. Um... 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's... It's my fault. 
 I should have thought twice 
 before I took advice from you. 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 I mean, how are things with Teddy? 
 - Fair point. [SIGHS] 
 - Yeah. 
 Link: The tunnels are made. 
 He's ready for the scaffold. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 As amazing as I am, the t*nk 
 weighs close to  pounds, 
 and he can run  yards 
 in less than  seconds, 
 which means he can take 
 down a quarterback 
 with roughly , pounds of force. 
 Never mind what that's 
 doing to his brain. 
 That's a whole other conversation. 
 But it takes a toll on the knees. 
 SIMONE: How long can he sustain that? 
 Oh, on average, these defensive 
 players get about six years. 
 So it's only one year longer 
 than residency and he's done? 
 Let's hope he's better than average. 
 WOMAN: [OVER P.A.] 
 Third floor nurses' station. 
 O.T. Morell to the third floor 
 nurses' station. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Sorry. 
 Lupe threw my things on the floor 
 and I-I haven't picked them up yet. 
 Well, your IV is almost done. 
 Are you experiencing 
 any pain in your abdomen? 
 Sierra? 
 I can't help but notice you seem... 
 I just have a lot on my mind. 
 Sorry, I-I know you're busy. 
 Hey, don't apologize. 
 I know what it feels like 
 to be overwhelmed, 
 and I only have myself to take care of. 
 If there's something on your mind, 
 you can talk to me about it if you want. 
 The condom broke. 
 My husband and I use condoms 
 because I hate the way 
 birth control pills make me feel. 
 And it broke. 
 I wasn't trying to get pregnant. 
 Especially after my other two. 
 And, don't get me wrong, 
 I love the hell out of them. 
 I do. 
 But I'm scared it's gonna come back. 
 What's going to come back, Sierra? 
 After I gave birth to my two kids, 
 I just felt this huge wave 
 rushing towards me. 
 I would look at them, 
 and I know I love them, 
 but I was so exhausted and so defeated. 
 Depressed? 
 It was really dark. 
 I 
 was really dark. 
 Both times. 
 Both babies. 
 And the doctor called it 
 postpartum depression, 
 and he prescribed me a few medications, 
 talk therapy, but nothing worked. 
 And it lasted for months and months. 
 So when I saw that 
 I was spotting, I felt... 
 ... like I could breathe. 
 Sierra, did you... do anything 
 to try and terminate this pregnancy? 
 - No. 
 - Okay. 
 But when I thought 
 I was having a miscarriage, 
 I wasn't so terrified about 
 having to go through that again. 
 I wasn't so terrified that I 
 wouldn't be here for my babies. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 How much is an abortion? 
 Our reproductive clinic 
 provides counseling 
 and abortion services 
 on a sliding scale. 
 Would you like me to call 
 someone from down there? 
 Okay. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 That's the smallest incision I've seen 
 for a procedure so complex. 
 When I was training, they used 
 to flay open the entire joint 
 and staple it back together 
 Frankenstein-style. 
 - Mm. 
 - These days... 
 art. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Alright, okay. Well done, everybody. 
 Now let's bandage up the t*nk's knee 
 and roll him back to recovery 
 and let him rest. 
 No gawkers in the hallways 
 waiting around awkwardly for autographs. 
 And absolutely no selfies. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [SIGHS] 
 What are you doing? 
 Can't rush the rectum. 
 Wh... Uh, you're a surgeon. 
 We 
 are surgeons. 
 Yeah, and general surgery's 
 all about poop in the pipes, Skywalker. 
 [SIGHS] Curtains or shades? 
 My room gets a lot of light. 
 Eh, it's not your room 
 until you have success. 
 [TOILET FLUSHES] 
 [TOILET FLUSHES AGAIN] 
 - Yes! 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
 Jared, how are you feeling? 
 I feel like I just lost  pounds. 
 Pho-tastic! 
 It's another dish on the menu. 
 I want to say thank you 
 so much for your help. 
 Now I can go back. 
 Uh, um, I'm sorry? 
 To the restaurant. 
 I need to win that $. 
 Uh, sir, I really think 
 - you should let your digestive system... 
 - Am I free to go? 
 Yeah, you are free to go. 
 Uh, yeah, you just have to sign 
 some forms at the... desk. 
 Good luck! 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 [SINGSONG VOICE] Curtains it is. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Oh, wait. Stop scrolling. 
 His mom's phone number. 
 You think Dr. Lincoln 
 will let me call Nadine, 
 let her know Jermaine's out of surgery? 
 Nadine? What, are we on 
 a first-name basis with his mom? 
 Yeah, it's called 
 listening to your patient. 
 You know, compassion, 
 bedside manner, that kind of thing. 
 Okay, so you're saying 
 I don't have any of that? 
 Oh, you said it, not me. 
 [ALARM BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 Sats dropped to the s. 
 BLUE: Heart rate in the s. 
 So in terms of physical therapy... 
 Dr. Lincoln! 
 What's going on? 
 His vitals just started plummeting. 
 BP is now below /. 
 - Damn it. 
 - He was fine two minutes ago. 
 Alright, start him on pressors. 
 We need to re-intubate him. Now! 
 - Get Ndugu and get me an intubation tray. 
 - Yeah. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 - I don't see anything. 
 - His D-dimer's elevated, 
 his sats are failing, 
 he has right heart strain. 
 - There's a clot. 
 - Then where is it? 
 - Dr. Lincoln. 
 - I'm sorry, I'm just... 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Kwan, get him away from there. 
 WINSTON: Found it. 
 Large saddle PE at the bifurcation 
 of his pulmonary artery. 
 He needs an emergent embolectomy. 
 Alright, he needs a heparin 
 infusion immediately. 
 Alright, let's get to 
 the IR suite right now. 
 Let's move. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Half your assistant's salary 
 is gonna come off your side. 
 Now, I can't double your pay, 
 but I am ready to offer you 
 % above your initial offer. 
 Which is insulting. 
 % over, and you pay for the assistant. 
 You know, when I look at these halls... 
 Oh, please. 
 Tell me about how you 
 served 
 again. 
 Dr. Webber. Dr. Altman. 
 Uh, Shepherd? 
 I hope I'm not too late. 
 I would like to be considered 
 for the position. 
 Chief of surgery. 
 You have got to be kidding me. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 JO: At  weeks, we can do 
 an in-office procedure 
 to terminate the pregnancy. 
 Do you use a knife? 
 No. We use suction. No blades. 
 Will you put me to sleep? 
 Because I have to pick up Manny, 
 and I have to cook them dinner. 
 No, you'll be awake. 
 We can even have a volunteer take Lupe 
 for ice cream during the procedure. 
 Will it hurt? 
 You'll feel discomfort at times, 
 but we use an anesthetic 
 to numb the area. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 I love my kids. 
 I want to stay alive for them. 
 I want to be okay for them. 
 I can't do this again. 
 Okay. 
 Do you want to assist? 
 I'll see you in a bit. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 SIMONE: He's young, 
 the surgery went perfectly. 
 I don't understand how a clot 
 this size formed this quickly. 
 - It shouldn't. 
 - But it can. 
 You're saying I should have 
 seen this coming? 
 I'm saying there's nothing 
 you could have done 
 to prevent this from happening. 
 - [ALARM SOUNDING] 
 - Is that a V-Fib? 
 Get me a crash cart. 
 I'm pulling the wire. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Paddles.

 Come on, t*nk. Come on. 
 - Clear!

 Come on. 
 Eyes forward, Jermaine. 
 Eyes forward. 
 Sierra: Yes, I love you, too. 
 If you have to leave, it's okay. 
 I'll be fine. 
 He wants to stay on. 
 Is it okay if I'm on the phone? 
 Of course. Yes. 
 Okay, are you ready? 
 Okay. 
 I'm going to use my hands 
 to do a bimanual exam 
 to determine the shape 
 and location of your cervix. 
 Okay. I wish you were here, too. 
 Now we're going to insert the speculum, 
 just like a routine pap smear. 
 Okay. 
 And we will hold it still 
 with this instrument. 
 Okay. 
 Alright. 
 Now, Sierra, you may feel 
 some discomfort 
 as we administer two sh*ts 
 to numb the area. 
 Okay, ready? 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 You're doing great. 
 - [GROANS SOFTLY] 
 - Okay. 
 Millin, we'll wait a few minutes 
 for the paracervical block 
 to take effect before 
 we dilate the cervix. 
 How are you doing, Sierra? 
 - I'm okay. 
 - Okay. 
 Yes, I'm still here. 
 No, no, no. I'm fine. 
 Okay, let's follow along via ultrasound. 
 It's just an ultrasound. 
 It doesn't hurt. 
 Gel's just cold. 
 We'll measure the length of her uterus

 Okay, Sierra, you ready? 
 Okay, Dr. Millin, what do you see? 
 The uterus is  centimeters. 
 Okay, great. 
 We're going to dilate the cervix. 
 Here we go. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 JO: Okay. 
 Doing great, Sierra. 
 Okay, last one. 
 Okay. 
 Now, Sierra, I'm going 
 to use this catheter 
 along the walls of your uterus. 
 Okay, are you ready? 
 - Yes. 
 - Okay, here we go. 
 Doing great. 
 And, okay, removing the catheter. 
 Dr. Millin will use ultrasound 
 to verify completion. 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 Uterus is clear. 
 JO: Okay. 
 Removing the forceps. 
 And removing the speculum. 
 That's it? 
 And that's it.

 WOMAN: [OVER P.A.] 
 Dr. Wagner in Radiology. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Great work today, Millin. 
 A lot of interns can 
 regurgitate a textbook, 
 but not many can talk 
 to a patient like you. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 What? 
 I-I've just never had someone 
 compliment my work before. 
 It's safe to say I-I grew up 
 a little left of normal. 
 My parents taught me 
 to clear energy fields 
 and roll a joint at . 
 That kind of reputation 
 didn't exactly pave the way for success. 
 Well, coming from someone 
 who didn't have 
 the most conventional 
 upbringing, either... 
 you saved that woman's life today. 
 You could've walked away, 
 but you didn't. 
 You stayed and listened, 
 and Sierra is better off for it. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 Excuse me. 
 ... and not to mention, 
 I've just come off 
 an award-winning research 
 project on Parkinson's, 
 which will boost the profile 
 of this hospital 
 if I'm the new chief. 
 Are you asking for anything 
 specific in the offer? 
 Well, I would need 
 twice the existing rate 
 and full flexibility 
 to travel to visiting labs. 
 Also, I found out what they're 
 paying at Seattle Pres. 
 You should be a little embarrassed. 
 [PAPER UNFOLDING] 
 Why do you have to visit other labs 
 when we have a lab right here for you? 
 I don't need to go anywhere. 
 [SIGHS] 
 ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 
 I'm sorry, Dr. Shepherd. 
 I'm unable to consider your application. 
 I've already offered the job 
 to Dr. Altman. 
 [SIGHS] 
 % above your existing rate, 
 a full-time administrative 
 assistant, and a stipend. 
 A 
 small 
 stipend.

 Hi! Good morning, everyone! 
 Ah. So, I'm Dr. Miranda Bailey. 
 And I'm thrilled to 
 welcome you to Grey-Sloan 
 as our inaugural class 
 of out-of-state OB/GYN 
 reproductive healthcare 
 and advocacy fellows. 
 You have traveled from Idaho, Arkansas, 
 Texas, even Tennessee to be with us. 
 And I know you'd rather be 
 getting this clinical experience 
 in your own residency programs, 
 but we are honored to offer 
 this rotation in abortion care. 
 Because how else 
 are you going to learn, right? 
 You've all chosen 
 OB/GYN as your specialty, 
 and now your respective 
 states are restricting 
 how you practice that specialty. 
 But we are here to make sure you 
 get the education that you need. 
 I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Addison Montgomery. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 And I've been to some of your states. 
 I've seen the desperation. 
 I've seen the pain, 
 seen the heartbreak. 
 I've seen lives lost. 
 So, anyway, who's ready to get to work? 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 - Come with me. This is Dr. Jo Wilson. 
 - WOMAN: Hey. 
 How come we don't get to 
 work directly with Montgomery? 
 We did. We made sex-ed videos. 
 Yeah, that was before 
 she was a rock star. 
 Did you see the 
 Chicago 
 Tribune 
 story about her? 
 It's our hospital. It's not right. 
 Well, neither is having 
 to go to another state 
 to get fully trained in your specialty. 
 I'm just saying we are five feet away. 
 We could join them. [SIGHS]

 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 Uh... 
 Uh, sorry. Um... 
 - Why is she here? 
 - Right. 
 Uh, she's here today for 
 a single lung transplant 
 from a directed donor. 
 Are you sure she 
 shouldn't stay on the list, 
 hold out for two lungs 
 rather than the one? 
 She's been on the list for 
 two years without matching, 
 and her condition is worsening. 
 A single lung will help prevent her 
 from deteriorating into heart failure. 
 You're just mad RJ's the match. 
 My boyfriend offers to save 
 my life over a Sunday dinner, 
 and she answers by asking 
 if he's finally finished his degree. 
 We were both feminist-studies majors. 
 Men only major in that to meet women. 
 Go ahead. 
 Say it. I'm a... 
 - You're sexist. 
 - Yeah. Mm-hmm. 
 And if he didn't major in 
 that, we would've never met, 
 and I wouldn't be getting a lung today. 
 Are you? 
 Where is he? Who's late for surgery? 
 Surgeons, actually. It 
 happens all the time. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Uh, maybe not that much. 
 Well, I'm sure he'll be here soon. 
 We're not gonna start without him. 
 Well, obviously. 
 Adams, let us know when he arrives.

 OWEN: When did we 
 reorganize our triage orders? 
 And who categorized 
 our patients this way? 
 Yeah. That might have been me. 
 I was running the ER last week, 
 and they weren't quite right 
 according to how we do it 
 upstairs in cardio, so... 
 Oh, did you check and 
 see if it was quite right 
 for us down here in 
 the trauma department? 
 Okay. Everyone, listen up. 
 Just in case there is any confusion, 
 I am back as Chief of Trauma. 
 Do you want to know what else is back? 
 The way I used to do things. 
 And I want to return to 
 our old triage protocols 
 and revert back to 
 my old filing systems. 
 Any questions, comments, concerns? 
 - Hey. 
 - Dr. Ndugu bought us lunch on Fridays. 
 Will that continue? 
 Huh! Well... 
 I'd be happy to let Dr. Ndugu 
 continue to buy you 
 all lunch on Fridays.

 And even a surgical abortion 
 is, um, not gonna happen for you. 
 No. No, no, no.

 - I-I know. 
 I-I'm sorry. 
 [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
 Uh, the scans are in. 
 Let's, uh... Let's 
 take a look, shall we? 
 I'm seeing multiple 
 displaced rib fractures 
 and a massive hemothorax 
 on the right side. 
 OWEN: Once I place the chest 
 tube, we'll rush him up to CT. 
 WINSTON: Right. Agree. 
 And then to the OR, depending 
 on his chest tube output. 
 He has a bad lung contusion. I'm not 
 sure how long he'll remain stable. 
 Ryan Jenkins. Our... Our 
 patient's already in the system. 
 What? Like he's been here before? 
 Like he's supposed to be here today. 
 Directed lung donor, OR . 
 Recipient's Jessica Hall. 
 That's Maggie's patient. 
 She's been waiting on a 
 transplant for almost two years. 
 [WEAKLY] Jess... Jess... 
 Just take... take my... my lung. 
 - Take... Just take... 
 - OWEN: He's hemorrhaging! 
 - [MONITOR ALARM] 
 - Take it. 
 - O's dropped to s. 
 - Damn it. 
 Let's get an intubation tray. 
 Hang two units of blood. 
 As soon as he's tubed, we're 
 heading straight to the OR. 
 Here's the blood. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 Are you sure it's him? 
 Can I... Can I see him? 
 Ryan had his driver's license on him... 
 RJ. He goes by RJ. 
 Either way, it's him. 
 Dr. Hunt, our trauma surgeon, 
 is prepping him for surgery now. 
 He needs surgery? What kind of surgery? 
 RJ suffered some injuries to his chest, 
 and he's lost a 
 significant amount of blood. 
 Oh, my God. 
 His chest... Is it his h-heart? 
 It's his lungs. 
 How fast was he driving? 
 Are you serious? 
 Are you really asking 
 that question right now? 
 [GASPS] 
 - [COUGHING] 
 - Okay. Jessica, Jessica. 
 - Okay. 
 - [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 I know this is a lot to take in. 
 But due to the severity 
 of RJ's injuries, 
 he's not going to be able 
 to donate a lung today. 
 Or possibly ever. 
 I don't... I don't care about that. 
 - Jessica. 
 - Please get out. 
 I can't... I can't 
 listen to you right now. 
 Please get out, Mom. 
 And please... please save him. 
 - Do whatever it takes. 
 - I'll do everything I can. 
 [GULPS] 
 Let's, um... Let's give her a minute. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 A vaginal ultrasound helps determine 
 how far along the pregnancy is. 
 You are counseling the 
 patient, not persuading, okay? 
 Offer the facts, answer questions, 
 give options, okay? 
 That's the mifepristone. 
 It'll block your body's own progesterone 
 to stop the pregnancy from growing. 
 After you take that, 
 we'll start you on the misoprostol. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 If you're not sure, you can take 
 some time and think about it. 
 I'm sure. I just don't like pills. 
 Okay. [CHUCKLES] 
 I'm two years older 
 than my mom was when she had me. 
 She was married, 
 they lived in a townhome, 
 and when I look back at pictures, 
 she seems like a grown-up. 
 But I'm not there yet. 
 I'm still working through the 
 lasting damage she did to me. 
 So maybe one day I will be 
 mentally ready to take that on. 
 But right now, I can't. 
 ‚ô™ Do you think that 
 you're the only one? ‚ô™ 
 I can't be a mother. 
 But I 
 can 
 be an aunt. 
 I can and will be the most 
 incredible aunt to your baby. 
 Do you want me to play you some music? 
 I made you a playlist. 
 For my abortion? 
 - You made me one for when I give birth. 
 - ‚ô™ To find your way back home ‚ô™ 
 So different. 
 Okay. Cards it is. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 No. No, no, no, no. 
 I'm trying to... I'm trying 
 to pay, not stop service. 
 H-Hello? 
 Oh. Y-Yeah... Yeah. Can I... Can I... 
 Can I just give you 
 my account number or... 
 Adams. 
 Uh, how long have you 
 been standing there? 
 Long enough that you 
 should've hung up the phone. 
 Come up with a plan for how you 
 would adjust Jessica's treatment 
 and meds in order to 
 prevent heart failure. 
 She'll need discharge paperwork 
 since she's not getting 
 a transplant today. 
 Do you need to be writing this down? 
 Uh, sure. Uh... 
 She will remain on the UNOS list, 
 but we'll have to send over 
 her pre-op labs and scans 
 in order to make sure that 
 her status hasn't changed. 
 Uh, yeah. Got it. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Everything all right? 
 Uh, fine. Fine. 
 I'm just working with 
 Marsh and Pierce today, 
 and, uh, she's on my case. 
 Uh, p-pass code... Do you... 
 Do you know the pass code 
 to the gas-company 
 account for the house? 
 Uh, Meredith and Maggie 
 handle the utilities. 
 Did you ask Maggie? 
 Could you? 'Cause she's 
 already kind of annoyed with me. 
 No, because then I would have 
 to be annoyed with you, too. 
 Okay. Fine. 
 WOMAN ON P.A.: 
 Dr. Cameron 
 to the step-down unit. 
 Dr. Cameron to the step-down unit. 
 All this scrubbing is 
 drying out my hands. 
 At least the water's warm. 
 Well, you know, my place 
 isn't too far from the house. 
 - You can come use 
 - all the hot water you want. 
 My roommate's pretty cool. You 
 won't want to have sex with her. 
 What? 
 Adams. 
 Is that what he's telling people? 
 We didn't sleep together. 
 We just... kissed maybe twice. 
 Wow. Uh, I was bluffing. 
 But now that we're here, was it good? 
 - Good kissing? 
 - I'm engaged. 
 - Right, right. 
 - All right. 
 Trey is a good guy. He is stable. 
 He's a grown-up who 
 pays his bills on time. 
 And he makes me happy. 
 Kiss was that good, huh? 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Bed  is asking for a 
 birth-control implant. 
 - I'm gonna show Yasuda how to do that. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 And Kwan is finishing 
 an STD test in bed , 
 so that'll be opened up soon. 
 Okay. Let me know 
 if you need help. Okay. 
 And I want to let 
 you 
 know 
 how excellent these trainees are. 
 They 
 should 
 be. 
 They were picked 
 from more than  applicants. 
 You know, one of them wrote 
 that the one silver lining 
 of 
 not 
 being able 
 to get this training at home 
 is being able to learn from 
 the great Addison Montgomery. 
 Oh. Well, that's very kind. 
 No. It's true. You know it is. 
 You know, we could 
 run trainings... every month 
 if you want to come back. 
 I don't know. 
 No. Okay. I know that 
 you're busy with the clinic 
 and... and the travel 
 from Illinois to L.A. 
 must be just, you know, hard. 
 And of... of course, um, 
 visiting your family takes priority. 
 But, you know, we'd love to have you 
 [CHUCKLES] if you could squeeze us in. 
 - [GLASS SHATTERS] 
 - [GASPS] 
 Oh, my God! 
 [CROWD SHOUTING] 
 ADDISON: Oh, my God. 
 Hey. Everybody get down. 
 Down, down. 
 Okay. You're bleeding. 
 He's bleed... Oh, my God! 
 No one goes in or out of 
 the clinic... not till I have 
 enough security to safely evacuate. 
 Okay. Thanks, Bailey. 
 A brick was thrown through 
 the window of the clinic? 
 With ""Montgomery murders"" written on it. 
 - It hit Kwan in the head. 
 - How bad is it? 
 Have you read these manuals? 
 - Cover to cover. 
 - You know what? 
 If I had to read giant manuals 
 for every crisis in Iraq, 
 I wouldn't have made it out of Iraq. 
 Altman, you're supposed to read them 
 when you're 
 not 
 in a crisis. 
 - When is that exactly? 
 - Is Kwan okay? 
 He's bleeding, 
 but he seems to be doing okay. 
 What do the manuals say about 
 a large-scale protest at the clinic? 
 Nothing. 
 They were written before 
 Bailey took over the clinic 
 and before the Supreme 
 Court ruled on 
 Dobbs. 
 - Perfect. 
 - Where are you going? 
 To make sure that no more bricks 
 are thrown at this hospital. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 You're doing it wrong. 
 Y-You should really hold your fingers 
 about  inches away from my face. 
 Just follow the stupid finger. 
 Any dizziness? Changes in your vision? 
 I'm fine. 
 Just put the Steri-Strip on 
 so we can get back to work. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] I am so, so sorry. 
 Pretty sure you didn't throw the brick. 
 I kind of did. 
 I-I posted this this 
 morning on the way here. 
 I assumed it was okay. I'm in Seattle. 
 People believe in reproductive rights. 
 I never thought... 
 People would use it as a road 
 map to Addison Montgomery? 
 They threw a brick at us. 
 What do you think they'll throw next? 
 - Kwan. 
 - I'm sorry. I feel awful. 
 I'm gonna resign from my position. 
 I mean, they're gonna... 
 They're gonna fire me 
 once they find out 
 about the post anyway. 
 Just the idea that I could've 
 endangered the one person 
 that's given me... any 
 hope in these last few weeks 
 makes me sick. 
 But for the first time in months, 
 today I woke up proud, 
 because I was joining the fight. 
 We shouldn't have to hide who we are 
 in order to practice medicine. 
 So don't resign. 
 If you do, that means one less doctor 
 has made it their mission to help. 
 And then they win. 
 - [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 - Hilum's intact. 
 Lung's shredded. 
 [CELLPHONES BUZZING, CHIMING] 
 JULES: Uh, they want everyone in the 
 hospital to stay away from the clinic. 
 The ongoing protests 
 have become violent. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - You need to get back downstairs? 
 I will as soon as I figure out 
 where this blood's coming from. 
 Are you gonna do a lower lobe resection? 
 If we do that, then RJ can't be a donor. 
 But that's not the 
 priority. He's bleeding out. 
 All right. Okay. What... 
 What if I use a hilar clamp 
 to temporarily stop the bleeding 
 and do a wedge resection? 
 It will preserve more lung tissue 
 and could allow him to donate 
 the other lung at a later time. 
 If you shut off the 
 circulation from one lung, 
 - won't his pressure t*nk? 
 - Only for a few minutes. 
 A few minutes could cost him his life. 
 Or I could repair the lung by then. 
 [SIGHS] Fine. We got to move fast. 
 Okay, Griffith, get ready with suction. 
 And, Millin, take over retraction, okay? 
 All right. Clamp. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Do you want me to do it? 
 No. I got it. 
 All right. Stapler and lap pads. 
 Patients are getting restless. 
 The woman in bed  threw 
 a granola bar back at me, 
 and I found a trainee 
 crying in the bathroom. 
 She's fine, but she's scared. 
 I think everyone is. 
 BAILEY: Oh. 
 [CROWD SHOUTING IN DISTANCE] 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Um, team meeting... right now. 
 Okay. Guys, come. Come, come. 
 Everybody here? Okay. 
 Um, so, this clinic is named for my mom, 
 Elena Bailey, because... 
 When I was, uh, , I went with 
 my mom to the grocery store, 
 and, uh, we got in line 
 behind a young woman 
 and [CHUCKLES] her fussy baby. 
 Um, for whatever reason, 
 the woman didn't have 
 enough money to pay her bill, 
 so my mom did. 
 And later, I asked my 
 mom, ""Do you know her?"" 
 And she said, ""I know her enough 
 to know that she's struggling. 
 And when we can help someone 
 else going through a tough time, 
 we should."" 
 These are tough times. 
 We are struggling as doctors, 
 as advocates for women's 
 health and reproductive freedom. 
 We need to help each other, right? 
 We need to lift each other up. 
 That's how we get through. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 Dr. Montgomery has been 
 on the front line, right? 
 Traveling all over the country. 
 Do you have any advice 
 for our young doctors? 
 Excuse me? Someone? A doctor maybe? 
 - Yeah. 
 - I think her water just broke. 
 Oh. Um, you heard her. 
 [LAUGHING] Let's go! 
 Okay. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 Oh, are those, uh, 
 Jessica's discharge papers? 
 Crap. I-I still need to print them. 
 Sorry. 
 That's okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 That's okay. 
 Meredith left. 
 I'm aware. 
 And now I don't know 
 what I'm even doing here. 
 Hm. 
 I just... I keep screwing up. 
 With patients, with... with papers. 
 And I-I can't even pay my gas bill, 
 and, um... 
 I-I-I want to believe that 
 I'm here on my own merit, 
 but I keep wondering if 
 I'm just here because of her 
 and not because I'm supposed to be. 
 Right. 
 Okay. So... 
 we were supposed 
 to do a-a directed donation today. 
 Our patient fasted. Our donor fasted. 
 We were prepped and ready. 
 It was a transplant 
 surgeon's dream scenario. 
 And then RJ gets hit by a car. 
 And in a brutal coincidence, 
 that accident injures 
 the very organ we need. 
 Yeah. Is this story supposed 
 to be about me somehow? 
 I'm saying... the things you worry about 
 are almost never the 
 things that really go wrong. 
 And the things that do go wrong... 
 you couldn't have dreamt up. 
 Your aunt did not accept 
 you to this program 
 out of sentimentality. 
 She's too good for that, and so are you. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 Get Jessica her discharge papers, okay? 
 Yeah. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 He... 
 [SNIFFLES] I'm sorry. I just... 
 ...needed a breath, and I, uh... 
 and I can't go outside, so... 
 Oh. 
 Um, you know, there's this woman 
 that stands outside 
 the clinic every Tuesday 
 with a sign that says, 
 ""Please don't do this."" 
 She doesn't, you know, 
 yell or try to get in the way. 
 Even her sign's polite. 
 And it's still upsetting. 
 I can't even imagine doing 
 what you're doing out there. 
 I got a bulletproof vest. 
 - A what? 
 - [LAUGHING] Yeah. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Okay. 
 An old O.B. friend of mine 
 in Texas, uh, suggested it. 
 I thought she was overreacting. 
 Then I found out her usual 
 advice is to carry a g*n 
 or hire a bodyguard with a g*n. 
 Clinics are being set on fire. 
 I know. 
 You know, staff are having 
 acid thrown in their face 
 on their way to work. 
 With the PRT, they... they just... 
 They broke one of the windows. 
 Don't worry. I had it replaced. 
 I'm not worried about the window. 
 They doxxed me. 
 All of my information is online... 
 My home address, my cellphone number. 
 I got over  calls in one night. 
 Then they broke into our garage 
 and graffitied Jake's car. 
 So now he and Henry are 
 staying at his sister's, 
 so, you know, mom of the year. 
 That sounds awful, and I am so sorry 
 that I suggested that 
 you go out there... 
 No, no. Don't you... Don't be sorry. 
 I wouldn't have done 
 anything differently. 
 I'm not gonna... 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 I'm not gonna quit. I can't quit. 
 I mean, patients need 
 this care, you know? 
 But I-I put my family 
 in danger. I put... 
 Your clinic is in danger. 
 You are in danger because of me. 
 You... And how am I gonna 
 go tell these new OBs 
 that they're gonna be okay when I'm not? 
 I am exhausted. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] I am terrified. 
 - I'm not okay. 
 - Oh, honey. 
 Oh. 
 - [SOBBING] 
 - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. 
 Come on. It's okay. It's okay. 
 It's okay. 
 Oh. 
 MARCUS: 
 We're setting up an incident 
 command post with PD now. 
 North parking lot. 
 Copy that. Thanks, Marcus. 
 Have you heard from the clinic? 
 Jo's not responding to texts. 
 You need somebody to go over there? 
 That is exactly what I do 
 not 
 need someone to do. 
 Well, have you 
 considered closing to trauma? 
 - Not yet. 
 - I really think you should... 
 The media will probably 
 want a statement. 
 Do you want me to work on one? 
 Dr. Altman, 
 there's a situation with the clinic... 
 All right. Everybody stop! 
 I need to be able to think, 
 which is impossible to do 
 when everyone is coming 
 at me at the same time. 
 So can you please quiet your voices 
 so I can hear the one in my head? 
 Okay. Whatever helps. 
 What is going on? 
 Did you want the voice in 
 your head to answer or... 
 Talk, Schmitt. 
 They're clinic patients, 
 but the protesters wouldn't 
 let them in, so they came here. 
 They have appointments for their 
 annual Pap smears, glucose tests, 
 cervical-cancer screenings, STD panels. 
 Do I just... send them home? 
 No. 
 Do you want to help? 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] 
 All right. How we doing? 
 She's fully dilated. 
 Andra, it's time to push. 
 Oh, my God. We're doing this. 
 No, no, no, we're not. 
 We're not doing this. 
 - Andra, the baby's coming. 
 - Well, tell her no! 
 This is not how this 
 is supposed to happen. 
 I don't have my epidural. 
 I don't have my husband. 
 I don't have Dr. Kiu. 
 Her OB. It's okay. 
 You have like...  other doctors here. 
 And I'm here. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] But I paid 
 for the upgraded delivery room, 
 with the soft lighting 
 and the comfy chair! 
 And I'm supposed to have my warm blanket 
 that my mom sent from Maine. 
 And... And... And what 
 about the delivery playlist? 
 My baby's supposed to 
 be born to sounds of joy. 
 Instead I have this starchy sheet 
 and a chorus of protesters, 
 and all I can hear is 
 ""Baby k*ller. Baby k*ller."" 
 [SOBS] So please, do not make me push.

 Andra, are you ready to push? 
 Good. Push. 
 Let's push. 
 [SCREAMS] 
 All right. Reload stapler. 
 Vitals are dropping. BP's in the s. 
 Okay. Keep suctioning. 
 Systolic's in the s. 
 - We gotta move. 
 - All right. There are tears everywhere. 
 Overload him with fluids. 
 We have to work faster. 
 Saying that over and 
 over won't make it happen. 
 - - prolene. 
 - [MONITOR ALARM] 
 What are you doing? Hold my hand. 
 You're gonna want to remember this! 
 How could I forget... Aah! Oh! 
 Good. 
 - Okay, Andra. Stop pushing for a moment. 
 - Okay. 
 What? 
 Head's bobbing. 
 Okay. You... You switch. 
 You and Bailey apply pressure. 
 - May I? 
 - Sure. 
 Andra, I'm Dr. Montgomery. 
 - Do you know what you're having? 
 - A girl. 
 Good. She's about to 
 welcomed by about  women. 
 And you. Get more ice chips. 
 Okay. Andra, your 
 baby's shoulder is stuck. 
 But Dr. DeLuca and Dr. Wilson 
 are going to bring your 
 knees back into your chest, 
 and Dr. Bailey's going to 
 apply pressure to your abdomen, 
 and I'm gonna take her out. 
 - You promise? 
 - I promise. 
 All right. We ready? 
 You ever hear the joke 
 about how many doctors it 
 takes to deliver a baby? 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 All right. Ready? Push. 
 [GROANING] 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 Okay. Let's see. 
 Oh, let's go this way. 
 ‚ô™ Sometimes your life feels 
 like a broken roller coaster ‚ô™ 
 over . Very good. 
 ‚ô™ A thousand useless moving parts ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Sometimes you spend your nights ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Too scared of getting closer ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Hiding out in the 
 back seat of your car ‚ô™ 
 All right. I've got 
 your discharge paperwork. 
 Can I stay a little longer? 
 I want to be here 
 when RJ wakes up from surgery. 
 I want to see him. 
 ‚ô™ The clouds are in your head ‚ô™ 
 Systolic's in the s. 
 He's about to code. 
 All right. Done! Removing the clamp. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Pressure is coming back up. 
 Okay, Millin. What is the next 
 step after this clamp's removed? 
 We ventilate the lung, and then 
 we wait to see if it inflates. 
 - And if it doesn't, Griffith? 
 - Means there's still a leak, 
 which you'll have to repair 
 and then continue to monitor 
 the chest tube for air leaks post-op. 
 - Good. 
 - All right. It's off. 
 You can ventilate. 
 ‚ô™ Hold on ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 'Cause somebody loves you ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ You know trouble's 
 always gonna be there ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Don't let it bring 
 you to your knees, yeah ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Look up ‚ô™ 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 ‚ô™ Look up ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ Hold on ‚ô™ 
 - Okay. We're almost there. 
 Andra, I need one more push. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 I don't think I can do this anymore. 
 You can. I know you can. 
 Okay. Ready? 
 Push. 
 [GROANING] 
 Yes! 
 [BABY CRYING] 
 [LAUGHS] There she is! 
 There! 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Ready to see your baby? 
 [BABY CRYING] 
 [SOBBING] 
 She's perfect. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 There you go. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Look up ‚ô™ 
 Hi, baby. [LAUGHS] 
 ‚ô™ Look up ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ There's flowers in your hair ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Hold on ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ 'Cause somebody loves you ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ You know trouble's 
 always gonna be there ‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ Don't let it bring you to your knees ‚ô™ 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 ‚ô™ Look up ‚ô™ 
 Hey. Is it okay if she... 
 Of course. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ All these changes feel like death ‚ô™ 
 Can... Can I touch him? 
 SIMONE: Absolutely. 
 ‚ô™ Yet my heart... ‚ô™ 
 Dr. Ndugu was able to stop the bleeding 
 and only had to remove 
 minimal lung tissue. 
 We'll see how he recovers, 
 but RJ may still be able to be a donor. 
 I don't care about that. 
 He just needs to be okay. 
 ‚ô™ I can see my breath ‚ô™ 
 You remember our first kiss? 
 Under that street lamp on th? 
 We were arguing over some essay, and... 
 I just leaned in and went for it. 
 ‚ô™‚ô™ 
 And when you kissed me back... 
 no one had ever kissed 
 me like that before. 
 You changed my life in an instant. 
 ‚ô™ Metamorphosis ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Give it a little more time ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ A little more time ‚ô™ 
 - ‚ô™ My wet wings, they will dry ‚ô™ 
 - Thank you. 
 Teddy. 
 Hi. 
 The clinic overflow setup looks great. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Oh, you're welcome. 
 I'm just glad we didn't have 
 to turn those patients away. 
 - Mm. 
 - Today was a tough day. 
 I mean, people had

 the most important thing... 
 Keeping everyone safe. 
 You did well, Altman.

 Thank you. 
 You were, uh, 
 an excellent choice for chief. 
 Are you complimenting yourself now, sir? 
 I believe I am. 
 ‚ô™ Here I go ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ Oh, pain and growth, 
 you feed my soul ‚ô™

 ‚ô™ Ooh, ooh, ooh ‚ô™ 
 Seattle PD's almost finished

 We should be able to exit 
 folks out the back soon. 
 Oh! Music to my ears! [LAUGHS] 
 Oh. Um, get Kwan and Yasuda 
 to help you organize people. 
 - Last thing we need 
 - is a stampede out the door. 
 We heard. 
 Not that we were eavesdropping. 
 - Come on. 
 - ‚ô™ Give it a little more time ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ A little more time ‚ô™ 
 I made you a Montgomery Mix... 
 Orange, cranberry, and apple juice... 
 To keep your blood sugar up. 
 I made one for you, too. 
 - Thank you. 
 - How are you feeling? 
 A little crampy but okay. 
 How about you? 
 Relieved. Tired. 
 Maybe a little delirious.

 It was the hardest thing 
 I've ever done in my life.

 NICK: Adams. 
 We should start her back 
 on a combination therapy 
 with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
 and an antifibrotic agent. 
 I confirmed she's been 
 vaccinated against influenza 
 and pneumococcal infection. 
 And I arranged consults for 
 physical therapy and G.I... 
 For Jessica. 
 I mean, this could buy her 
 time for a transplant, right? 
 Yes. That is exactly right. 
 Yeah. 
 I wish I had just said 
 all that to Pierce. 
 [CHUCKLES] Yeah. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You know, it took me four 
 times to get through the MCATs 
 and get into med school... four times. 
 - Seriously? 
 - Yes. 
 I didn't want to sit through the test. 
 The standardized questions 
 felt like an absurd way 
 to measure one's ability 
 to take care of people. 
 I-I would sit there, 
 I would fixate on that, 
 and at some point... wshh! 
 I'd get up, and I'd... I'd go. 
 But it worked out, right? 
 It worked out only because 
 someone helped me figure it out. 
 Come here. Sit down. 
 Come on. Take this. 
 I'm gonna show you how 
 to present to Pierce 
 - in a way that she needs to hear it. 
 - Okay. 
 Ignore everything else around 
 you except for the case. Everything. 
 Fewer words, fewer details. 
 Now, present me the patient, name first. 
 You're gonna do it twice with 
 the chart and once from memory. 
 - All right. 
 - Let's go. 
 Uh, Jessica Hall, .

 No. I'm taking a break

 I'm about to hit the cafeteria. 
 I haven't eaten since this morning. 
 Hey, what do you think about a 
 doughnut bar instead of a wedding cake? 
 Aw, you hate it. Okay. I'll stop. 
 No, no. I just... 
 I think we should get 
 married before June. 
 Uh, like April, May? 
 Or like next month. 
 Oh. Wow. Okay. 
 I want to do it while my 
 grandma can still come. 
 We could do it in my grandma's backyard. 
 It's not Rock Hills Farm, but 
 I think it'd mean a lot to her. 
 And to me. 
 You hate me. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - 
 No. 
 I love you. 
 And I'll get to be your 
 husband that much sooner. 
 And it will be better 
 than a bougie mansion,

 And we need to find a great...

 I'll stop. 
 - No. Go ahead.

 We can be 
 stubborn and competitive. 
 We don't like to lose. 
 - Protesters still out there? 
 - Uh, just a few. 
 PD arrested some 
 and pushed the rest back, so... 
 All right. Um, well, after this consult, 
 I'll run back up there and check on RJ. 
 That's was an amazing save today, Ndugu. 
 I don't know 
 if you were still considering 
 the vascular fellowship, 
 but [SIGHS] patients would 
 suffer if you went back 
 to being a student in the OR.

 Uh, no bleeding, no fractures... 
 No traumatic brain injuries. 
 Then can someone get me out 
 of here so I can go back to work? 
 Not so fast. You could be concussed, 
 so you should go home. 
 I live alone. 
 If I go home and fall asleep, 
 I could die and no one would know. 
 Okay, fine, but you 
 need to be supervised 
 and undergo regular neuro checks. 
 Wha... I-I don't want to supervise him. 
 Well, I don't care. 
 He can't do any procedures or scrub in. 
 Only let him do notes 
 and patient intake. 
 And page if he has any 
 dizziness or headaches.

 Hello?

 Did you need something? 
 No, I just wanted to check in.

 Well, Mr. Lingenfelser's post-op 
 cardiac index is improving. 
 I think we can discharge in the morning. 
 Okay, that's good. 
 I was actually checking on 
 you. 
 Uh... 
 Is everyone okay? 
 Uh, there's a pregnant 
 doctor who might not be. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 I just... 
 I cannot process this, so I just 
 need to focus on my patients. 
 Like, if I keep telling 
 myself that everything is fine, 
 then eventually, that 
 will make it true, right? 
 Yeah. The world doesn't make 
 a whole lot of sense right now. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 Oh, uh, 
 Sound Science 
 sent copies of the issue 
 for the partial heart 
 transplant feature. 
 - So I left one for you in the lounge. 
 - Oh. 
 What did you think? 
 - You didn't read it? 
 - I got paged as soon as I started it. 
 But I'm sure you did great. 
 Winston. 
 Yeah? 
 Thanks for checking in. 
 ""M"" as in ""Mary"", ""I"" as in 
 ""Igloo"", ""L"" as in ""Larry."" 
 Yes, Ms. Anderson. 
 I have paged Dr. Millin, but 
 Dr. Yasuda should have done your intake. 
 - Max? 
 - Where did she... 
 Jules! 
 - What are you doing here? 
 - Being paranoid. 
 Norma needs a knee replacement. 
 Maxine thinks she's a doctor. 
 Ms. Douglas, your knee 
 is 
 very swollen. 
 - You see? I told you. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 We heard some doctors got hit by a car. 
 Was that you? 
 No, no. 
 Uh, I'm okay, but 
 thanks for your concern. 
 Ms. Douglas, have you 
 had a fall recently? 
 - No. 
 - Any history of gout, 
 rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis? 
 - Unh-unh. 
 - Okay. 
 Dr. Millin, page ortho for her knee. 
 Wait. She won't tell you, but I will. 
 It burns when she pees. 
 Norma! 
 Max, you have to say something. 
 Remember what happened last time? 
 Could be another UTI.

 cup for a urinalysis. 
 Anything else? 
 Orange spice tea? 
 - You know the one I like. 
 - I'll see what I can do.

 Your grandma's a piece of work. 
 Oh, Max isn't my grandma. 
 She's my roommate. 
 BRANDON: 
 How severe are her injuries? 
 BAILEY: Uh, we won't know 
 until we get her into the O.R., 
 but your wife has lost a lot of blood. 
 Dr. Bailey, I've been married 
 to a doctor for five years. 
 I know when you're hedging. 
 Please just tell me what's going on. 
 Okay, uh, Tia went into cardiac 
 arrest in the trauma bay, 
 which forced us to have to 
 perform an emergency C-section. 
 We have a team resuscitating 
 the baby as we speak. 
 The baby? That's our baby? 
 Yes. Your baby. Your... Your son. 
 I will be on the first flight. 
 Do whatever you have to do to save them.

 Please. 
 - You have my word.

 an eye out for Mr. Marwood, 
 and then scrub in.

 [FLASHLIGHT CLICKS] 
 Eh, you're fine. And 
 it's continuous sutures. 
 Okay. 
 - I got a question for you. 
 - Hmm? 
 Why do you live with a   -year-old? 
 Uh, Maxine is   , 
 and I was friends with 
 her grandson in med school. 
 She offered to sublet me her extra room 
 for a third of what I 
 would pay anywhere else. 
 She also makes amazing matzo ball soup 
 and I don't have to worry about 
 being quiet when I come home late 
 because she takes her hearing 
 aids out at night. It's a win-win. 
 - Hi. 
 - So, her knee's okay? 
 According to the X-ray, there 
 is no sign of a fracture. 
 - Told ya. 
 - However, there is a lot of fluid buildup. 
 I'd like to take a sample 
 to rule out septic arthritis. 
 - Can I take a look? 
 - You can look at anything you want. 
 Hey, easy, Norma. 
 For God's sake, Norma. 
 Jules tells me all the time. 
 We can't talk like that anymore. 
 Have you seen him? 
 What do you think, Doc? 
 These popsicle sticks got me all the way 
 to State Championship 
 back in my majorette days. 
 [CHUCKLES] Norma's worse than me. 
 Okay, you ready to learn 
 how to aspirate a knee? 
 - Absolutely. 
 - Uh. 
 I'll do it. Concussions to the back. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Okay, we're gonna tap the knee now. 
 - [WHIMPERS] 
 - I'd like to tap 
 that. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 ‚ô™ 
 [SIGHS] 
 Okay. 
 Oh. Chief Altman! Can I walk with you? 
 If you can walk fast. 
 How are you holding up today? 
 Today must be a crazy day to be chief. 
 I've got Seattle PD 
 and hospital security 
 briefing me every minute, 
 planning for every possible threat. 
 You know, I am really good in a crisis, 
 but no matter how many times 
 you've been in literal warfare, 
 it never gets easier. 
 Also, I haven't eaten in hours, 
 and if one more person mentions 
 ""risk assessment"" or ""liability,"" 
 I might just walk out of 
 here and never come back. 
 Though, I'm kinda feeling 
 better. Thanks for asking. 
 Yeah, I was actually going to 
 ask your advice about something. 
 So, the 
 Sound Science 
 article came out today 
 - about the partial heart transplant. 
 - Congratulations. 
 - Yeah. 
 - I'm looking forward to reading it 
 - once things calm down. 
 - Maybe skip the part where they quoted me 
 saying that I assembled a 
 team of highly skilled 
 assistants, 
 including my husband, Dr. Winston Ndugu. 
 Did you say that? 
 [SIGHS] I also said that 
 he's a highly skilled surgeon 
 and that it was a   /   effort, 
 but they didn't print that. 
 Well, now it looks like 
 you're taking all the credit 
 - and insulting your husband. 
 - Exactly. 
 Alright, how can I 
 help you out with this? 
 Can the hospital ask for a correction? 
 Please. 
 I-I wouldn't ask if this wasn't urgent. 
 Okay, I will put a call 
 into the PR department 
 once I get through today, but, Pierce, 
 you really should talk to your husband. 
 Owen and I didn't talk for months, 
 and it nearly broke us. 
 Do not wait for the hospital 
 to issue a statement. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Okay, let's get started. Sorry I'm late. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Excuse me. 
 ‚ô™ 
 [CHUCKLES] All that chaos 
 outside, and look at her. 
 Not a care in the world. 
 Just putting ears on a potato. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 ‚ô™ 
 Really shifts your 
 perspective, doesn't it? 
 ‚ô™ 
 How's she doing? 
 It's Addison. 
 She isn't listening to 
 anyone, including her own body, 
 so that she can take care of a patient. 
 But I know she's in pain 
 because she's biting her lip, 
 which is something that she does 
 when she's trying to distract 
 herself from something. 
 - Yeah, I know she means a lot to you. 
 - ""A lot"" doesn't describe it. 
 I think the universe felt badly 
 when I got stuck with my 
 three biological sisters, 
 so eventually, it gave me 
 Addison and Meredith and Maggie. 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES, VIBRATES] 
 - Mm. 
 They need me in the ICU. 
 Go. I could stay. 
 I'll observe her range of motion 
 and keep an eye out for that lip bite. 
 She still needs that 
 follow-up X-ray, MRI, 
 and another neurovascular exam. 
 Amelia... 
 I've got her.

 [BREATHING SHAKILY]

 Dr. Yasuda. 
 [SHAKILY] Yeah. 
 Yasuda, are you okay? 
 I don't think I am. 
 - OWEN: She's decompensating. 
 - JO: Her spleen's shattered. 
 Multiple lacerations 
 to the liver, as well. 
 BAILEY: Let's prep for a 
 splenectomy and give her cryo. 
 You know she was our very first 
 applicant for the fellowship? 
 I remember. 
 In the interview, we told her 
 we were concerned her pregnancy 
 could make the timing challenging 
 because she was coming 
 all the way from Tennessee. 
 Then she said, ""I'm 
 about to become a mother. 
 What could be more 
 challenging than that?"" 
 No one could've seen 
 this coming, Bailey. 
 Coming here wasn't a 
 requirement of her program. 
 But she came anyway, while pregnant, 
 because she wanted to 
 help other pregnant women. 
 And today, she became a mother. 
 That's our patient. 
 That's who we're saving. 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 She's coding. Hold on, Tia. 
 - JO: Hang more FFP. 
 - BAILEY: Removing the spleen. 
 [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
 Dr. Bailey, it's yours. 
 It's Tia's husband. 
 Okay, we'll call him when we can. 
 Ugh, she's still bleeding everywhere. 
 Her body can't clot or oxygenate. 
 Liver's still oozing. 
 I just need a little more time 
 to control these bleeders. 
 - Dr. Bailey. 
 - Silence it! 
 - I'm on it. 
 - How are we, Knox? 
 She's severely acidotic. 
 Base deficit is minus   . 
 - I'm giving TXA. 
 - There's blood in her NG tube. 
 JOE: Her temperature's 
 dropping fast. Dr. Hunt? 
 She didn't give up downstairs. 
 I am not giving up in here. 
 If we continue operating, she 
 won't make it out of this O.R. 
 Look, she's acidotic, 
 hypothermic, and coagulopathic. 
 Let's take her to the 
 ICU and give her a break. 
 [SIGHS] Fine. Let's pack her. 
 Give me as much lap pads as you have. 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go.

 I am mortified. 
 I just froze. Surgeons can't freeze. 
 You weren't in an O.R. 
 No, I can't get Tia out of 
 my head, just lying there. 
 And I-I just keep thinking that 
 it could have been any of us. 
 It could've been me. I'm 
 a monster for saying it. 
 You're not. 
 And do not apologize for your 
 reaction to a traumatic event. 
 Today was not normal. 
 It was violent. 
 The clinic was att*cked. 
 You 
 were att*cked. 
 You didn't sign up for that, 
 and that is not what this

 That's what makes you human.

 Don't you have other patients to bother? 
 Oh, Norma and Maxine's 
 prelim test results are in. 
 We have your initial results. 
 Uh, Max, would you like to come with me? 
 Nonsense. Whatever you 
 have to say to one of us, 
 you can say to both of us. 
 Are you comfortable with this? 
 Oh, you know me. 
 I haven't cared about 
 propriety since     . 
 [BOTH WOMEN CHUCKLE] 
 You have gonorrhea. 
 Both of you, if that wasn't... clear. 
 Yours settled in your knee. 
 It's called gonococcal arthritis. 
 Uh, gonorrhea is contracted 
 by having sexual intercourse... 
 We know how you get it. 
 We have to ask you to call 
 all of your sexual partners. 
 Now? 
 I-It's advisable to, um, 
 get anyone who's been exposed 
 treated regardless 
 of their test results. 
 - [SIGHS]

 you were sleeping with someone. 
 You didn't tell me, either. 
 I wanted to, but it's not

 Well, this is awkward.

 I thought we might find you here. 
 Carina's delivering a baby. 
 She operated on the doctor who got hit. 
 She delivered that doctor's baby, 
 and now she's delivering another baby 
 and she's a miracle worker. 
 [CHUCKLES] I don't stop 
 to think about it enough, 
 but my wife is a bringer of life. 
 I'm sorry, I just 
 needed to hear her voice. 
 No, I get it. I get it. 
 It's a scary day. 
 Guess this is what it feels like. 
 - What do you mean? 
 - To be married to us. 
 When you and I found out 
 that something had happened 
 at the clinic, we both ran here. 
 We had to know that they were okay. 
 We had to... Oh. 
 We had to see it. 
 Yeah. My stomach 
 literally went upside down. 
 Like, I-I felt it turn, like, 
 I actually might need surgery. 
 Well, we do that to 
 them on a daily basis. 
 God, it feels awful. We're awful people. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 But they knew what they were 
 getting into, though, right? 
 I think Carina did. 
 Bailey married you when 
 you were still a doctor. 
 Okay, vitals look good. 
 He looks stable for now. 
 Griffith, you need a break? 
 I mean, I'm kinda the one who 
 got hit by a car over here. 
 Sorry. I just... 
 I was in here when I was born. 
 - In the NICU? 
 - In 
 this 
 NICU. 
 My mom was somewhere on another 
 floor, fighting for her life. 
 And I'm just... 
 amazed. 
 Amazed by what? 
 Someone like you did this for me. 
 Someone like you saved my life.

 No breath sounds. Ambu him. 
 Sats are dropping. Do we need an X-ray? 
 There's no time for that. 
 Give me your pen light.

 Okay, and turn that light off. Now. 
 ‚ô™ 
 See how this side lights

 He's got a pneumothorax. I need

 Okay.

 Dr. Bailey from Grey-Sloan. 
 I know you're on a plane right

 Tia has been transferred to the ICU. 
 We're gonna let her 
 rest for a few hours, 
 and then take her back to the O.R. 
 and finish repairing her injuries. 
 [SIGHS] Um... 
 we'll be right here waiting for you. 
 I won't leave her side.

 So, 
 she's

 And she's your ""Well, I'll just go

 She's not a natural blonde. 
 - I am so!

 Norma, you calm down, too. 
 Hal, if you could just sit by Dr. Kwan. 
 Sir, your results should be back soon, 
 but we'd like to give 
 you the shot anyway 
 because you're likely the... source. 
 That's impossible. 
 I am healthy as a horse! 
 The most common STD symptoms 
 are often no symptoms at all.

 All of 'em?

 Oh, geez. 
 Uh... 
 Hazel Rothman, Judy Booth... 
 Oh, yeah. Martha from water aerobics. 
 Not Martha! 
 She's   ! 
 - You're an ageist! 
 - And you're a liar,

 - You son of a bitch! 
 This is officially an outbreak. 
 Contact the housing 
 manager and let them know 
 that the residents are spreading 
 gonorrhea and need tests. 
 - And condoms. 
 - But Millin lives there. 
 Can't she just leave a note on 
 the social halls or something? 
 I don't care. Just 
 somebody let them know. 
 Sooner rather than later. 
 - It's remarkable. 
 - Hmm. 
 It's the resilience, the will to live. 
 Yeah. Never ceases to amaze me. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - Tia? 
 - Stable, for now. 
 And Dr. Lincoln is waiting for you. 
 Yeah. Tell him I'll be there soon. 
 Yeah, see, he said you'd say 
 that, and that I should say 
 if you want to operate again, 
 ""soon"" should be... now. 
 And then, he said that if I 
 couldn't get you to come out, 
 he'd make me pay for it. 
 - Personally. 
 - Oh, my God. 
 Alright. I'm coming. Just... 
 page me if anything 
 changes, immediately.

 No, she's hypotensive

 She's still bleeding from her abdomen.

 You'll have to wear the 
 sling for about four weeks, 
 but keep your elbow, 
 wrist, and hand moving. 
 It'll help. 
 And don't ignore the PT exercises 
 no matter how exhausted you get. 
 Honestly, it... 
 it wouldn't be a terrible idea 
 to take a break from the 
 road for a couple of weeks. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
 - ADDISON: Thank you. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 It's me. 
 Talk to me. 
 You know, the irony... 
 of all of this is that these people 
 are targeting me for the 
 abortion care that I provide 
 when that is actually 
 the least common procedure 
 - I am doing in the PRT. 
 - Mm. 
 I'm mostly providing wellness checks, 
 prenatal care, annual... 
 pelvic exams, pap smears. 
 Since so many clinics have closed 
 in the last several months, 
 I'm the only option they have. 
 It's exhausting.

 It's a disaster. 
 Hmm. 
 And I can't take a break.

 I thought you were gonna 
 throw the tablet at him. 
 Oh, I almost did.

 She's still bleeding out.

 Uh, Pringle maneuver. 
 - Bedside? 
 - Atraumatic clamps, please. 
 Yasuda, put your hand where my hand is. 
 You're gonna hold the bleeding here

 blood flow to the liver. 
 Then I will try and 
 control the bleeding.

 Yeah. Here, I'll help.

 Exactly like that.

 No sexual activity for a week. 
 We want to give the antibiotics

 You already told me, dear. 
 And I heard it when 
 you told Norma and Hal. 
 Just making sure. 
 Can't have a sick roomie. 
 Who else is gonna make me 
 the world's best French toast 
 when I work the night shift? 
 It's all about a drop of vanilla. 
 And I'm sorry that Hal 
 turned out to be such a jerk. 
 Me too. Guys can be pigs. 
 Gay ones, too. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Women can be... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 At first, they tell us 
 not to have sex at all 
 and that we're sluts if we enjoy it. 
 And then they tell 
 us if we get pregnant, 
 we must carry the baby no matter what. 
 And once we're mothers, 
 whether by force or by choice, 
 they judge us for that, too. 
 Because there's certainly no 
 way to be a perfect mother. 
 So, as women, we get judged and att*cked 
 for every single decision we ever make. 
 You want to know the 
 upside of this misogyny, 
 this patriarchy? 
 Women become invisible 
 around the age of   , 
 and then you can do 
 whatever the hell you like, 
 including having a lot of 
 great sex, because no one cares. 
 And now, I have an 
 antibiotic and no regrets. 
 Except, perhaps, for waiting 
 so long to live my best life. 
 See you at home, dear.

 BOTH: A, B, C, D... 
 You've been learning sign language? 
 I... I found an app that 
 teaches the ASL alphabet. 
 Now your face is telling 
 me that I screwed up. 
 - Did I screw up? 
 - I told you that I needed more time. 
 We don't even have her MRI results back, 
 her genetic testing. 
 You're... you're learning sign language? 
 Ben, now, first you 
 save this man in a fire. 
 Now you're sitting at his bedside? 
 You want me to sit with you? 
 No, you... you've got a crisis 
 of your own to deal with. 
 [GROANS] 
 We're going to get through this. 
 - All of it. 
 - Yeah. 
 Mm. 
 [GROANS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 What the... 
 [LAUGHS] Well, who let you in here? 
 Well, I had to restock the PRT, 
 so I thought I'd swing 
 by and say hi to you... 
 Hi... and my favorite patient. 
 You're so adorable, huh? 
 - Yes, you are. 
 - You couldn't get supplies in Illinois? 
 Well, I could. But Illinois 
 just doesn't have Connor, so... 
 - No, they don't. 
 - All right, you've had your fun. 
 My turn. Come on, up, up, up. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Aw. 
 - How is his mom doing? 
 - Better every day. 
 OK. Up now. 
 - Any pain there? 
 - No. 
 Is there any way to speed this up? 
 There's somewhere I have to be. 
 I'm going as fast as I can. 
 Oh, Dr. Adams, Dr. Millin. This is Matt. 
 I just cleared his 
 C-spine, and I just need 
 - you to get him up to CT. 
 - How'd you hurt yourself? 
 - Took a sword to the neck. 
 - A foam sword. 
 It has a plywood core. 
 LARPing accident. 
 Why do you think I 
 would know what that is? 
 Live-action roleplaying. 
 The guys in the park with the swords? 
 Now I see why you 
 think I would know that. 
 If his CT is negative, just 
 keep him here for observation, 
 to make sure that the 
 swelling in his trachea 
 doesn't compromise his airway. 
 Page me if you need anything. 
 Can I please just go now? 
 I feel fine, and this is my only shot 
 to usurp the game master. 
 If I don't get back to the 
 park before sunset, that's it. 
 Well, if your trachea swells up 
 enough that air doesn't reach 
 your lungs, that is also it. 
 Statistically, what are the 
 chances of that happening? 
 Look, no disrespect, but 
 this game is make-believe. 
 Is it worth risking actual death? 
 - Depending on the statistics, maybe. 
 - Oh, I get it now. 
 This is about a girl. 
 Oh my god, not everything is about love. 
 - Princess Astrid of Dungeness. 
 - See? 
 Unbelievable. 
 It was love at first sight. 
 For six years, I've loved her. 
 Today I shall declare it. 
 She is my destiny. 
 Good morning, Mr. Porter. 
 I'm Dr. Webber. 
 This is Dr. Yasuda. 
 We're going to be doing 
 your colonoscopy today. 
 Yasuda? 
 Russell Porter,   . 
 Experiencing unintentional 
 weight loss and anemia. 
 Has a family history of colon cancer. 
 Referred by his PCP for 
 a diagnostic colonoscopy. 
 Are you doing OK? 
 - He doesn't like hospitals. 
 - I'm fine. 
 Well, in about    minutes, you're not 
 going to know where you are. 
 It will be the best nap of your life. 
 Sounds great. 
 - Can I get a colonoscopy too? 
 - [LAUGHTER] 
 Where are we? 
 We're in the hospital, baby. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
 - Get this off of me. 
 - Look, Russell... 
 - Get it off! 
 - Russell, you're OK. 
 Who are you? 
 What... what's happening? 
 Why doesn't he remember who I am? 
 Let's forget about the colonoscopy. 
 And let's get a head CT. 
 - And page Dr. Shepherd, OK? 
 - Yeah. 
 Hi, I'm Dr. Yasuda. 
 Do you want to just come with me... 
 Get away from me. Don't come near me! 
 OK. Oh my god. 
 [SOBBING] Get away from me. 
 Get away from me. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC] 
 - [GROANING] 
 - Any nausea? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 And the pain on your side 
 on a scale of   to   ? 
 most days,   on a bad day. 
 It's got to be stones, right? 
 I've always had trouble with my kidneys. 
 What kind of trouble? 
 Had the right one removed 
 several years back. 
 But the pain is currently on the right? 
 Left. I had the left one removed. 
 - [CHUCKLES] Oh, I'm getting old. 
 - Let's take a look. 
 Hey, is Dr. Bailey working today? 
 I was looking on the internet. 
 It says she's the best doctor 
 here for kidney problems. 
 Think I could see her? 
 She's busy, but I'll put in a page. 
 In the meantime, we'll take some urine 
 samples and some images, 
 and we'll know more. 
 Oh, thanks. I just don't want to 
 mess around with the only kidney 
 I have left, you know? 
 [SIGHS] 
 What are you doing? 
 Exercise. 
 Tox screen is negative. 
 Bloodwork only shows anemia 
 and mild renal impairment. 
 Hmm. 
 Grace said Russell's been experiencing 
 some brain fog lately. 
 Pretty mild, until today. 
 She chalked it up to a stress at work. 
 - [SCANNER BEEPING] 
 - Ah. 
 Well, head scans are negative. 
 Are those what I think they are? 
 Russell, we see some 
 b*ll*ts in your scan. 
 - When did you get shot? 
 - [SIGHS]    years ago. 
 Went to the grocery 
 store for taco seasoning, 
 came out with three g*nsh*t wounds. 
 Can you imagine? 
 Surviving a sh**ting and then having 
 to walk around with metal inside you 
 for the rest of your life? 
 What were his symptoms, again? 
 Anemia, fatigue, weight loss. 
 And now he's exhibiting 
 brain fog, confusion. 
 - I'll... I'll go test his lead levels. 
 - Put a rush on it. 
 He's been off the oscillator 
 for three days now, 
 and they're minimizing 
 the vent settings. 
 [PHONE BUZZING] 
 You're still getting calls? 
 You know, someone's 
 heart stops on my table, 
 I'm... cool as a cucumber. 
 But the phone rings, 
 and I... shake. I... I shake. 
 Because it's terrifying. 
 They're harassing you, 
 and it's relentless. 
 Ben almost died on duty 
 the other day, again. 
 So terrifying in my life has layers. 
 Like, when the phone rings, 
 I don't know what I should 
 - be panicking about first. 
 - [PHONE BUZZES] 
 And it never stops ringing. 
 [SIGHS] I just hope 
 to god these lunatics 
 will move on before I 
 have a second heart attack. 
 Wait a minute. You had a heart attack? 
 How did I not know about this? 
 - When? 
 - Years ago. 
 It... look, it's... it's fine. 
 I'm fine. Everything is fine. 
 If you're using fine as a stand-in 
 for another four-letter word, I can get 
 - on board with that analysis. 
 - OK. Nothing's fine. 
 This helps, though. 
 Yeah. 
 Well, I find there's not much 
 that a roomful of babies can't fix. 
 And old friends. 
 This is Dr. Hunt, our 
 head of trauma surgery 
 and an expert at 
 treating g*nsh*t victims. 
 I don't understand. 
 What does this have 
 to do with his colon? 
 Nothing. 
 As it turns out, based on his bloodwork, 
 Russell has lead poisoning. 
 The b*llet fragments in his chest 
 and his spine have been leaching lead 
 into his bloodstream 
 and his spinal fluid. 
 That explains all of your symptoms... 
 The intermittent confusion, 
 the forgetfulness. 
 Just like the episode 
 you had earlier today. 
 But the surgeon said it was 
 riskier to take the b*ll*ts 
 out than to leave them in. 
 Most of the time that is true. 
 The body forms scar 
 tissue around the b*ll*ts, 
 preventing lead from getting 
 into the blood and the spinal fluid. 
 But in some cases, like 
 yours, that scar tissue 
 never forms and the best course 
 of action is to remove them. 
 So you remove the b*ll*ts 
 and my symptoms just go away? 
 Within a few days, your 
 lead levels will drop 
 and your symptoms 
 will gradually improve. 
 - And what about his confusion? 
 - There are no guarantees. 
 It could take weeks, months, even years 
 for the encephalopathy 
 to subside, if at all. 
 So I can go through all this and still 
 can't remember who my wife is? 
 Hey, it's OK. I'm not going anywhere. 
 I'll just keep reminding you, OK? 
 When I heard the g*nshots, 
 I was in the cereal aisle. 
 I tried to find a place to hide, 
 but there was nowhere to go. 
 It was a grocery store. 
 I was totally exposed. 
 So I got down on my knees, and I prayed 
 that I'd make it out alive. 
 But if I would have known 
 how much I'd suffer... 
 I know that feeling, Russell. 
 Listen, I am a survivor 
 of a sh**ting too. 
 Too many of us are. 
 It is a lifelong struggle whether you 
 remove those b*ll*ts or not. 
 So in a way, you have nothing to lose. 
 And who knows... if we can take away 
 some of your physical pain maybe that 
 could help take away some 
 of your other pain too. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 OK. 
 Let's take them out. 
 - OK. 
 - OK. 
 - [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 - Dr. Shepherd? 
 It's Mika Yasuda from Grey Sloan. 
 Dr. Hunt and Dr. Webber 
 told me to come get you. 
 We need a neuro consult. 
 Also, I really have to pee. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Bathroom's over there. 
 - You know what? 
 It was a false alarm. I'm good. 
 Should we get you dressed? 
 Because... wait, wait! Ow! 
 Dr. Hunt says I can't leave without you. 
 Call the backup neurosurgeon on call. 
 We have a patient with a b*llet embedded 
 in his thoracic spine. 
 It has to come out. 
 Dr. Hunt says you're the 
 only one who can do it. 
 Please. 
 - Fine. 
 - Great. 
 Uh, my van is out front. 
 You have to kind of, like, lift 
 and kick the door at the same 
 - time. But you know what... 
 - I'll drive myself. 
 I'll see you there! 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 You hate pregnant women. 
 Don't say that. It makes me 
 sound like an awful person. 
 - But I do feel hives coming on. 
 - Yeah. 
 Uh, I'm just checking on you. 
 Well, I am waiting 
 for Luna's test results 
 to determine whether 
 her hearing loss is due 
 - to an underlying disease. 
 - Yeah, I know. 
 At daycare this morning, 
 there was this mom, 
 and she was fighting with her kid 
 about taking off his bike helmet. 
 And I just... I just wanted to scream, 
 ""This is not a real problem."" 
 And I know it's all... relative. 
 And the truth is, is, I would love it 
 if my biggest problem 
 right now was Luna refusing 
 to take off her bike helmet. 
 Yeah, and don't we want to 
 encourage helmet wearing? 
 I'm going to stop 
 trying to make you laugh. 
 I might have all of 
 these decisions to make... 
 Hearing aids, cochlear implants, 
 sign language, things 
 that will affect her 
 for the rest of her life. 
 And it's not like I can just ask her 
 what she wants in    years. 
 My job as a mom just changed 
 in the blink of an eye, 
 and I don't know if I'm 
 going to be very good at it. 
 I'm not a parent, but 
 I do have to deal with 
 the parents of my patients a lot. 
 So I'm kind of an expert. 
 And what I know is that you are 
 not only good at it, you are great. 
 And you're going to 
 continue being great. 
 You are a great mom. 
 Thanks. 
 Oh, and um, if you need 
 help with sign language, 
 I do know happy birthday, 
 my name is Levi, and, um, butt. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - There. I did it. 
 - My work here is done. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Watch where you're going! 
 What? 
 What? 
 [LAUGHING] Hey. 
 Did Meredith tell you 
 to come check on me? 
 No. I was actually worried about Bailey. 
 Why do I need to check on you? 
 - Uh, you know, I'm... it's fine. 
 - Hey! Come on, Amelia. 
 - It's me. Spit it out. 
 - Um, Mer moved, and then Maggie moved, 
 and then Kai left me. 
 And so I've, um, pretty much 
 been abandoned by everyone. 
 And you know how well I 
 do with abandonment, so... 
 Amelia. 
 - I have a consult. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 We need to remove the 
 spinal b*llet first 
 since it's most likely 
 causing the encephalopathy. 
 What about the scattered 
 fragments in the lung? 
 Can we do a non-anatomic resection 
 of the affected lung tissue? 
 - Yeah, good. 
 - Please, go ahead. Start without me. 
 - We did. 
 - Sorry, I got here as fast as I could. 
 My van doesn't go over   , and I'll... 
 I'll stop talking now. 
 Assuming you can remove 
 the b*llet in the spine... 
 Assuming I can? 
 You woke me up. I assume 
 that you know that I can. 
 Amelia, we really don't have 
 time for whatever this is, OK? 
 You'll go first. 
 We'll remove the b*llet from the spine, 
 irrigate, close, and flip the patient, 
 and then I'll start the thoracotomy. 
 Anything else I should know? 
 Did you want to pick the 
 music for the OR as well? 
 Are there any other options you 
 would like to discuss, Dr. Shepherd? 
 Nope. 
 Dr. Ndugu seems to be in charge here. 
 Let's go with his plan. 
 OK. 
 - Was that... 
 - Definitely not about you. 
 - All right. 
 - OK. 
 Are you experiencing 
 an increase in pain? 
 - Nope. I feel great. 
 - Whoa. 
 - Whoa, where are you going? 
 - To the park. 
 - Do you know where my shoes are? 
 - Hey, no. 
 We need to keep you a little longer, 
 just to make sure 
 you're out of the woods. 
 You're really going to 
 make me wait a full week 
 - to tell Astrid I love her? 
 - What's one more week? 
 - Today when I almost died... 
 - It was a foam sword. 
 I fought to keep breathing with 
 every molecule in my body. 
 I couldn't let myself die 
 without telling Astrid how I feel. 
 You probably think it's crazy, but... I 
 don't even know her real name. 
 But I know her smile, and 
 I know what makes her laugh, 
 and I know her heart. 
 And I have to tell her. 
 Oh, you are full of 
 adrenaline right now. 
 You are not thinking clearly. 
 Or maybe he's thinking clearly 
 for the first time in his entire life. 
 I mean, what if you go to 
 the park and Princess Astrid 
 doesn't feel the same way? 
 Or maybe she's been in love 
 with you this whole time too. 
 - Yeah, I prefer his take. 
 - Stop encouraging him. 
 This game is clearly your... 
 your happy place. 
 Do you really want to trash 
 all of that for a girl whose 
 real name you don't even know? 
 You look like a princess, but 
 you have the heart of an ogre. 
 Correction... I look like a goddess, 
 and I have the heart of a person who 
 tells sad men the whole truth. 
 Or a troll. 
 She has the heart of a troll. 
 I'll give you your shoes 
 back when I discharge you. 
 [SIGHS] 
 The urinalysis and X-ray 
 both came back negative. 
 Next steps? 
 Run an ultrasound to fully 
 rule out kidney stones. 
 Good. What do you need me for? 
 He said he only had one kidney, 
 but there are clearly two in the films 
 and he doesn't have any surgical scars. 
 Also, he asked for you. 
 I told him you were busy, but... 
 Is it... hello, sir. I'm Dr. Bailey. 
 Go ahead, Kwan. 
 - Been looking forward to meeting you. 
 - I'm, uh, flattered. 
 Dr. Kwan is one of our finest interns. 
 He's going to be doing an ultrasound... 
 How are the kids? 
 Oh. 
 Oh, I'm sorry. Have 
 I treated you before? 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 Just a... just a fan. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 How's the new place? 
 Boys settling in OK? 
 Excuse me? 
 Young Pruitt's been through so much. 
 I mean, it would be a real, 
 real shame if something else 
 were to happen. 
 Ultrasound is negative. 
 Uh, you can discharge him now. 
 Oh, now, hang on. Is that 
 how you treat your patients? 
 Sir, sit back... sit down. 
 Or do you only extend common 
 courtesy to other murderers, huh? 
 Come back here. 
 I'm not finished with 
 you, Dr. Baby k*ller! 
 [GRUNTING] 
 - Call security! 
 - Hey! 
 - This isn't over! 
 - Just stay down. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 You know, I thought we were friends. 
 Or at least colleagues 
 who respected each other. 
 Amelia, what is going on? 
 What's going on is, you 
 let one of the only people 
 in the world who cares 
 whether I eat a hot meal 
 or sleep for more than 
 four hours in a night 
 move to Chicago. 
 You know as well as I do 
 that no one let Maggie move. 
 You're her husband, and 
 you let your ego destroy 
 what was once true love. 
 OK. I get that she's your 
 sister, so there are sides here. 
 But that is an oversimplification. 
 Maggie will rise and rise and rise, 
 and she will go on to 
 do even greater things, 
 and you will always be in her shadow. 
 And she may go on to 
 forgive your smallness, 
 because that is how 
 great she is, but I'm not. 
 I won't. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 ‚ô™ 
 If you need anything to make sure 
 that Dr. Bailey is covered at 
 all times, just say the word. 
 Thank you. 
 Chief Altman, I wanted to apologize 
 for attacking that patient. 
 I know there are protocols 
 in these situations... 
 The patient wasn't att*cked. 
 He fell while he was 
 attacking Dr. Bailey. 
 - Um... 
 - That is the story as I heard it. 
 - So this won't go in my file somewhere? 
 - I'm confused. 
 Did something happen between 
 you and the abusive patient? 
 If so, I know nothing about it. 
 - Is that him? Is that him? 
 - Yes. 
 But, Warren, listen to me. 
 We both know that that 
 won't help either of you, OK? 
 That intern over there, he's the one 
 who took the bastard down. 
 Why don't you put this manic 
 energy to better use and go 
 over there and thank him? 
 - Fine. 
 - OK, great. 
 But if you wouldn't 
 mind telling the bastard 
 that Dr. Bailey's husband 
 is a firefighter who breaks 
 into houses with his ax for a living, 
 and I'm going to find out where 
 he lives, I'd appreciate it. 
 OK, I got it. I got it. Thank you. 
 Yasuda, slowly retract 
 to help expose the dura. 
 - I need better visualization. 
 - Retractor. 
 [CLATTERS] 
 - Yasuda. 
 I'm so sorry. I don't 
 know what happened. 
 I'll tell you what happened. 
 You were not paying attention, 
 and our last sterile retractor 
 - is on the floor. Pick it up... 
 - OK. 
 - And get out of my OR. 
 - Is that really necessary? 
 We can get a replacement in one minute. 
 - Do you want to be kicked out too? 
 - I really am so sorry. 
 - It won't happen again. 
 - Not with me, it won't. 
 You are no longer welcome on my service. 
 Out! 
 - Is he... 
 - He's doing great. 
 Dr. Shepherd successfully removed 
 the b*llet from his spine. 
 She's finishing up, and 
 then Dr. Ndugu will start 
 on the fragments in his lung. 
 OK. 
 - That's good, right? 
 - Very good. 
 OK. 
 [SOBS] I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - No. No apologies. 
 It'll be a few hours if you want 
 to go home and get some sleep. 
 You know, he never told 
 me what happened that day. 
 We were newlyweds, and he calls 
 me from the hospital saying 
 he was grocery shopping 
 and a guy comes in 
 and just opens fire. 
 And that's all he ever said. 
 He didn't want to talk about 
 it, he didn't want to feel it. 
 But I knew he did, because we 
 were planning on having kids. 
 And then after that day, we weren't. 
 [SOBS] 
 I've tried so many times 
 to talk to him about it, 
 because, how can somewhat live with all 
 that trauma inside of them? 
 I always worried that... 
 it was eating away 
 at him emotionally, you know? 
 I never thought that it could 
 be k*lling him slowly, physically. 
 We're going to make sure 
 that does not happen. 
 Sorry. 
 I know you're busy. 
 - Go. Go, go. 
 - It's OK. I have a few minutes. 
 Thank you. 
 [RADIO CHATTER] 
 Hey. 
 Hot chocolate. Figured you 
 could use some good juju. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 If you wanted something else, 
 you could have just said so. 
 [GROANS] Thought that 
 would make me feel better. 
 OK. Come on. Yell at me. 
 Pretend I'm him or them. 
 All... of them. What do you want to 
 - say? Yell it at me. 
 - No, I'm not... 
 Miranda, he knew your 
 daughter's full name. 
 He knew my daughter's full name. 
 He threatened my child. 
 You... you would hurt 
 a four-year-old girl 
 in the name of life? 
 As if you give two craps 
 about life or about children 
 or about the welfare of 
 any other human other than 
 your own self-righteous... 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 I mean, as if you 
 actually cared about making 
 the world a better place. 
 As if... as if you listen to anything 
 your own religion tells you. 
 But you would hurt a child... 
 My child... for what? 
 Just to prove a point? 
 And then you have the nerve 
 to call yourself pro-life? 
 Well, shame on you. 
 No, you are what is wrong in this world. 
 Not me, not my family, not 
 my child, you sick son of a... 
 No. No. 
 Because my mother used to say, 
 ""k*ll 'em with kindness, Miranda."" 
 [GROANS] I just wish that I could 
 k*ll them with the truth. 
 Maybe there's a way we can do both. 
 He was a huge guy, and I... 
 I should have been scared, 
 but all I could think about 
 - was saving Bailey. 
 - You're so brave. 
 Look at her. 
 She's practically salivating. 
 And over Kwan? Yeesh. 
 - You jealous? 
 - No. 
 Hmm, kind of seems like you are. 
 I'm embarrassed for her. 
 It's not a character flaw 
 to want to be with somebody. 
 Are we still talking about me, 
 or are we talking about you now? 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - [GASPING] 
 [ALARMS BEEPING] 
 We lost his airway. 
 - Code blue! 
 - We'll get him on oxygen. 
 Come on, man. Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. Come on. 
 - Code blue. Code blue. 
 - [HEART MONITOR DRONING] 
 No pulse. 
 We need to intubate him now. Start CPR. 
 All right. Starting 
 cardiac compressions. 
 All right. 
 Code blue. Code blue. 
 There's too much swelling. 
 I can't visualize the cords. 
 - We need to crike him. 
 - We're interns. 
 We have to wait for Dr. Schmitt. 
 Page Dr. Schmitt. Page everyone. 
 I can't do this. I 
 can't watch him die. 
 - We'll be fired! 
 - You can leave if you want to. 
 - I'm saving his life. 
 - Code blue. Code blue. 
 There's a crike tray in the drawer. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 All right, but wait. 
 We should put an IV bag 
 underneath his shoulder blades. 
 I saw Dr. Hunt do it. 
 It'll open up his neck. 
 Code blue. Code blue. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Does anybody see Dr. Schmitt? 
 - OK, let's do it. 
 - Just don't k*ll him. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Thank you, Dr. Shepherd. We'll 
 update you when we're finished. 
 [SIGHS] 
 She's angry that my wife left me. 
 Doesn't seem quite fair. 
 When Amelia is angry, 
 she is rarely fair. 
 Yeah. 
 All right, Griffith. 
 Talk me through this. What's the move? 
 Use the cautery to demarcate the line, 
 and then pass over it 
 with the GIA stapler. 
 Good. 
 - Now show me. 
 - You want me to do it? 
 With all due respect, are you sure? 
 Dr. Pierce always said that... 
 Dr. Pierce doesn't work here 
 anymore, and I think you're ready. 
 ‚ô™ 
 GIA stapler. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Position the stapler, and fire it. 
 [STAPLER CLICKING] 
 - Uh, the edge is bleeding. 
 - OK. How do you stop it? 
 ‚ô™ 
 Ndugu, there are multiple bleeders. 
 Maybe you should take over now. 
 Hunt, kindly back off. 
 Griffith, listen to me. 
 If you stop now, the 
 next time this happens, 
 you'll panic even more. 
 You can do this, all right? 
 I know you can. Just focus. 
 Take a deep breath and think. 
 -  vicryl on a pass, stat. 
 Forceps.

 Come on. 
 Come on. Come on. 
 - Sutures are holding. 
 - Well done. Let's proceed. 
 Is he going to be OK? 
 When something goes wrong, 
 your job is to page me and do 
 nothing until I get there. 
 I paged code blue, 
 but he was dying, so... 
 Is he OK? 
 I need to be sure that you 
 understand that if he doesn't 
 make it, your career is over. 
 All that training for nothing. 
 All you had to do was wait two minutes. 
 He didn't have two minutes. 
 If Adams hadn't stepped 
 in he would be in a coma 
 right now or worse. 
 It's tough enough to pay back 
 student loans when you are a doctor. 
 When they pull your 
 license because you sliced 
 a patient's neck with no 
 one there to supervise you, 
 it's way harder. 
 You did the crike well. 
 You saved his life. 
 - I'm admitting him to the ICU. 
 - Oh, thank god. 
 Oh my god. 
 That fear you're feeling? 
 Remember it next time and wait. 
 [EXHALES] 
 Um, thanks for sticking up for me. 
 Well, we couldn't let him 
 die without declaring his love 
 for a fictional character. 
 What's your deal? 
 Are you really just, like, anti-love? 
 I went to med school in Colorado. 
 I had a crush on a guy in O-chem, 
 and that's where he was going. 
 My mom encouraged me, 
 because according to her 
 love is not only everything, 
 it is the only thing. 
 And first semester, I 
 failed gross anatomy, 
 because I was at his birthday party 
 instead of studying for my final... 
 His birthday party 
 where he called me Jane 
 and then made out with my best friend 
 at the end of the night. 
 My grades recovered, but surgical 
 internships are so competitive. 
 That's why I'm in the program 
 for rejects and losers. 
 Because my parents taught me to value 
 an obsessive crush over my grades 
 and my medical school aspirations. 
 Have you ever thought that maybe there's 
 a difference between a 
 stupid, obsessive crush 
 and actual love? 
 You sound exactly like my mother. 
 [GROANS] 
 Oh, hey. 
 You will not believe what I 
 have been dealing with today. 
 You OK? 
 [SCOFFS] We removed, 
 uh... [CLEARS THROAT] 
 b*llet fragments from a 
 mass sh**ting survivor today. 
 And while we were in the OR, 
 there were two more sh**t. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I... I don't recognize 
 our country anymore. 
 Weapons of w*r in grocery stores, 
 at parades and schools, active 
 sh**t drills in third grade. 
 We used to be horrified, you know? 
 We used to grieve as a nation. 
 But now... now it happens so frequently, 
 we don't even blink. 
 And nothing changes. 
 [SCOFFS] And I feel hopeless. 
 - [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 - Hey. 
 So I have an idea. 
 You're either going 
 to love it or hate it. 
 Dr. Shepherd, I just want 
 to reiterate how sorry I am. 
 You lost focus while I had 
 my hands inside a man's back. 
 He is the one that you 
 should be apologizing to. 
 He is the one who trusted 
 you while he was unconscious 
 on an operating table. 
 You don't let yourself 
 get distracted when 
 people are depending on you. 
 When they are vulnerable and scared, 
 that is when you give them 
 everything that you've got. 
 That is when you stay 
 alert long enough not 
 to drop a sharp metal object 
 while someone's spine is exposed. 
 I... I didn't drop it in him... 
 I'm sorry, you're defending yourself? 
 What is wrong with you? 
 I'm really asking. Yasuda, 
 what is wrong with you? 
 - Do I really need to answer that? 
 - No, you don't, Yasuda. 
 You can go. You, come with me. 
 - Addie? 
 - Richard. Uh, yeah. 
 I'll find you later, OK? 
 Are you high? 
 - No. 
 - Is that the truth? 
 No, I'm not high. 
 - Are you using again? 
 - No. I can't sleep, I... I can't eat. 
 - I am a wreck. I am not using. God. 
 - OK, great. 
 Then I'm going to go ahead 
 and love you enough to tell you 
 to pull your head out 
 of your self-obsessed ass 
 and get to an AA meeting, 
 because the world is already on fire. 
 We don't need you burning 
 anything else down, all right? 
 And I know you're in 
 pain, and I know that you 
 feel it more than most. 
 But... get to a meeting, 
 say a damn prayer, 
 call your sponsor, then eat 
 something and figure out a way 
 to be of service 
 to this... broken world, 
 instead of adding to everyone's pain. 
 Because it starts with you 
 trashing everybody else, 
 and it ends with you back in 
 rehab again, if you're lucky. 
 No one has abandoned you, Amelia, OK? 
 Everyone is just doing 
 the best that they can. 
 I love you, and everyone 
 else is just barely surviving, 
 and it has nothing to do with you. 
 I love you, and you 
 need to make the decision 
 to stop the spiral. 
 And if you can't do it, 
 you need to find someone, 
 get someone to help you stop it. 
 I love you, Amelia. 
 And... you've got to 
 get off the damn ride 
 before it's too late. 
 I know that we've all been 
 worried about Dr. Bailey. 
 What she is going through 
 is frightening and invasive, 
 and how it's not against 
 the law is beyond me. 
 What I do know is that it 
 is easier to hurt a stranger 
 than someone you know. 
 Dr. Kwan is handing out 
 lists of Dr. Bailey's 
 most frequent callers. 
 If you're wondering what 
 you can do, call them. 
 Talk to them. 
 Be respectful, be kind. 
 Be familiar. 
 And maybe they will 
 think twice about picking 
 up that phone again. 
 ‚ô™ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ‚ô™ 
 Dr. Bailey would like you to know 
 she's praying for you too. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 ‚ô™ Talks about revolution ‚ô™ 
 But even though she disagrees with you, 
 Dr. Bailey respects your beliefs. 
 I'm a better surgeon because 
 Dr. Bailey is my teacher. 
 Well, you know, when I 
 see Dr. Bailey in the ER, 
 I feel better, because I know 
 my patient is in good hands. 
 And, Linda, the clinic she founded 
 is for so much more than abortion. 
 We deliver babies there. 
 I'm sorry it freaks you out, but how 
 - do you think Dr. Bailey feels? 
 - Your prayers have been received. 
 And we are praying for you as well. 
 Dr. Bailey loves her family 
 and wants to keep them safe, 
 which I'm sure you can understand. 
 Above all else, Dr. Bailey 
 is an incredible person, 
 and I am privileged 
 to call her my friend. 
 This is Dr. Winston Ndugu 
 calling from Grey Sloan. 
 Colleague of Dr. Miranda Bailey's. 
 I understand you were 
 trying to get ahold of her. 
 We wish you and your family well. 
 All right. Take care. 
 ‚ô™ Watching the world 
 wake up from history ‚ô™ 
 How are you feeling? 
 Better. 
 A little bit better. 
 [SIRENS WAILING] 
 Can I help you? 
 I... I'm looking for, um... 
 This is going to sound so weird. 
 I don't know his name. 
 Would you happen to be Princess Astrid? 
 He talked about me? 
 He's sedated right now. 
 But when he wakes up, I'm sure he'll be 
 very happy to see you.

 - We got every last piece.

 ‚ô™ Didn't feel much of a choice ‚ô™ 
 Russell, you OK? 
 I didn't realize how much I hated 
 having those b*ll*ts inside of me. 
 And now they're gone. 
 ‚ô™ 
 They're finally gone.

 - What happened? 
 She's OK. Luna's OK. 
 She's... she's healthy,

 - Yeah. 
 And the technology's come a long way, 
 and we can learn sign language. 
 And you did learn sign language, 
 because you're so wonderful. 
 And I... I was an ass, and I'm so sorry. 
 - [GRUNTS] 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 I did a stapled lung resection today. 
 Whoa, are you serious? 
 It was terrifying and 
 also the coolest thing I've 
 ever done in my entire life. 
 OK, I hate you right now. 
 - But congratulations. 
 - Thanks. 
 I, um, did an emergency crike today. 
 It was pretty badass. 
 - What? 
 - Yeah. 
 Why didn't you open with 
 that? Did you get in trouble? 
 - [PHONE BUZZES] 
 - That's Trey. 
 I got to call him, but 
 don't forget anything. 
 I want a full play-by-play 
 when I get home. 
 I need you to be Simone's maid of honor. 
 No, thank you. 
 I'll do all your scut until the wedding. 
 - Even my disimpactions? 
 - Yes. 
 You must really love her. 
 You sound just like your mom. 
 Hey. 
 I haven't been to this 
 bar, so if it's bad...

 it's hard to remember

 [KNOCK AT DOOR] 
 - Come in. 
 - Hey, do you have a minute? 
 - One. I'm about to run out the door. 
 - OK, I'll be quick. 
 I just wanted to make sure I'm 
 being considered for chief of cardio. 
 I have a sterling record, 
 and I'm committed to teaching. 
 I think I'd be good at it. I want it. 
 - I'll take it into consideration. 
 - All right. Thank you. 
 Yeah. 
 Helm. What are you doing here? 
 When I burned out, 
 nobody stood up for me. 
 So I'm standing up for Yasuda. 
 Because if she can't afford 
 to pay her student loans 
 and also eat and live while she's 
 learning how to save 
 lives, there is something 
 wrong with the system. 
 And I know... I know it's 
 been broken for a long time, 
 but that is not a reason not to fix it. 
 And you're chief of surgery. 
 So hey, congratulations, it is your job 
 to figure out how to 
 support your interns instead 
 of using and abusing 
 them and then throwing 
 them out with the trash. 
 ‚ô™ Please please ‚ô™ 
 MEREDITH: And it's even 
 harder to figure out 
 who you are after. 
 Well, so far, so good. 
 I mean, Chicago is freezing. 
 It is no joke. But, um, 
 the lab is incredible. 
 Well, that's good. 
 Are you making friends? 
 Yeah, everybody's been 
 pretty nice so far. 
 And is your apartment good? 
 Oh, I have floor-to-ceiling 
 windows with a lake view. 
 Honestly, I think everybody complains 
 about the weather to keep 
 the real estate a secret. 
 [CHUCKLES] Uh, Maggie, I got to go. 
 It looks like your sister 
 might need a friend. 
 - Thank you for looking out for her. 
 - Yeah. 
 Dr. Shepherd? 
 ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ You keep holding on ‚ô™ 
 I am also in an alcoholic, 
 self-obsessive spiral 
 about abandonment, and I 
 could really use a meeting. 
 ‚ô™ Let me exhale ‚ô™ 
 [EXHALES] 
 MEREDITH: But if you 
 look for your people 
 and hold them close... 
 I still can't believe you 
 drove all the way out here 
 for one day when you could 
 have had everything you 
 needed shipped right to you. 
 ‚ô™ 
 Were you doing a wellness check on me? 
 What, do you think I 
 could stay away when 
 you're going through hell? 
 No way. We're in this together. 
 ‚ô™ You exhale ‚ô™ 
 ‚ô™ You exhale ‚ô™ 
 ""This should keep you in business 
 for a while. Keep fighting. Yang."" 
 ‚ô™ 
 All right. Let's load her up, then.

house_1_5,412142,1,5,"We are condemned to useless labor. 
 Fourth circle of hell. 
 Charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate all classic poetry. 
 Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. 
 I'm pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless. 
 You're over two weeks behind in your charting. 
 Oops. 
 I missed. 
 - What are you, eight? 
 - Could an eight-year-old do this? 
 You'd better stop, or it'll stick that way.

 She's been waiting for you since 11:00. 
 Melancholy without hope. 
 Which circle is that? 
 Hi. 
 I'm Dr. House. 
 What seems to be the problem? 
 Show him your hands, Augustine. 
 - It-It looks like stigmata. 
 - Shh. 
 Pius. 
 You must be all the talk around the ""holy water"" cooler. 
 Been washing a lot of dishes recently? 
 I help out in the kitchen. 
 - Anything new in the kitchen? 
 - We just got a donation of saucepans and pots this week. 
 - I unpacked and washed them. 
 - Should have spent your time saving souls. 
 It's easier on the hands. 
 This is contact dermatitis. 
 You're allergic to dish soap. 
 Nonsense. 
 We've always used that soap. 
 Why is there a problem now? 
 I've been a doctor for years. 
 Why do I have to keep assuring people that I know what I'm doing? 
 Aperson can become allergic to substances... 
 that they've had repeated and prolonged exposure to. 
 The good news is-- free samples. 
 Diphenhydramine. 
 It's an antihistamine. 
 It'll stop the allergic reaction. 
 Take one every eight hours. 
 It might make you feel a little sleepy. 
 And get some of that over-the-counter cortisone cream. 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 You want some water? 
 I have some tea. 
 Well, you just relax for a few minutes. 
 That stuff works pretty fast. 
 Still out by 12:00. 
 How do you solve a problem like dermatitis? 
 What? 
 Doctor? 
 I want to thank you for your patience. 
 She talkin' to you? 
 I don't know. 
 She's certainly looking at me. 
 Ah, it's good to get a secular diagnosis. 
 The sisters tend to interpret their illnesses as divine intervention. 
 And you don't? 
 Then you're wearing an awfully funny hat. 
 Ooh, boy. 
 Excuse me. 
 If I break my leg, I believe it happened for a reason. 
 I believe God wanted me to break my leg. 
 I also believe he wants me to put a cast on it. 
 Doctor! 
 Something's wrong. 
 Lift up your chin. 
 Sister, you're having an asthma attack. 
 I need you to relax. 
 Roll up her sleeve, please. 
 I'm gonna give you epinephrine. 
 It'll open your lungs and help you breathe. 
 What happened? 
 Did she take the pill? 
 - Yes. 
 - It's probably an allergic reaction. 
 She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine? 
 You figure somebody's out to get her? 
 - How are you feeling? 
 - Better. 
 I'll put you on some steroids instead. 
 - Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny? 
 - It's called adrenaline. 
 It makes your heart beat fast. 
 But not this fast. 
 Get a nurse, please. 
 Hold on. 
 Help! 
 Somebody help us! 
 Somebody get in here! 
 Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. 
 She's got no pulse. 
 You diagnosed the patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine. 
 She went into respiratory distress,  and you injected her with epinephrine. 
 Presumably 1 c.c. 
 .1 c.c. 
 That is the standard dose. 
 That is what I gave her. 
 People don't go into cardiac arrest from .1 c.c. epinephrine. 
 She must have a preexisting heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine. 
 It's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart. 
 I can make it up right now. 
 The drawer has syringes with both dosages. 
 You could have reached for the wrong--  - But I didn't. 
 - Everyone makes mistakes. 
 This is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance. 
 Relax. 
 They're not gonna sue. 
 The worst they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler. 
 - And the discipline board-- are they gonna whack your hand too? 
 - You're gonna report me? 
 - What choice do I have? 
 - Uh, how about not report me? 
 I can justify keeping her here for a 24-hour observation. 
 If you haven't found an underlying cause for the cardiac arrest by then,  I will have to notify our attorneys. 
 Her hands were red and swollen. 
 Maybe she has a skin infection. 
 Cellulitis? 
 That could manifest with tachycardia. 
 There's no history of fever. 
 Results from the C.B.C. didn't indicate an infection. 
 The eosinophils are mildly elevated. 
 Sed rate's up a bit. 
 Could we be looking at a systemic allergic response? 
 It's not allergic. 
 Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. 
 - Could be inflammation of the blood vessels. 
 - Vasculitis? 
 That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count. 
 Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. 
 The blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed,  causing the asthma, rash and heart problems-- covers all her symptoms. 
 You need a biopsy to diagnose. 
 Chest C.T. would be quicker. 
 The lady just came in with a rash. 
 What the hell are those? 
 Candy canes. 
 Candy canes? 
 Are you mocking me? 
 No. 
 It-It's Christmas, and I--  I thought-- Relax. 
 It's a joke. 
 Isn't the prognosis for Churg-Strauss a bit grim? 
 Yeah. 
 Untreated, only 33% of patients survive past a year. 
 Treated-- five years. 
 Then I definitely suggest treatment. 
 If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say that he made a mistake... 
 and gave her too much epinephrine. 
 Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake... 
 is saying it was my mistake. 
 Everyone screws up. 
 Your rule. 
 I think you fit within the subset of ""everyone"". 
 I didn't screw up. 
 - Order a chest C.T. and start the sister on prednisone-- 40 milligrams T.I.D. 
 - The sister? 
 Oh, didn't I mention? 
 The patient's a nun-- Sister Augustine. 
 I hate nuns. 
 Who doesn't? 
 - Sister Augustine? 
 - We weren't watching. 
 We were trying to see if this is the bed control. 
 Oh. 
 Uh, this one's the bed control. 
 And that's the TV control. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Cameron. 
 This is Dr. 
 Chase and Dr. 
 Foreman. 
 I haven't seen television in over 20 years. 
 Do you consider it the work of the devil,  or do you just not get cable where you live? 
 - Um-- - How are you feeling, Sister? 
 I seem to be a little better. 
 They gave me some medication. 
 Prednisone. 
 It's a steroid to help with the inflammation. 
 Has Dr. 
 House figured out what I have? 
 Will I be okay? 
 We're not sure what's wrong yet. 
 You'll have a chest C.T. 
 scan this afternoon that'll help with the diagnosis. 
 Dr. House is giving her medication, and he doesn't know what she has yet? 
 Trust, Sister Pius. 
 It all happens for a reason. 
 He doesn't know what he's doing. 
 The only problem that woman has is that House grabbed the wrong syringe. 
 You don't trust him? 
 I don't trust a man who won't admit he might be wrong. 
 I notice you weren't so quick to tell her she's got Churg-Strauss and only has a couple years left. 
 I don't tell patients bad news unless it's conclusive. 
 Because you know he might be wrong. 
 About Churg-Strauss. 
 Not about what happened in the clinic. 
 What about you, Chase? 
 You think he's infallible too? 
 All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss,  he'll be self-satisfied and our lives will be good for a few weeks. 
 If House did make a mistake, he'll be upset and our lives will be miserable for months. 
 There is that. 
 If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake, the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty. 
 She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent. 
 Oh, here we go-- lesson time. 
 I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. 
 I also recognize that I am human and capable of error. 
 So you might have screwed this up? 
 No. 
 So it's merely a theoretical capacity for error. 
 Good point. 
 Maybe there isn't one. 
 Maybe that's my error. 
 Most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves. 
 Most people don't like to listen. 
 So, what's wrong with you? 
 Let me guess-- inflammatory bowel. 
 Wow. 
 Yeah. 
 Is it that bad? 
 Yes. 
 It's also written on your chart. 
 ""Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain. 
 Took sulfasalazine, but it didn't work"". 
 - No. 
 Then-Then I-- - ""Next, tried steroid enemas. 
 Oral corticosteroids--5-A.S.A., 6-mercaptopurine"". 
 - I'm impressed. 
 - By my medical history? 
 By how well your last doctor charted. 
 It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom every hour,  but when the kids sit on my lap, it's--  The store sent me home. 
 They're gonna fire me. 
 Can't you put me back on 5-A.S.A.? 
 Maybe it'll work this time. 
 Not likely. 
 I'm giving you a prescription. 
 It's cheap, which is good,  because your insurance company won't pay for it. 
 - ""Cogaritis""? 
 - Cigarettes. 
 One twice a day. 
 No more, no less. 
 Studies have shown that cigarette smoking...  is one of the most effective ways to control inflammatory bowel. 
 Plus it's been well established that you look 30% cooler. 
 - Are you kidding me? 
 - About the looking cooler, yeah. 
 - The rest is true. 
 - Isn't it addictive and dangerous? 
 Pretty much all the dr*gs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. 
 The only difference with this one is it's completely legal. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 I was talking to the nurse-- Arsenio. 
 Do you know him? 
 Not really. 
 He can take pictures with his phone. 
 Cool. 
 That woman from the lab was interesting too. 
 She studied astrophysics before becoming a nurse. 
 You know the staff better than I do. 
 I love to hear all about people. 
 - Yet you live in a monastery. 
 - It's where I serve our Lord and the world best. 
 Our Lord maybe. 
 The rest of the world, on the other hand,  - would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or-- - Healing the sick? 
 As an example, yeah. 
 Did you always want to be a doctor? 
 Always. 
 You always want to be a nun? 
 My parents died when I was six. 
 I was raised in a foster home run by the Church. 
 When I was 18, I went to the monastery, where they let me take my vows. 
 I've known no other life, and I haven't wanted to. 
 Okay, Sister. 
 We need you to lie as still as possible. 
 If you get scared, just let us know. 
 As Jonah said from inside the whale,  ""When I had lost all hope, I turned my thoughts to the Lord.""  - Well, she's got God on her side. 
 - I don't believe in God. 
 You're not even a little agnostic? 
 Is it supposed to smell funny? 
 Someone ralphed in there this morning. 
 We cleaned it up, but--  - It's normal, Sister. 
 It's just a few more minutes. 
 - Mm. 
 I believe in a higher order that's in control of what happens,  but not one, anthropomorphic entity called ""God""... 
 that's concerned with the everyday workings of you and me. 
 What else is there to control but the everyday workings of you and me? 
 It's always about you, Foreman. 
 What are you talking about-- the trees, the fish? 
 Should they be the ones that think it's all about them? 
 What about you, Chase? 
 Do you believe in God? 
 I believe Sister Augustine has no vascular pathology, which means no Churg-Strauss. 
 Which means House made a mistake. 
 No, not necessarily. 
 It could be something else-- thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid. 
 I don't get you. 
 You don't believe in God, but you're willing to put complete faith in one man? 
 Please. 
 The smell. 
 Let's get her out of there. 
 I'm coming, Sister. 
 I gotcha. 
 Please. 
 The smell. 
 I'm comin'. 
 I'm gonna be sick. 
 There's no smell. 
 No. 
 God. 
 Oh! 
 It's Jesus. 
 It's Jesus! 
 He's coming for me! 
 He's burning me with his touch! 
 Let's get her on some Ativan. 
 The smells, religious visions-- it's symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling. 
 - We don't want her to-- - She's seizing. 
 - Jaw block! 
 - Help me get her on her side. 
 - Religious visions? 
 - Yeah. 
 And next comes--  Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis. 
 - What's that tell us? 
 - Her immune system is severely compromised. 
 Oh, I know. 
 Prednisone compromises the immune system. 
 - Isn't that the medicine that you gave her for that thing she doesn't have? 
 - Yeah, that-- Hey. 
 - I'm thinking that's a trick question. 
 - Her immune system is severely compromised. 
 - Two doses of prednisone wouldn't do that. 
 - Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb? 
 - In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic. 
 - You're gonna admit negligence? 
 Unless you leave the room. 
 If you stay, you'll have to testify. 
 Five, four,  three, two--  So, there I was in the clinic, drunk. 
 I opened the drawer, closed my eyes,  take the first syringe I can find --  So, what are the options for a compromised immune system? 
 Mixed connective tissue disease. 
 It'd explain why she was feeling better on the prednisone. 
 Sure. 
 She was feeling better right up to the moment it almost k*lled her. 
 On the other hand, it explains the symptoms--  swollen hands, pulmonary problems, cardiac problems. 
 It all fits. 
 Except her A.N.A. 
 was normal. 
 - So redraw the blood. 
 - But the treatment is corticosteroids--  prednisone-- and we can't go there because of the encephalitis. 
 Then we'll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn't suppress it--  hyperbaric oxygen chamber. 
 There's no protocol for putting a patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat auto-immune problems. 
 Oh, you people. 
 Always with the protocols. 
 Prep the nun and discontinue the prednisone. 
 I am both amused and annoyed... 
 that you think I should be less stubborn than you are. 
 You are aware of the Hippocratic oath, right? 
 The one that starts, ""First, do no harm"", then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions,  and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone? 
 Yeah. 
 I took a read once. 
 Wasn't impressed. 
 Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity-- lung and eye damage. 
 Every treatment has its dangers. 
 Which is why we only treat... 
 if we're convinced the patient actually needs the treatment. 
 I'm convinced. 
 You're not. 
 Question is, what are you gonna do about it? 
 Hmm? 
 I have an opening Thursday at 3:00. 
 Do you have a fourth? 
 Is he any good? 
 Can I call you right back? 
 Okay. 
 What's up? 
 The pressure will force the oxygen into your system, saturate your blood. 
 It will enhance white cell activity, reduce the inflammation. 
 And that will help with this mixed connective tissue disease? 
 We'll be doing about 10 treatments, and then we'll reevaluate. 
 The last treatment with prednisone caused the seizures, right? 
 How confident is Dr. 
 House about this? 
 That you reacted so strongly to the prednisone let us know... 
 that you had an underlying problem with your immune system. 
 I guess it was a blessing... of sorts. 
 So, who's your favorite reindeer, Nurse Arnold? 
 Rudolph. 
 I would've thought it was Vixen. 
 What are you implying? 
 Nothing. 
 But I saw you at the Christmas party with Dr. 
 Riles...  and Dr. Jorkins and Nurse Crandall. 
 I was just doing some Christmas dancing. 
 This is a chapel, a house of prayer. 
 House of prayer? 
 Huh. 
 That explains the good reception. 
 Also why nobody's ever here. 
 I need to talk with you, Dr. 
 House. 
 Sister Augustine believes in things that aren't real. 
 I thought that was a job requirement for you people. 
 She's been known to lie to get sympathy. 
 She's a hypochondriac. 
 So you're warning me that I may be treating a nonexistent ailment. 
 Sore throats, joint pains. 
 There's always something wrong, and there's never a reason for it. 
 Mother Superior plays right into it--  lets Augustine off work duties,  treating her as fragile, special. 
 That must make you angry. 
 It bothers me. 
 It's not really in Augustine's best interests. 
 You want some? 
 I shouldn't. 
 I guess you gotta be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh? 
 Mm. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So, we've got pride, anger, envy, gluttony--  That's four out of seven deadly sins in under two minutes. 
 Do you people keep records of these things? 
 Is there a ""Cathlympics""? 
 They say you have a gift. 
 They like to talk. 
 - You hide behind your intelligence. 
 - Yeah. 
 That's pretty stupid. 
 And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. 
 Because if you take things seriously, they matter. 
 And if they matter-- When things go wrong, I get hurt. 
 - I'm not tough. 
 I'm vulnerable. 
 - I barely know you. 
 And I don't know if I'm right. 
 I just hope I am. 
 Because the alternative is... 
 you really are as miserable as you seem to be. 
 You know, from the way you're looking at me right now,  I'd say you just hit number five. 
 Lust. 
 Dr. 
 Brown, I love you too. 
 How are you feeling? 
 A little weak. 
 - That's from the oxygen. 
 - My mouth is dry. 
 Okay. 
 Well, uh, I'll get you some of your tea. 
 Mixed connective tissue disease? 
 Her A.N.A. is barely elevated. 
 Thanks for checking up on her. 
 Good to know you got my back. 
 O2 sat's down to 83. 
 Pulmonary problems, breathing problems. 
 Irritation from the oxygen is typical. 
 She comes in with a rash, and you put her into cardiac arrest. 
 That well just never runs dry, does it? 
 If there was no underlying problem, why is she still having the rapid heart rate? 
 Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone. 
 Her reaction is a symptom, not an error. 
 There's always an explanation, isn't there? 
 Yes, there is. 
 And if this one doesn't work, we'll find another. 
 But never one involving you screwing up. 
 One that fits all the facts. 
 Look, we obviously have a difference of opinion, and that's fine. 
 But, unfortunately, I've used up all the time I budgeted today for banging my head against a wall. 
 I'm gonna do you the biggest favor one doctor can do for another. 
 I am gonna stop you from k*lling your patient. 
 You're off the case. 
 We're gonna treat the symptoms. 
 Not the underlying condition? 
 There is no underlying condition. 
 What's her status? 
 The sister's breathing is labored. 
 Pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber. 
 Put her on 40% oxygen until her O2 sats increase. 
 B.U.N. and creatinine's rising. 
 A.L.T. and A.S.T. twice the normal range. 
 Could be from the hypotensive episode. 
 Let's follow them with labs. 
 She still has the rash and joint pain she came in with. 
 Order a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory. 
 When we were looking at the differential diagnosis with Dr. 
 House,  we were considering-- I don't need to hear what Dr. 
 House was considering. 
 All of this woman's symptoms can be traced to Dr. 
 House's considerations. 
 Okay. 
 Let's just get this patient healthy. 
 I want her going out the front door and not the back. 
 Hey, it's not like I betrayed him. 
 Cuddy would have found out about the hyperbaric treatments eventually. 
 You did what you thought you had to. 
 Can't get enough of this place, huh? 
 Came for my stethoscope. 
 So I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it... 
 in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it? 
 Okay. 
 Yeah, I'd like to clear my reputation. 
 Oh, right. 
 I forgot how much you care about what people think. 
 Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? 
 That's, uh-- They cause lung cancer, you know. 
 You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer,  colorectal cancer, prostate cancer-- and not for lung cancer? 
 They ran out of colors? 
 It's because people blame lung cancer patients. 
 They smoke. 
 They screwed up. 
 They deserve to die. 
 The reason people die from lung cancer is guilt. 
 Huh. 
 Well, guilt does a lot of damage. 
 You said that with great significance. 
 You're not here to find your stethoscope. 
 You're not here to clear your reputation. 
 You're here because you're having doubts. 
 You might have screwed up. 
 I'm here because, if I'm right, Cuddy is k*lling that patient. 
 Okay. 
 But if you're wrong? 
 Then she's saving her. 
 Fine. 
 You're gonna have to go through every record of every patient... 
 who's been through this clinic in the last two days. 
 And you're gonna have to hope that those records can be trusted. 
 Which, by the way, yours can't. 
 These pills will help your kidneys function a little better, Sister. 
 Get your wrist? 
 What's that? 
 104. 
 Is that good? 
 It's fine. 
 You're a lousy liar, Dr. 
 Chase. 
 I have to get this. 
 Excuse me. 
 My mother's been dead for 10 years. 
 But she's always with you in spirit. 
 What do you know about the nun? 
 Which one? 
 The cute one. 
 I think she likes me. 
 - The sick one, obviously. 
 - Her parents died when she was a child. 
 She's been with the Church ever since. 
 What's she lying about? 
 - Why do you say that? 
 - I always say that. 
 And the old nun thinks the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. 
 You know nuns. 
 What do you think? 
 I don't know nuns. 
 You hate nuns. 
 You can't hate someone if you don't know them. 
 Know any Nazis? 
 Maybe I hate them on principle. 
 I have a theory about what makes good boys good. 
 It's not because of some moral imperative. 
 Good boys have the fear of God put into them. 
 Catholic Church specializes in that kind of training--  to make good boys afraid of divine retribution,  so they'll do what their daddies tell them--  like, for example, going into medical school when it's the last thing they wanna do. 
 What do you think? 
 I think, if she did have a secret, her boss would know. 
 Did you paint or put in new carpets recently? 
 No. 
 Any way she could have got access to dr*gs? 
 We lock all our medications in the infirmary, and we don't keep prescription dr*gs here. 
 Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly? 
 I've found that when you want to know the truth about someone,  that someone is probably the last person you should ask. 
 Ah. 
 And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist? 
 She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. 
 Oh. 
 If I were you, I'd have her repeat a year of nun school. 
 Well, becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint. 
 Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer. 
 And just because we live in a monastery, and we spend most of our time in prayer,  doesn't mean we don't find time for drama. 
 So, what is the sick one's drama? 
 Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us. 
 - Tea? 
 - Sure. 
 Do all of you lie? 
 It's a good strategy; it's simpler when you all tell the same lie. 
 She has not spent her entire life as a good Catholic. 
 When she had a cardiac arrest, I had to open her blouse to do C.P.R. 
 And I learned two things: nuns can have nice breasts,  and she has a tattoo on her shoulder-- of a skunk. 
 Now, maybe it's the sacred skunk of Joseph,  but, as far as I know, Catholic foster care and monasteries... 
 do not keep tattoo parlors in their refectories. 
 We consider that our life begins... 
 when we put on our habits and take our vows. 
 - What happens before then-- - Is irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me. 
 Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old,  but she left when she was 12. 
 She lived on the streets. 
 She got into dr*gs. 
 When she was 15, she became pregnant. 
 Tried to self-abort. 
 She lost the child. 
 She became ill. 
 We took her in when she came back. 
 If we had thought it was medically relevant, we would have told you. 
 It's not. 
 This tea is delicious. 
 Local herbs? 
 Any change with the medication? 
 Yes. 
 She's getting worse. 
 Lung function's deteriorating. 
 B.U.N. and creatinine continuing to rise. 
 She's starting to run a fever, and the rash is spreading. 
 At this rate, she's not gonna make Christmas. 
 Maybe House is right. 
 Maybe there is an underlying condition that explains the symptoms. 
 Something we haven't considered. 
 Like what? 
 It could be a metabolic disorder. 
 Specifically? 
 Might be genetic. 
 Specifically? 
 I'm just saying-- You're just saying you think House is right. 
 Might be right. 
 Ofcourse he might be right. 
 It might be the hand of God at work. 
 Don't say it's something else... 
 unless you've got something concrete to offer. 
 What's this, hemlock? 
 I'm gonna do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another. 
 I'm gonna stop you from k*lling your patient. 
 It's figwort tea-- great for that little pick-me-up we're all looking for in the morning. 
 Opens the lungs, increases the blood pressure, stimulates the heart. 
 Unfortunately, if you then get injected with even .1 c.c. of epinephrine--  instant cardiac arrest. 
 - Still, what the hell, it tastes great. 
 - Sister Augustine--  Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak. 
 And if you take the cardiac arrest out of the equation--  All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe long-term allergic reaction. 
 Well, that's what Cameron said in the beginning. 
 Yes, she did. 
 Well done. 
 But your unwillingness to stick by your diagnosis almost k*lled this woman. 
 Take a lesson from Foreman-- stand up for what you believe. 
 Okay. 
 Let's go figure out how to save a nun. 
 Damned if you do, damned if you don't. 
 Because it's been untreated for so long,  it's gone from a simple ""watery eyes, scratchy throat"" allergy... 
 to a whopping ""I'm gonna kick your ass"" allergy--  compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organ systems. 
 So, what's the source? 
 The dish soap. 
 No. 
 The symptoms persisted days after the dish-washing episode. 
 It's gotta be something she's been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery. 
 What about the tea? 
 It caused her arrhythmia. 
 Could be, but it's not definitive. 
 We'll skin-test for allergens. 
 Not yet. 
 She's too reactive. 
 She tests positive to everything. 
 We need to stabilize her--  isolate her from all possible allergens-- give her system a rest. 
 Get her in a clean room. 
 Okay. 
 Then gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. 
 When she reacts to something, we'll know that's what's k*lling her. 
 There you go. 
 No television, no books. 
 - Not even my Bible? 
 - I'm afraid not. 
 This room has filtered air, filtered water. 
 You even have silk sheets-- very decadent and hypoallergenic. 
 You should be feeling better here. 
 We'll be back to check on you in a little while. 
 Can the other sisters come in and pray with me? 
 It'd be better if you don't have any visitors. 
 Once we isolate what's causing your allergy,  then we can be a little more lax. 
 I-I can pray with you. 
 I don't wanna die. 
 Why has he left me? 
 I was in seminary school. 
 They asked us once what our favorite passage was. 
 I chose First Peter, chapter one, verse seven. 
 ""These trials only test your faith to see whether or not it is strong and pure. 
 Your faith is being tested, as fire tests gold and purifies it"". 
 ""And your faith is far more precious to the Lord than mere gold. 
 ""So if your faith remains strong after being tested,  ""it will bring you much praise and glory and honor... 
 on the day of his return"". 
 He hasn't left you. 
 The only thing in the way of you knowing he's there is your fear. 
 You have a choice-- faith or fear. 
 That's the test. 
 Choosing faith doesn't mean I won't die. 
 But it will affect how you experience your death... 
 and, therefore, your life. 
 It's up to you. 
 Why did you leave seminary school? 
 That test. 
 You passed. 
 I didn't. 
 We'll call you if anything changes. 
 Will she be all right? 
 As long as she's not exposed to anything that can aggravate her allergy, she'll be fine. 
 I need some help in here! 
 Screw the procedure! 
 She's in anaphylactic shock! 
 No way. 
 She's in a damn clean room. 
 You kidding me? 
 Get in here! 
 . 1 c.c. of epi. 
 We've got to intubate. 
 I got it. 
 Get the ambu bag. 
 I'm in. 
 Breathing's stabilized. 
 It's a clean room. 
 How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room? 
 Maybe it was the preservatives in the I.V.? 
 Checked that. 
 Latex tubing? 
 Checked that. 
 Checked everything. 
 Well, it could be mast cell leukemia. 
 It can cause anaphylaxis. 
 I checked the blood levels, and it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylaxis. 
 Maybe it's just divine will. 
 It's not my will. 
 You do realize, if you're wrong-- about the big picture, that is--  you're going to burn, right? 
 What do you want me to do-- just accept it, pack it in? 
 Yeah. 
 I want you to accept that sometimes patients die against all reason,  and sometimes they get better against all reason. 
 No, they don't. 
 We just don't know the reason. 
 I think the nuns would agree with you on that. 
 I just wanted to say that I know that you did everything you could. 
 I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well. 
 That's your problem, not mine. 
 I was just being nice. 
 Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that. 
 Merry Christmas. 
 Sister Augustine's been extubated. 
 Good. 
 She's requested to check out, against medical advice. 
 She wants to go back to the monastery. 
 Well, talk her out of it. 
 I think I may have talked her into it. 
 Room's paid up for the rest of the week. 
 Might as well stick around. 
 This illness... is a test of my faith. 
 If it's his will to take me, it doesn't matter where I am. 
 I can accept that. 
 Does anybody believe anything you say? 
 You're not accepting. 
 You're running away. 
 Just like you always do. 
 You ran away from the monastery to get laid. 
 You ran away from the real world when getting laid didn't work out so good. 
 Now things aren't working out again, so off you go. 
 Why is it so difficult for you to believe in God? 
 What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. 
 Faith isn't based on logic and experience. 
 I experience God on a daily basis... 
 and the miracle of life all around--  the miracle of birth, the miracle of love. 
 He is always with me. 
 Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby? 
 Hmm? 
 Then watching her mother abandon her 'cause she needs another score. 
 Miracle of love. 
 You're over twice as likely to be k*lled... 
 by the person you love than by a stranger. 
 Are you trying to talk me out of my faith? 
 You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife... 
 and heaven and hell. 
 But when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot. 
 'Cause you can tell me that you put your faith in God to get you through the day,  but when it comes time to cross the road, I know you look both ways. 
 I don't believe he is inside me and is going to save me. 
 I believe he is inside me whether I live or die. 
 Then you might as well live. 
 You got a better shot betting on me than on him. 
 When I was 15,  I was on every kind of birth control known to man--  and I still got pregnant. 
 I blamed God. 
 I hated him for ruining my life. 
 But then I realized something. 
 You can't be angry with God and not believe in him at the same time. 
 No one can. 
 Not even you, Dr. 
 House. 
 How'd it go? 
 She has God inside her. 
 It would have been easier to deal with a tumor. 
 Maybe she's allergic to God? 
 We've looked everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction... 
 except one place-- inside her. 
 On her medical history, she didn't mention any surgery. 
 She had one. 
 Can we get her records? 
 What hospital was it at? 
 She didn't have it at a hospital. 
 Order a full body scan. 
 What if she refuses? 
 Tell her I'm looking for a miracle. 
 No piercings. 
 No fillings. 
 No surgical pins in the arm. 
 No implants. 
 It's clean as a whistle. 
 What's House looking for? 
 - What is that? 
 - Don't know. 
 Lock on it. 
 Get a 3-D representation. 
 Oh, my God. 
 The copper cross-- a form of birth control pulled off the market in the '80s. 
 - So she's allergic to copper. 
 - Rare, but it happens. 
 Wouldn't she know she had an I.U.D.? 
 She had an abortion. 
 I.U.D. must have been left in,  embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn't be detected. 
 So, all we have to do is remove the I.U.D. 
 Then the symptoms should subside. 
 I got this I.U.D. when I was 15. 
 It-It's been more than 20 years. 
 Prolonged exposure to an allergen with minimal symptoms. 
 But at some point. all it takes is one last contact to cause a full-blown reaction. 
 Just like a balloon filled with air-- one last breath, it explodes. 
 The first time I got the rash was when I was washing the copper cookware. 
 And all your subsequent symptoms came from ingesting food prepared in it. 
 Dr. House found his miracle. 
 I doubt he'll interpret it that way. 
 You told me your favorite passage. 
 Would you like to hear mine? 
 ""Celebrate and be glad,  because your brother was dead and is alive again"". 
 The prodigal son. 
 He'll be waiting for you when you're ready. 
 We'll schedule your surgery for tomorrow. 
 The sixth circle of hell. 
 Confined in a sweat box with a bloody nose, and all the tissues are soggy. 
 I think that's the seventh. 
 No. 
 The seventh is--  God, you must be fun at parties. 
 I think we both know the flaw in that theory. 
 How's the sister? 
 Heart rate is normal, kidneys functioning. 
 You know how it is with nuns. 
 You take out their I.U.D.'s, they just bounce right back. 
 Great. 
 Told you I didn't screw up. 
 You screwed up. 
 I gave her .1 c.c. of epinephrine. 
 Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you off the case, you would have k*lled her. 
 You wanna come over for Christmas dinner? 
 You're Jewish. 
 Yeah. 
 Hanukkah dinner. 
 What do you care? 
 It's food. 
 It's people. 
 No, thanks. 
 Maybe I'll come to your place. 
 Your wife doesn't mind being alone at Christmas? 
 I'm a doctor. 
 She's used to being alone. 
 I don't wanna talk about it. 
 Neither do I. 
 You did good with the nun. 
 - Congratulations. 
 - Thank you. 
 Merry Christmas, Dr. 
 House. 
 Dr. Wilson. 
 Good night.

 Foreman: I-I dunno. I just feel kinda weird after what it turned into. 
 Sharon: Well, then it stopped being work. [Foreman smiles] You know, if it‚Äôll solve your ethics problem [plunks a box of‚Ä¶CONDOMS on the bed!] you can reimburse me for these. What are they, five dollars and fifty-seven cents, I believe? [She comes and stands close to him.] You let me know about Friday? 
 Foreman: Mm-hm. [gives her a quick kiss-aww! And she leaves. He puts his tie on, then spots her underwear under the covers. He picks it up, snickers triumphantly and‚Ä¶takes it with him?!] 
 [Cut to Chase, Cameron and House in the office.] 
 Chase: None of the usual suspects! Age isn‚Äôt right, in apparent perfect health before this incident, MRI and PET scan negative for tumors. 
 Cameron: Test him again, it‚Äôs gotta be cancer. [Foreman walks through the door quite suddenly-poof!] 
 Foreman: Sorry I‚Äôm late. Car broke down on the interstate. 
 House: [Checks his watch, then looks back at Foreman skeptically.] Don‚Äôt believe you. [To others] Chem 7 also shows a poor kidney function. Now why would a guy in his twenties have a poor kidney? 
 Cameron: Cancer. It first att*cks the bones, and then the kidneys. 
 House: Come on, people. [Pulls out the baseball card] He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1. 
 Cameron: You want it to be his kidneys, because if it‚Äôs his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it‚Äôs cancer, then he‚Äôll never pitch again. If this were a regular guy who came in and broke his arm lifting a box, you would‚Äôve packed him up and sent him home! 
 House: My God, you‚Äôre right, I lost my head. All life is equally sacred. And I promise you, the next knitting injury that comes in here, we‚Äôre on it like stink on cheese. [Chase smirks] He weighed 175 his rookie year. 
 Cameron: Stop. 
 House: Now he‚Äôs 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why? 
 Cameron: He let himself go. 
 Foreman: Steroids! I mean, the guy was a drug user, I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt have balked at pumping up through chemicals. 
 Chase: That‚Äôd explain the weight gain. And the kidney problems. 
 House: And the bone loss. Go ask him what he‚Äôs on. When he says nothing, have him pee in a cup. [Chase leaves, and House turns his attention to Foreman.] If your car breaks down, you‚Äôre an hour late, not two minutes. And two minutes isn‚Äôt late enough to use a clever excuse like car trouble. 
 Foreman: I was coming in early. 
 House: Huh. Unprompted lies, that‚Äôs a bad sign. Either a guilty conscience or something personal‚Äôs going on. [Foreman sits down with his coffee] See, that‚Äôs all you had to do, Just walk in, sit down, do your job. [Leaves] 
 [Cut to Hank, Chase, and Lola in the room.] 
 Hank: No, no, I never took them. 
 Chase: We‚Äôre gonna need a urine sample. 
 Hank: Oh no, you don‚Äôt trust me. [To Lola] Baby, I‚Äôm worried about taking this morphine. 
 Lola: You‚Äôre in pain, the doses are monitored. It‚Äôs not a slip. Besides, opiates weren‚Äôt your thing. 
 Hank: They should‚Äôve been. Woah‚Ä¶ 
 Chase: Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample. 
 Hank: I wanna say no, so I am. No. 
 Lola: Trust is a big issue in early recovery. He really did gain the weight honestly. 
 Chase: If you say so. [Moves to the other side of the room] 
 Hank: You‚Äôre not getting it. [Chase sits down] [To Lola] He thinks I‚Äôm an idiot. 
 Chase: He sure does. [Smiles, and points to the catheter bag that is collecting urine from Hank.] 
 [Cut to Cameron and Foreman in the lab.] 
 Cameron: Should we save the sample? Dr. Sportsfan can put it in Lucite and hang it around his neck. [smirks] 
 Foreman: Hey, Friday night? Can you cover for me? 
 Cameron: I think so. [Foreman grins triumphantly] Oh, Friday. No, I‚Äôm sorry, I have to go to that oncology thing-that seminar. 
 Foreman: Oh. 
 Cameron: What‚Äôs going on? 
 Foreman: Dinner with the‚Ä¶drug rep. Casting pharmaceuticals. 
 Cameron: Arnie? Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes, only tells one? 
 Foreman: Uh‚Ä¶new guy. 
 [Cut to House leaving his office on the cell phone‚Ä¶again.] 
 House: You need cash?‚Ä¶Ah, no, I, I don‚Äôt have that much on me‚Ä¶No no, it‚Äôs not a problem. No, I‚Äôll be over by 6. ‚ÄòKay. *Click* [To receptionist] 5 p.m., Dr. House checks out. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs 4:45. 
 House: I was rounding up. 
 Cuddy: Carol Moffett, please see Dr. House in Exam Room 1. [Woman gets to her feet with difficulty.] 
 House: Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy. 
 Carol: It‚Äôs Carol. [House comes over] 
 House: Ah. [checks watch] Uh, trouble with the leg? [Carol nods, House spots a bridal magazine in her purse] When‚Äôs the wedding? 
 Carol: This Saturday. 
 House: Not much time to fit into that pretty dress, and no time for practical shoe-shopping. You‚Äôre running two miles a day further than you should be. 
 Carol: [rubs her calf] It hurts right here- 
 House: New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the afternoon Cokes, you‚Äôre gonna look beautiful. [Looks at the next guy] What‚Äôs wrong with you? 
 Man: I can‚Äôt get my contact lenses out- 
 House: [leans close] Out of what? They‚Äôre not in your eyes. 
 Man: But they‚Äôre red. 
 House: That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre trying to remove your corneas. [walks over to next man] What‚Äôs wrong with you? 
 Dentist: Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that- 
 House: Yeah, yeah. Symptoms, [gestures at Cuddy] we‚Äôre working on a personal best here. 
 Dentist: Numbness in my feet and hands, constipation- [Cuddy comes over to House] 
 House: And? 
 Cuddy: Maybe he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about his private matters- 
 House: Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee! [to dentist] You‚Äôre a dentist. Nitrous oxide poisoning, which means you‚Äôre either dipping into your own supply, or you‚Äôve got a bad valve in the office. Laughing gas rehab‚Äôs probably more expensive than the plumber. Meanwhile, get yourself some B12. [moves to the next victim] Who‚Äôs left? 
 Student: I can‚Äôt see‚Ä¶Nah, I‚Äôm just screwing with you. [House looks pointedly at Cuddy, who smiles] It‚Äôs a hangover, my English Lit prof. told me he‚Äôd fail me next time if I didn‚Äôt show up with a doctor‚Äôs note. 
 House: Well, make friends with the dentist. He can give you a note, and maybe a little nitrous to take the edge off. [he observes the clock, which reads 4:47, and walks through the door.] 
 Cameron: Dr. House! [she and Foreman catch up to House] He tested negative for steroids. 
 Foreman: Elevated beta 2 proteins, though, could be cancerous. Amyloidosis, or lymphoma. 
 House: Or steroids. You guys got any money on you? 
 Cameron: He tested negative for steroids. I, um, I have a couple 20s on me. [reaches into her pocket] 
 House: 50 of them? [Cameron looks shocked] Foreman? 
 Foreman: The FAT PAD biopsy and abdominal CT scan were negative for the cancers, but- 
 House: Well, that just leaves us with steroids! 
 Cameron: He tested negative for steroids. 
 House: Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there‚Äôs one thing they can‚Äôt hide‚Ä¶[checks his watch and walks past Ducklings 1 and 2.] 
 [Cut to Hank‚Äôs room with the Ducklings standing in the back. House walks through the door with a grin.] 
 House: Hi. I‚Äôm Dr. House. [walks over to Hank‚Äôs bed] And this is the coolest day of my life. [With an even bigger grin‚Ä¶he whips the covers off Hank‚Äôs bed!] See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles. [The Ducklings look rather embarrassed] 
 Hank: [pulls the covers back on] I am clean, man, no steroids, no nothing. 
 House: Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn‚Äôt that a great word? Thanks, we don‚Äôt get to say it nearly enough. [To Cameron] Start him on Lupron right away. [Walks out the door.] 
 [Cut to House and Foreman in the hallway.] 
 House: These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them. [Pops a Vicodin. Lola runs after him] 
 Lola: He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids, then you‚Äôre giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse? 
 House: ‚Ä¶No, no, it‚Äôs not. It-it‚Äôs got calcium in it. It‚Äôs very good for the bones. [Lola looks skeptical] Basically, on a molecular level, it‚Äôs just milk. [Lola looks satisfied and walks back to the room. House looks at Foreman.] How long do you figure before I get a call from Cuddy? 
 [Cut to House and Cuddy in her office.] 
 Cuddy: You put him on Lupron. 
 House: Uh-huh. 
 Cuddy: And, you told them it was like milk. 
 House: Yes. 
 Cuddy: Is there any way in which that is not a lie? 
 House: [thinks for a moment] It‚Äôs creamy. But, I had 3 reasons. 
 Cuddy: Good ones? 
 House: Well, we‚Äôll see in a minute, I‚Äôm just making them up now‚Ä¶He lied to me first. 
 Cuddy: Your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. 
 House: If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he‚Äôs cured. Adds up for me- 
 Cuddy: Second reason. 
 House: If I told him the truth, he wouldn‚Äôt have taken the stuff. 
 Cuddy: And if he told you the truth, what would this stuff do to him? 
 House: ‚Ä¶Severe respiratory problems. 
 Cuddy: Third reason. 
 House: I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect. 
 Cuddy: Excellent! [walks over to her desk] You and your lawyer can write a paper. 
 House: Which brings me to my fourth reason. 
 Cuddy: I thought you said there were only three. [sits down] 
 House: I thought you‚Äôd buy one of them. 
 Cuddy: Seriously? 
 House: He‚Äôs not gonna sue. 
 Cuddy: Because his lawyer is a nice guy, who realizes it‚Äôs unfair to blame us for ruining this kid‚Äôs hundred million-dollar career. 
 House: Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory problems, it means he‚Äôs not on steroids, which means there‚Äôs something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad. 
 [Cut to Hank and Ducklings in his room. Hank is gasping for air. Cameron puts an oxygen mask over his face, then Chase gives him an inhaler.] 
 [Cut to Hank, apparently asleep/unconscious. He is now hooked up to a respirator.] 
 [Cut to House and Ducklings 1 and 3 in his office.] 
 House: Osteopenia messing his bones up. Hypogonadism. Impaired liver function, kidney function, and‚Ä¶we have managed to find the only professional athlete in the galaxy who is not on steroids. AND it‚Äôs not cancer. So, what‚Äôs k*lling him? [looks up as Foreman enters‚Ä¶late again.] Who shares my suspicions that the Yankees were somehow involved? 
 Cameron: Shrunken testicles indicate his body‚Äôs not putting out enough testosterone. 
 House: [glances at Foreman and checks his watch] Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll send him a nice note. 
 Foreman: What about something environmental? Arsenic, mercury, the symptoms could indicate- 
 House: Pretty small environment. Wife‚Äôs fine, no one else is sick. 
 Chase: If you throw out the kidneys, everything else adds up. The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function, could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands. 
 House: Addison‚Äôs disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is‚Ä¶ 
 Cameron:[rolls her eyes] Steroids. 
 House: Enough irony for all of us. 
 Foreman: Treatment would cause him to retain fluid. With the kidneys almost shut down already, he‚Äôll die. 
 House: Well, we‚Äôll get him a new kidney. [Cameron looks surprised] 
 Foreman: Your theory is that Addison‚Äôs is causing all the symptoms except for the kidney problems. What‚Äôs causing the kidney problems? 
 House: Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now? 
 Cameron: He tested nega- 
 Chase: Negative for steroids. [grins] 
 House: Agreed. He‚Äôs not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could‚Äôve caused the kidney damage. 
 [Cut to House in Hank‚Äôs room with Lola.] 
 House: You see, kidneys don‚Äôt wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, ‚Äòcuz kidneys can‚Äôt tell time. Steroid damage could take years. 
 Lola: [shakes her head] No steroids. How many times does he have to tell you? 
 House: I don‚Äôt know. How many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league? 
 Hank: That is completely different. 
 House: Oh, that‚Äôs right, I remember. You never did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a lawyer- 
 Lola: If Hank says he never used steroids, that‚Äôs the truth. 
 House: That‚Äôs too bad. Because our theory is that the kidney damage is caused by A, and everything else is caused by B. The beauty of this theory is that we can treat A and B. But if you add the kidney symptoms back into the mix, then we are looking at another letter altogether, one that is apparently not in the alphabet.  Can‚Äôt fix the bones, no more baseball, no more breathing‚Ä¶no more brain function. 
 Lola: Get another explanation. 
 House: Okay. Yeah. Think I‚Äôve got one in my other pants. [starts to leave] 
 Hank: Hold on. [House turns around] Five years ago, Bangor, Maine. My pitching coach had me on something, I never knew what it was. 
 House: And you never tried too hard to find out either. 
 Hank: I gained 12 pounds of muscle in like, 4 weeks. [To Lola, who looks troubled] I‚Äôm sorry, baby. 
 [At this moment, Warner comes rushing in with a colorful balloon bunch, bopping House in the head with one. Talk about bad timing.] 
 Warner: How you doin‚Äô Doc? 
 House: Good. Very good, yeah. 
 [Cut to House and Cuddy in her office‚Ä¶again.] 
 Cuddy: You want me to put Hank Wiggen on the transplant list. 
 House: He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some. 
 Cuddy: Well, they like to save them for people who have-how do I put this- kidney problems. 
 House: He‚Äôs a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions. Do you really want to be known as the hospital that sent him home to die? [Puts a fist down on some papers on her desk] 
 Cuddy: That‚Äôs a great idea, we can be the hospital that k*lled two people. The guy who deserved the kidney, and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren‚Äôt even sure what was wrong with him. 
 House: Everything else is related to the Addison‚Äôs. 
 Cuddy: The test for Addison‚Äôs was inconclusive. 
 House: The test for Addison‚Äôs is always inconclusive. 
 Cuddy: Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you. [tries to take a paper from under House‚Äôs fist; he doesn‚Äôt budge. She gives him an irritated look.] 
 House: You‚Äôre not putting him on the list. [Moves his hand, Cuddy takes paper] 
 Cuddy: Your powers of deduction are breathtaking. 
 House: You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs what I live for. Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day. Ask me something I can say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to. [House leaves] 
 [Cut to Hank. He is still having trouble breathing. Cut to House entering his office; Lola is sitting in his chair.] 
 House: Oh, I‚Äôm sorry Doctor, I didn‚Äôt know you were busy. Want me to come back? 
 Lola: Is he on the list? 
 House: No. [walks over to her] 
 Lola: Then I‚Äôm giving him one of mine. 
 House: ‚Ä¶Okay. 
 Lola: You‚Äôre not gonna tell me it‚Äôs a bad idea? Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it? 
 House: Not my area. That is, however, my chair. 
 Lola: [gets up] When do we do it? [House sits down] 
 House: Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match- 
 Lola: Do you live alone? 
 House: You writing a book? 
 Lola: I made it a question just because it‚Äôs more polite. You got a big ‚ÄúKeep Out‚Äù sign stapled on your forehead. 
 House: That explains it, I told them to put it on my door. 
 Lola: Even if real human contact is something you don‚Äôt have or even want, or need, you should at least be able to see it in other people. 
 House: Yeah. Right. True love. That‚Äôs just how we match organs these days. There‚Äôs a couple in France-high school sweethearts-they‚Äôre trading brains. 
 Lola: We‚Äôre a match. Run your tests. [leaves] 
 [Cut to Chase and Cameron in a bar. The cell phone on the counter buzzes; she picks it up, she and Chase look at it and grin at each other. Foreman comes in and sits down.] 
 Foreman: Hey. The lab call, is she a match? 
 Cameron: Haven‚Äôt heard yet. 
 Chase: You got a text message, though. Friday night-very cryptic. 
 Foreman: Gee‚Ä¶thanks for checking. Can you cover for me? 
 Chase: Oncology seminar. Friday night the same thing as the car trouble? 
 Foreman: I HAD car trouble. 
 Chase: House says you were lying. I believe him. 
 Foreman: ‚Ä¶What‚Äôs that? You got a little wet smudge at the end of your nose! 
 Chase: Hey, I like the guy. He says what he wants, does what he wants. 
 Foreman: He won‚Äôt talk to anyone unless he can jerk them around. 
 Chase: Or needs a thousand bucks. [Foreman laughs] What is with that? 
 [Cut to a CLOSE UP OF HOUSE‚ÄôS FACE O_O! He is in the office with Wilson.] 
 House: I scored. [holds up an envelope] It‚Äôs a brave new world, Doc, and we are at the cutting edge. You are looking [Wilson pulls the envelope open‚Ä¶and his jaw drops to his knees!] at two all-access passes to Paradise itself! 
 Wilson: [finally shuts his mouth] How much? 
 House: True cost, no man can say. 
 Wilson: Could that man‚Äôs accountant say? 
 House: One thousand dollars. Friday night-the biggest official monster truck jam in the history of New Jersey! 
 Wilson: [looks horrified] Okay, please tell me you didn‚Äôt just say Friday night. 
 House: Whatever you‚Äôve got, you cancel. 
 Wilson: I-I can‚Äôt do it! 
 House: Listen, they only give these tickets to owners. [Wilson is stuttering like an idiot] Anytime. We wanna be in the middle of the track, we‚Äôre in the middle of the track. These tickets are so good‚Ä¶we have to sign a release. I mean it. We do this, we could die. 
 Wilson: I‚Äôve got the oncology thing! I-I‚Ä¶The rectal cancer lecture, they booked me a year ago! I-I-I-I-I can‚Äôt get out, there‚Äôs no way out! 
 House: [looks disappointed, then turns away] Fine. I‚Äôll ask one of my other friends. [gets up as Wilson snorts in disbelief, and he turns around.] What, you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôve only got one friend? 
 Wilson: Uh, and who‚Ä¶? 
 House: [thinks a moment] Kevin, in Bookkeeping. 
 Wilson: Okay, well first of all, his name‚Äôs Carl. 
 House: I call him Kevin. It‚Äôs a secret ‚Äúfriendship club‚Äù name. 
 [Cut back to the Ducklings at the bar.] 
 Chase: It‚Äôs hookers. 
 Cameron: Oh, my God! 
 Foreman: Multiple hookers! But House is House, right? He‚Äôs gotta have his way. Four or five of ‚Äòem. [Cameron looks disgusted] 
 Cameron: That‚Äôs not even funny! 
 Foreman: [quietly] What, you don‚Äôt think he has sex? 
 Cameron: No, of course he- 
 Chase: Of course not, he doesn‚Äôt have sex, he makes love! [Cameron can‚Äôt help laughing] 
 Cameron: I didn‚Äôt say that. [Foreman‚Äôs phone rings] 
 Foreman: It‚Äôs the lab. [answers it] Dr. Foreman. 
 [Cut to House sitting outside of Hank‚Äôs room, twirling his cane. Lola comes and sits in the chair across from him.] 
 Lola: If you have the results, I‚Äôd like you to talk to both of us. If you don‚Äôt, wait for me to- 
 House: Believe me, I‚Äôd much rather be with your better half. And by better half, of course, I mean the one who struck out Sammy Sosa on three pitches and talks a lot less. But I thought I would talk to you first, and alone. [picks up a folder and opens it] I got your results back from the lab‚Ä¶you DO match. 
 Lola: [looks shocked] I, I do? [House nods, and Lola looks happy and relieved.] 
 House: You‚Äôre also pregnant. [Lola gasps, and tears fill her eyes; a smile spreads wide across her face; House watches her reaction carefully.] You can‚Äôt be a donor. [Lola looks at him, confused] Not in your current condition. [She swallows hard, and manages a weak smile. A single tear spills down her face.] 
 Lola: Um‚Ä¶[wipes the tear away] Excuse me‚Ä¶I have to go talk to my husband. [gets up and walks quickly into Hank‚Äôs room; House shuts the folder and watches her leave.] 
 [Cut to Foreman in Hank‚Äôs room with him; he is studying a paper.] 
 Foreman: Heart looks good. We can schedule the transplant. 
 Hank: No transplant. Lola‚Äôs not gonna have an abortion. 
 Foreman: [unhooking wires from Hank‚Äôs chest] Actually, your wife just told me that she was making an appointment. 
 Hank: Well, I don‚Äôt care what she said. 
 Foreman: [stops and looks at him] I think you two need to discuss this further- 
 Hank: We‚Äôve been trying to get pregnant almost since we met. 
 Foreman: Well, it‚Äôs your wife‚Äôs decision whether or not she- 
 Hank: She wants to trade a child for a kidney, that‚Äôs m*rder! I‚Äôm not gonna let her do that. 
 [Cut to Cameron at House‚Äôs desk; he is just walking in the door.] 
 Cameron: Foreman says we‚Äôve got a problem with the transplant. 
 House: [walks over to the bookshelf and shuffles through it] If she terminates the pregnancy, he‚Äôs not going to let himself die on principle. 
 Cameron: ‚Ä¶Would you give up a baby for someone you love? 
 House: [turns around and gives her a piercing look] Please tell me I don‚Äôt have to decide. [Cameron looks hurt, and House lays off the sarcasm a little] Depends, how long would they live? 
 Cameron: Is this a pragmatic question for you? 
 House: Fifty years, no problem. Six months, I say let ‚Äòem die. Well, I‚Äôve actually given this a lot of thought, and my personal tipping point is seven years, eight months, and 14 days. 
 Cameron: [quietly] I couldn‚Äôt do it. 
 House: You found religion. 
 Cameron: Do you have to be religious to believe a fetus is a life? 
 House: There seems to be a correlation. [Cameron looks away; House watches her for a moment then looks away, eyes darting about awkwardly.] I‚Äôm, uh‚Ä¶[he fiddles with the books a moment] Do you like monster trucks? 
 Cameron: ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what they are. 
 House: ‚Ä¶Right. [he looks down for a moment] I got two tickets. [Cameron looks 
 at him, puzzled] Friday night. 
 Cameron: You asking me to go with you? 
 House: Sure. Sounds good. 
 Cameron: Like a‚Ä¶date? 
 House: Exactly. Except for the ‚Äúdate‚Äù part. [She stares at him, shocked speechless. He turns away quickly, embarrassed.] Forget it. [starts to walk to the computer desk] 
 Cameron: No, I-I was gonna go to the oncology dinner‚Ä¶ 
 House: ‚ÄòCourse, you have to hear Wilson‚Äôs lecture. [sits down] 
 Cameron: No. I just found out he canceled like, two weeks ago. [House‚Äôs expression changes to shock; he leans back in the chair and registers this. Meanwhile, Cameron comes to the door frame.] So‚Ä¶ [she makes a weird face] what do we wear? 
 [Cut to Hank‚Äôs room. Chase is there, holding two fingers against Hank‚Äôs neck while studying his heart rate. This can‚Äôt be good] 
 Chase: Still with us, Hank? 
 Hank: [groggily] Yeah. My chest feels funny‚Ä¶ 
 [Chase starts rubbing his fingers against Hank‚Äôs neck, attempting to stabilize his heart as Foreman and a nurse rush in.] 
 Chase: Tachycaridia. Your heart‚Äôs beating too fast. We‚Äôre sorting it out, but you stay with us, alright? [Foreman stares at the monitor in alarm] Keep talking to us, Hank. 
 Hank: Where‚Äôs Lola‚Ä¶? 
 Chase: [to Foreman] 10 units of insulin sub q, an IV push- 
 Nurse: It‚Äôs still dropping. 
 Foreman: Why‚Äôs his potassium up? 
 Chase: [presses his stethoscope against Hank‚Äôs chest] Damned if I know. 
 Foreman: [mutters something] Wee've got to suck the potassium out of him. We gotta get his heart rate down. 
 Nurse: Need a crash cart! [Chase empties something into Hank‚Äôs mouth] 
 Foreman: It‚Äôs definitely not Addison‚Äôs. 
 Chase: [glancing at the monitor] It‚Äôs not steroids either. 
 [Cut to House and Cameron on the way to Hank‚Äôs room.] 
 Cameron: His heart rate is 130 and rising, like a Randy Johnson line drive. 
 House: [thinks a moment] A for effort. 
 Cameron: There‚Äôs no point in doing the transplant. Even if he was stable enough, it‚Äôs obvious that we have no idea what‚Äôs wrong with him! 
 [Cut back to Hank‚Äôs room. Chase is uncapping an IV.] 
 Chase: First it‚Äôs too high, and now it‚Äôs too low? 
 Foreman: His heart‚Äôs not responding to the atropine. 
 [Cut to Lola and House in the hallway, Cameron meets up with them.] 
 Cameron: Heart rate‚Äôs down to 40. 
 House: I thought it was up. 
 Cameron: Now it‚Äôs down. Last time he went out at 35. 
 Lola: What‚Äôs wrong? [they enter Hank‚Äôs room] 
 House: I have no idea. [To Chase] Hit him with the atropine before he gets to 35 again. 
 Foreman: We‚Äôve already given him 3 ml. [Chase uncaps another IV] 
 House: Apparently, that‚Äôs not enough. 
 Chase: We can‚Äôt stabilize his heart rate. 
 House: What did you do to him? 
 Chase: Kayexolate. 
 Foreman: His pulse was through the roof. So is his potassium. 
 Chase: It wouldn‚Äôt do this. 
 House: But something did. [He sighs, and heads for the door] Call me when he‚Äôs stable‚Ä¶or dead. [leaves] 
 [Cut to Hank‚Äôs room later that night. Warner is sitting next to his bed, talking to Hank‚Äôs still figure.] 
 Warner: I remember the first time. You weren‚Äôt even supposed to be pitching that day. I‚Äôd flown all the way to Tokyo to watch this kid, and he gets tossed for arguing a call in the first inning. Ah, your pitches‚Ä¶perfect. Ball seemed to go faster than your arm. It was like the rules didn‚Äôt apply, like physics couldn‚Äôt slow you down. [he smiles at the memory] g*dd*mn, it was beautiful. [Hank‚Äôs eyes open, just slightly.] 
 Hank: Hey, Warner. [Warner looks at him, surprised, then breaks into a big grin.] 
 Warner: Hey, kid. How ya feelin‚Äô? 
 Hank: [softly] I hurt. My arm, my head‚Ä¶everywhere. 
 Warner: [nods] They must have dialed down the morphine. That‚Äôs just wrong, you‚Äôre in pain. Hey [reaches into his pocket and pulls out some pills] I got something for ya. [holds them out to Hank, who looks as surprised as a severely tired person can look] 
 Hank: No‚Ä¶ 
 Warner: A doc in St. Louis gave ‚Äòem to me for a migraine. 
 Hank: I‚Äôm an addict, I-I can‚Äôt take that. 
 Warner: Even Lola was okay with the morphine. This stuff‚Äôs just a little stronger. Go on. 
 [Hank slowly reaches a hand to take one, and‚Ä¶WE SEE THAT IT‚ÄôS A 
 HALLUCINATION! House is at the end of the bed, studying Hank‚Äôs movements carefully. Hank is reaching out to the imaginary Warner.] 
 Hank: I‚Äôll just try one, Warner. [As House is watching, Wilson comes in. House glances at him, then continues watching Hank.] 
 House: Three more symptoms. Heart rate up, heart rate down, now he‚Äôs hallucinating. 
 Hank: ‚Ä¶You gotta promise not to tell Lola‚Ä¶ 
 Wilson: He‚Äôs not just dreaming? 
 House: No REM. He‚Äôs actually awake. 
 Wilson: dr*gs? 
 House: Not psychedelics, not with the heart symptoms. 
 Wilson: All hallucinations would point to digitalis. It would also mess up his heart. But, he‚Äôs not on it, and why would he take it? 
 House: ‚Ä¶Yeah. Pithy analysis. [gets up]  I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm gonna miss it. 
 Wilson: I‚Äôm sorry about the monster trucks. 
 House: No, I think it‚Äôs great. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶giving back. [starts out the door] 
 Wilson: The only thing is‚Ä¶[House stops and turns around] the digitalis‚Ä¶it would only explain the later symptoms, not the original ones. [Turns to look at House. He thinks about this, and nods slightly to Wilson.] 
 [Cut to the baseball stadium. Warner is there, talking to another player who doesn‚Äôt look even remotely interested.] 
 Warner: Sure, it‚Äôs got a lotta movement, problem is everybody sees the 
 movement. Yer throwing yer curve ball, like yer throwing a curve ball. [he turns to 
 the player] Deception, that‚Äôs it. [he suddenly spots House, who is sitting a few rows over.] Same motion, less movement, so it won‚Äôt come back at ya. [moves away and sits down next to House] How‚Äôd you get in here? 
 House: Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican. 
 Warner: How‚Äôs Hank doin‚Äô? 
 House: Lousy. [he studies Warner‚Äôs hands with a keen interest] Around your fingernails, that swelling, it‚Äôs called clubbing. Hippocrates noticed that a lot of his friends who also had that, tended to frequently grab their chests and die. 
 Warner: Yeah, I got a heart condition. What‚Äôs wrong with Hank? 
 House: What do you take for it? 
 Warner: Digitalis. 
 House: Got ‚Äòem with you? [Warner reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a half-empty/half-full bottle.] 
 Warner: That‚Äôs weird. I just filled this prescription a couple days ago. There‚Äôs another bottle here. [searches through his pockets.] 
 House: Don‚Äôt bother. [Warner stops and looks at him.] Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to k*ll himself. [Warner stares at House. House stares right back. STARING CONTEST!] 
 [Cut to House in Hank‚Äôs room, watching him intensely.] 
 House: So what happened? He left the bottle open, while he went to get some 
 water? Next time, just take the whole bottle. 
 Hank: [shaking his head slowly] Hey man, you got no right- 
 House: See, people remember how many they‚Äôve got. Date‚Äôs right on the label, number of pills, regular person can do the math. But a junkie doesn‚Äôt have to. It‚Äôs how many pills he‚Äôs got left, that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs thinking about. Bought a big insurance policy? 
 Hank: [laughs bitterly] This isn‚Äôt about the money. 
 House: Not for you, no. Most reputable stores won‚Äôt cash your checks after you‚Äôre dead. But for Lola-well, girls like that, they‚Äôre all about the money- 
 Hank: Don‚Äôt you say that. She already saved my life. I was dead in Japan and she brought me back, everything since then, that‚Äôs gravy, it‚Äôs more than I deserve. 
 House: You owe her. 
 Hank: Everything. 
 House: [nods] So, the attempted su1c1de, the scaring her to death, that‚Äôs-what is that, that‚Äôs-gratitude? Love? Yeah, I get that. [Hank stares at the ceiling] We‚Äôll take out what you did to yourself yesterday, we‚Äôre back to the kidneys and the bones. [as he stands up, he sets his cane down near Hank‚Äôs urine bag.] I‚Äôm scheduling the transplant. [turns to leave, but Hank lashes out suddenly, grabbing House‚Äôs coat. House stumbles against the urine bag, and his pants get drenched‚Ä¶eeeew! He looks down at his pants in disgust and anger.] NEVER visit a patient. 
 Hank: I want that baby! [House fixes him with a cold glare] Even if I‚Äôm gone, that‚Äôs a piece of me, and Lola. Breathing. Walkin‚Äô around town. Goin‚Äô to baseball games. [releases House‚Äôs coat] If there‚Äôs any more transplant talk from you, or Lola, or anybody else‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt screw it up this time. I‚Äôll take myself out for good. 
 [House‚Äôs glare melts into defeat] 
 House: [nods slowly] I‚Äôll start treating the Addison‚Äôs, which will most likely destroy what‚Äôs left of your kidneys- 
 Hank: Fine. Start the treatment. 
 [Cut to the elevator doors opening; House steps out, staring at his pant leg disgustedly. He starts down the hallway, and Wilson catches up with him.] 
 Wilson: Hey. [he looks down at House‚Äôs pants questioningly] 
 House: [irritatedly] Hank Wiggen peed on me. What d‚Äôyou think these pants are worth on eBay? 
 Wilson: I‚Äôve got some big-boy diapers in my office, the rep. hands them out like candy. 
 House: Is it that bad? 
 Wilson: [sarcastically] No! Not if you like the smell of urine- 
 House: ‚ÄòCourse, why should I trust someone who lies about what he‚Äôs doing Friday night? [stops to face Wilson] Question is, what are you really doing Friday night? Or more to the point, what could possibly be better than monster trucks? Or are we breaking up? [turns to enter his office. Wilson lets out a long sigh, then follows House inside. House is rummaging through his duffel bag.] 
 Wilson: ‚Ä¶Stacy‚Äôs coming into town this weekend, we‚Äôre having dinner. Just‚Ä¶catching up. 
 House: I definitely had pants here. [turns to face Wilson] Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper? I heard she‚Äôs playing Atlantic City. 
 Wilson: No, Stacy the Constitutional Lawyer. [House looks mildly surprised for a second] 
 House: You thought I couldn‚Äôt handle this news. [Wilson‚Äôs eyes fall to the floor and he nods. House turns his attention to the bag] You talk to her a lot? 
 Wilson: No. It‚Äôs been a long time. [House continues staring at the bag] If you don‚Äôt want me to see her- 
 House: What is this, eighth grade? [looks at Wilson] I‚Äôm fine. 
 Wilson: ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre upset- 
 House: [suddenly] No! It‚Äôs‚Ä¶[zips the bag quickly and controls his voice] I have no right to be upset. You two are friends. [looks back at Wilson calmly] You should see her. Say hi for me. 
 Wilson: So‚Ä¶you‚Äôre okay. 
 House: [tosses the bag under his desk] I‚Äôm not the cancer doctor who‚Äôs lying about the cancer dinner. [takes his cane off the desk] I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs betraying all those‚Ä¶bald-headed dying kids. [Wilson smirks, and House heads out the door] I‚Äôm gonna go get some pants, I stink. 
 [House continues down the hallway and meets up with Lola, uh-oh.] 
 Lola: You‚Äôre treating him for Addison‚Äôs and you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna work?! 
 House: He tried to k*ll himself. 
 Lola: I know. He‚Äôs confused. We can have another baby, I can make him understand that. I‚Äôm having an abortion. We do the trans- 
 House: No. 
 Lola: [indignantly] I can make decisions about my body. 
 House: And he can make decisions about his. He doesn‚Äôt want your kidney. [Lola looks shocked and upset] 
 Lola: So‚Ä¶he‚Äôll die? 
 House: ‚Ä¶Probably. 
 [Lola starts to cry, and House looks uncomfortable. She looks at him with tears in her eyes‚Ä¶AND HUGS HIM! WHOA! House looks shocked, to say the least. He makes sure that the hallway is empty, then leans down closer to her ear.] 
 House: If you keep that appointment, he‚Äôll also probably die. [Lola sobs into his shoulder] Keep the baby. [He reaches up and awkwardly pats her shoulder. He makes a face as the smell of the urine meets his nose.] 
 House: ‚Ä¶Are you just being polite? [She pulls away from him, confused] See, my pants are‚Ä¶[gestures to his leg] 
 Lola: Oh, they‚Äôre all wet. [House looks at her, puzzled] 
 House: ‚Ä¶You can‚Äôt smell that? [she shakes her head, and he looks intently at her, processing this.] 
 [Cut to Cameron and Chase eating dinner. Two other plates are on the table-Foreman is here with someone also.] 
 Cameron: Think she‚Äôll abort anyway, try to force his hand? 
 Chase: No, she‚Äôs not gonna risk losing him. [he looks at her and chuckles] 
 Cameron: [gives him a strange look] That‚Äôs funny? 
 Chase: N-no, the monster trucks? House asking you, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶that‚Äôs funny. 
 Cameron: I was the first person he ran into, he just‚Ä¶asked me. 
 Chase: Yeah, like a date! 
 Cameron: Exactly. Except for the ‚Äúdate‚Äù part. [Chase chuckles again. Sharon comes over, toting a glass of wine.] 
 Sharon: If the patient decides to go the dialysis route, we got some product you should check out. [smiles as Foreman sits down] Hey, Dr. Foreman. 
 Chase: Courtesy of the generous Sharon and the good folks at Casting Pharmaceuticals. 
 Sharon: I was just telling the guys about the Bermuda conference in April. 
 Cameron: Three days of sun and scuba, and one hour of lecture. [House suddenly comes out of nowhere and walks up to the table] 
 Chase: [laughing] Oh God, do we have to go to the lecture? 
 House: [looking down at Sharon] So, you‚Äôre the new Arnie. 
 Sharon: Dr. House. It‚Äôs, uh, good to see you. [Foreman glares at House] 
 House: Would you get me a coffee? Black, no sugar. [Sharon smiles, confused, and leaves the table. House sits down, turns his attention to the Ducklings.] Okay, so who is it? [The Ducklings look confused] Come on, she‚Äôs sleeping with one of you. [Chase snorts, and House looks hopefully at Cameron] Oh God, please tell me it‚Äôs you. [Cameron looks shocked] 
 Cameron: She buys lunches! She doesn‚Äôt- 
 House: Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not gay‚Ä¶you‚Äôre adventurous! [Ducklings roll their eyes] 
 Chase: You think she‚Äôs gonna prost*tute herself? The three of us are that important to her? 
 House: I‚Äôm afraid not, no. The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick. 
 Foreman: And‚Ä¶you‚Äôre Mick? 
 House: [eating off Sharon‚Äôs plate] That was the metaphor I was making, yes. 
 Foreman: Why are you here? 
 House:[studies Foreman a moment] Damn, it‚Äôs you. [All eyes on Foreman, how embarrassing!] It‚Äôs not Addison‚Äôs. New symptom: the inability to smell. 
 Foreman: I was just in Hank‚Äôs room, and he said it smelled like the men‚Äôs room at Veteran‚Äôs Stadium. He was right. 
 House: We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy. Well, she‚Äôs not. Last six months, she can‚Äôt smell a thing. If you think of them as one single patient, add her symptoms to his‚Ä¶[Chase nods] 
 Chase: Cadmium poisoning. 
 House: It explains everything. Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant. 
 Cameron: How could they have gotten exposed to that much cadmium? 
 Foreman: Unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast. [Chase is thinking, watch out!] 
 House: So, where else is cadmium? 
 Foreman: Some foods, polluted groundwater, we should check their home- 
 Chase: I think I know how it happened. 
 [Cut to Chase in Hank‚Äôs room. Lola is at Hank‚Äôs bed.] 
 Chase: I‚Äôm gonna need another urine sample. 
 Lola: What for- 
 Hank: [resignedly] Sure, whatever you want. 
 Chase: [looks at him suspiciously] Why wouldn‚Äôt you give it to me before but now it‚Äôs no problem? 
 Hank: I‚Äôm dyin‚Äô, right? 
 Chase: So you‚Äôve got nothing to lose this time. Begs the question‚Ä¶[walks over to Hank] what were you worried about last time? [Lola looks down at Hank, confused] The funny thing is, when we tested you before, we were just looking for steroids. [Looking directly at Hank] What should we look for now, Hank? 
 Lola: [slowly realizes] Hank? [moves away from him slightly] What‚Äôs the story? 
 Chase: A little weed every now and then when no one was looking? [Lola walks over to the window, shocked] 
 Lola: I don‚Äôt believe this. We quit. 
 Chase: You did. If you‚Äôd kept going, you wouldn‚Äôt have just lost your sense of smell. 
 Hank: No, I quit the hard stuff. [Lola looks skeptical] I just needed to relax. 
 Chase: Based on the symptoms, you‚Äôre a lot more than a social user. 
 Lola: [bitterly] So you‚Äôve been lying to me all this time. 
 Hank: ‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry. 
 Chase: There must‚Äôve been cadmium in the soil where the marijuana was grown. Some people get bone loss, kidney failure, some people‚Äôs testes shrink, and some people lose their sense of smell. We‚Äôll start treating it right away. You should be fine by opening day. Baseball‚Äôs in the summer, right? 
 Lola: [panicking] It didn‚Äôt hurt the baby, did it? The cadmium? 
 Chase: If you‚Äôve been clean, the baby should be fine. 
 Lola: Okay. [Chase moves to the other end of the room. Hank stares at Lola desperately] 
 Hank: Please. I‚Äôll stop everything, I‚Äôll-I‚Äôll go to meetings every day! [Lola stares into the distance] Lola. 
 Lola: [stares at him determinedly] Twice a day. 
 [Cut to House and Cuddy exiting the elevator.] 
 Cuddy: How‚Äôd the ballplayer doing? 
 House: Much better. 
 Cuddy: Too bad about his career. 
 House: What d‚Äôyou mean? 
 Cuddy: Major League Baseball‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement requires medical reports on all treatment. Even Hank‚Äôs history is not likely to get much leniency. 
 [stops outside of her office] 
 House: Why should they care that he‚Äôs being treated for Addison‚Äôs? 
 Cuddy: [suspiciously] You‚Äôre not treating him for Addison‚Äôs! 
 House: My report says I am. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôre lying on the report?! 
 House: Everybody does stupid things, it shouldn‚Äôt cost them everything they want in life. 
 Cuddy: [hesitantly] No, it shouldn‚Äôt, but it usually does. [A smile crosses her face] On the other hand, it means someone can actually beat the Yankees. [enters her office, and House leaves] 
 [Cut to Foreman and Sharon at dinner.] 
 Sharon: So what about House, any way to get him down there? 
 Foreman: You really wanna‚Ä¶talk about work? 
 Sharon: No. Not at all‚Ä¶[stares into his eyes. Ugh, mushy XP] 
 [Cut to Chase and Lola in Hank‚Äôs room. Chase is gently stretching Hank‚Äôs arm as Lola watches. Hank grins at her, and she smiles back.] 
 [Cut to a shot of Gravedigger‚Äôs truck at the monster truck rally. House and 
 Cameron come around the corner, eating cotton candy.] 
 Cameron: That was amazing! 
 House: I‚Äôm telling you, Gravedigger never disappoints. [Cameron sees a couple pass by, arms around each other.] 
 Cameron: You ever been married? 
 House: [quietly] Well now, let‚Äôs not ruin a lovely night out by getting personal. 
 [They walk along in silence for a few seconds] 
 House: I lived with someone for a while. [Looks down at his empty cotton candy cone, then at Cameron‚Äôs] You gonna finish that? 
 [He shifts the cone to his cane hand and Cameron hands her cotton candy to him. He only has time to grab a piece off before she snatches it back playfully, ignoring his mumbled protests and laughing. They walk off screen.] 
 Cameron‚Äôs Voice: I‚Äôll race you to the car!","[': Heart looks good. We can schedule the transplant. \n Hank: No transplant.

house_1_19,412142,1,19,"[Opens at the Swimming and Diving National Championships.  There are clips of people swimming and diving, the spectators, and the judges.  Turns to Mary and her coach.] 
 Coach: Visualizing?  [Mary nods.]  All right.  You‚Äôre up, tiger.  You feel all right?  You look a little pale. 
 Mary: I‚Äôm fine. 
 Coach: Does your neck still hurt? 
 Mary: It‚Äôll be fine. 
 Coach: You know, maybe you should do the two and a half instead. 
 Mary: I‚Äôm gonna do the three. 
 Coach: Well, it‚Äôs better to nail the two and a half than ‚Äì 
 Mary: I‚Äôm gonna nail the three. 
 Coach: All right.  Well, let‚Äôs show these senior citizens what a well-coached twelve-year-old can do, huh?  [Mary takes off her jacket and climbs the steps to the diving platform.] 
 Announcer: The next diver: two-time National Junior Champion Mary Carroll.  [Mary reaches the top of the platform.  Her vision goes a bit blurry, but she shakes it off and stands on the edge, preparing for her dive.] 
 Mary: Damn it, you can do this, come on.  Just‚Ä¶ see it, see it.  [She steps back on her toes.  The judges stare at her.]  Big jump, let it count.  Rip it.  [She jumps, and nails the dive.  She resurfaces triumphantly, to a silent pool.  Something‚Äôs up.  Everyone is staring at one of the judges, who has collapsed.] 
 A Coach: Call 911.  We need an ambulance!  [The judge is bleeding out of 
 his ear.  And with that psych, we go to the opening credits.] 
 [Cut to Cameron‚Äôs apartment (which has the same color walls as House‚Äôs place ‚Äì Princeton‚Äôs interior designer must really like that color), where she is working out on her treadmill.  There is a knock at the door, strangely wooden.  She opens the door to find House there, knocking with his cane.] 
 House: I saw the light on. 
 Cameron: It‚Äôs daytime. 
 House: Yeah, it‚Äôs a figure of speech.  Always so literal. 
 Cameron: Got a new cane. 
 House: Yeah.  Guy in the store said it was slimming.  Vertical stripe‚Ä¶ 
 Cameron: Why are you here? 
 House: Vogler is dead. 
 Cameron: What?  What happened? 
 House: Again with the literal translation.  Vogler the idea, Mr. Destructo, Mr. Moneybags, bow down before me; he is gone from the hospital, so things can go back to the way they were. 
 Cameron: The way they were was kind of weird. 
 House: Weird works for me. 
 Cameron: What are you saying?  Literally? 
 House: I want you to come back. 
 Cameron: Why?  [House‚Äôs beeper goes off, Cameron crosses her arms.] 
 House: Please unclench.  You‚Äôre not on the clock, and when you do that, I clench, and then it‚Äôs the whole thing‚Ä¶ 
 Cameron: Could you look at your pager?  [House looks at it.] 
 House: It‚Äôs no big deal, some sort of epidemic.  Not my area. 
 Cameron: You should go, it‚Äôs important. 
 House: What I‚Äôm doing now is important. 
 Cameron: Why do you want me back? 
 House: Because you‚Äôre a good doctor. 
 Cameron: That‚Äôs it? 
 House: That‚Äôs not enough? 
 Cameron: Not for me.  Go deal with your plague.  [She closes the door and locks it.] 
 [Cut to the lobby of the hospital, filled to the brim with patients and doctors alike.  House is slightly overwhelmed by the number of people.] 
 Overhead speaker voice: You are in a quarantined area.  Please remain calm and stay in line.  A doctor will see you shortly.  When you see a doctor, you will receive a blue or yellow form.  Patients with blue forms must immediately enter the parking lot‚Ä¶ [House starts to leave.] 
 Cuddy: [leaving the clinic and heading toward him] Dr. House!  We need you here. 
 House: Sorry, lot of sick people.  I might catch something. 
 Cuddy: A judge at the campus pool center collapsed, LP revealed a virulent form of bacterial meningitis. 
 House: Great, got it diagnosed, you don‚Äôt need me. 
 Cuddy: 2500 people at the pool center were exposed.  They‚Äôre being bused to all the neighboring hospitals. 
 House: That‚Äôs a problem of resources, not diagnostics.  No, I‚Äôd be completely lost, get in everyone‚Äôs way. 
 Cuddy: Joe!  [A security guard ‚Äì Joe, probably ‚Äì stops House from leaving.]  Dr. House doesn‚Äôt have a blue slip.  No one leaves the quarantine area without a blue slip. You are a doctor at this hospital: act like one.  And [she grabs a cup of pills] take these.  [House does so.] 
 [Cut to House, doing checks on people in an exam room.] 
 House: [reading a thermometer] 102.  You win a trip to the second floor.  Next! 
 [Cut to Wilson doing checks.] 
 Wilson: All right, no fever, no rash, you‚Äôre fine.  Take these two pills, and show this blue slip to Security on your way out.  Next! 
 [Back to House, this time with a middle-aged woman.] 
 House: Take these, go home, talk to your daughter. Patient: What? 
 House: Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned.  Everything except your jacket, it‚Äôs got a smudge on it.  Probably two days old.  Which means you didn‚Äôt know the jacket had been worn.  So either your husband is a crossdresser or your daughter has been borrowing your clothes without telling you.  Probably wants to look older to get into bars. 
 Patient: I don‚Äôt have a daughter.  [House hands her a blue slip.] 
 House: Next! 
 [Cut to Chase, dealing with a patient.] 
 Patient: So I have it. 
 Chase: Yellow form to the second form, you‚Äôre gonna be fine. 
 Patient: I‚Äôm gonna die! 
 Chase: It‚Äôs treatable as long as you go to the second floor.  Next. 
 [Cut to House checking Mary‚Äôs temperature.] 
 House: Yow. 
 Mary: Fever.  Does that mean I have it? 
 House: You have a rash?  Come on.  [Mary lifts her jacket to reveal a red rash on her hip.] 
 Mary: It‚Äôs from my new bathing suit, I‚Äôve had it a week. 
 House: Yeah.  Does your neck hurt?  If it does, you get the trifecta. 
 Mary: It‚Äôs nothing.  I pulled it trying to do a three-and-a-half tuck. 
 House: Where are your parents? 
 Mary: We live in Chicago.  I‚Äôm here with my coach.  [She cranes her neck to look at what House is writing on her chart.]  I wanted to see what you were writing. 
 House: [turns his neck] Go like this.  [Mary turns her head to the left and to the right, which hurts her.]  Now like this. [She then nods it to her chest and up, which doesn‚Äôt hurt at all.] 
 [Cut to Foreman dealing with patients.] 
 Foreman: Take these pills.  A blue slip will get you out of here.  Next!  [He automatically puts his hands up, to find House next in line.] 
 House: You‚Äôre coming with me.  [After looking at his pile of blue slips, Foreman follows.] 
 [Cut to Chase.] 
 Chase: You‚Äôre going to need a CT scan.  Second floor, take the elevators, follow the parade.  Next!  [House whistles to him from the doorway.  Chase goes to.] 
 [Cut to House, Foreman and Chase walking down a very crowed hallway.] 
 Chase: Maybe something systemic. 
 Foreman: Or maybe it‚Äôs meningitis. 
 House: She‚Äôs had the rash a week.  If it was this meningitis, she‚Äôd be dead by now.  [Cuddy walks up.] 
 Cuddy: You guys figure we‚Äôre done down there?  The 800 people milling around are just waiting for the bathroom? 
 House: 12-year-old female.  Fever, rash, neck pains.  Not meningitis. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs the definition of meningitis! 
 House: Sure, pus in the spinal canal makes it hurt to move your head up and down, but her head only hurts moving side to side. 
 Cuddy: Oh, side to side. 
 House: Doesn‚Äôt fit. 
 Cuddy: The three of you, lobby, now. 
 House: Those little pills you‚Äôre passing out so efficiently aren‚Äôt going to do 
 Miss Louganis squat. 
 Cuddy: You just don‚Äôt want to deal with the epidemic. 
 House: That‚Äôs right.  I‚Äôm subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous and evasive tests to avoid being bored.  [Everyone stares at him.]  Okay, maybe I would do that, but I‚Äôm not.  If it turns out she does have meningitis, you‚Äôre right, you win, but if we go back downstairs and she dies‚Ä¶ your face will be so red. 
 Cuddy: You have one hour.  [She st*lks off.] 
 House: Get a lumbar puncture.  Some brain infections can be pretty clever at hide-and-seek. 
 Chase: I‚Äôll get on her bloodwork. 
 House: No you won‚Äôt.  You, sir, will research all the causes in the universe of neck pain. 
 Chase: The list is, like, two miles long! 
 House: Start with the letter A.  And put her on rifampin. 
 Foreman: Rifampin is for meningitis.  You just said ‚Äì 
 House: In case I‚Äôm wrong.  It has happened. 
 [Cut to the nurse‚Äôs desk, where everyone is pestering a very harried Brenda the nurse.] 
 Doctor #1: Brenda, I need a CBC count 7 and 2046. 
 Brenda: Hold on.  [Foreman pushes his way through.] 
 Doctor #2: Hey, hey, there‚Äôs a line here! 
 Foreman: That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äòexcuse me.‚Äô  Brenda, I need a bed, and‚Ä¶ 
 Doctor #3: We all need stuff. 
 Foreman: Push me again.  Brenda, I need a bed and a nurse for a lumbar puncture. 
 Brenda: No beds, no nurses for at least 4 hours. 
 Foreman: I‚Äôve only got one. 
 Brenda: Your patient only has an hour to live unless she gets a lumbar puncture? 
 Foreman: Cuddy only gave us an hour to work on the patient. 
 Brenda: Back of the line.  [The other doctors laugh at him as he leaves.] 
 [Cut to Foreman, trying to do a lumbar puncture on Mary in the middle of the hallway on a gurney.] 
 Foreman: This novocaine will numb you for the lumbar puncture.  Sorry this has to be so public, Mary. 
 Mary: Normally I‚Äôm in a bathing suit with 5000 people staring at my butt.  I can block this out.  [Foreman raises his eyebrows at the coach.] 
 Coach: These kids are all very mature.  Travel around the country from event to event. 
 Foreman: Okay, I need you to hold your knees and tuck your head. 
 Mary: Like a dive? 
 Foreman: Exactly.  [She does so.]  Good, great.  Don‚Äôt forget to breathe.  [He‚Äôs about to start the puncture when someone hits the gurney.] 
 Person: Sorry! 
 Foreman: Geez!  Coach, help me out here, play a little defense before I poke the wrong thing?  Okay, here we go.  [He starts the puncture.] 
 Mary: Ow, I feel, ow, I feel it, ow! 
 Foreman: Try to relax, Mary, try to relax. 
 [Cut to Chase, researching on the laptop.] 
 House: What letter are you up to? 
 Chase: A. 
 House: t*rture combing through all that stuff, ain‚Äôt it?  Real dull.  Awful. 
 Chase: It‚Äôs no problem. 
 House: Well, thank goodness.  A lot of people would resent having to do this. 
 [Cut to Foreman looking around for Brenda.] 
 Foreman: [to a nurse] Where‚Äôs the 12-year-old girl that was here? 
 Nurse: Needed the gurney. 
 Foreman: She just had a lumbar puncture, she‚Äôs not supposed to be moved! 
 Nurse: Sorry, we needed the gurney.  [Foreman walks the hallways, looking for Mary, and finds her lying on a couch.] 
 Foreman: Hey. 
 Coach: Hey. 
 Foreman: You okay?  How‚Äôs your head feeling? 
 Coach: She‚Äôs got a headache, and she‚Äôs dizzy. 
 Foreman: She shouldn‚Äôt have been moved after the procedure, I‚Äôm sorry. 
 Mary: I‚Äôm fine, what did the test show? 
 Foreman: No meningitis, no other infections. 
 Mary: But you‚Äôre not carrying a blue form.  I have something else, don‚Äôt I? 
 Foreman: Something‚Äôs causing your symptoms.  We‚Äôre going to keep you overnight.  I know it‚Äôs a little crazy here, but hopefully things will settle down and we‚Äôll get you a room.  [Mary starts to cry.] 
 Mary: I‚Äôm sorry.  I‚Äôm not usually all emotional like this. 
 Coach: You‚Äôre doing great.  Your folks will land in a few hours. 
 Mary: I just‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt slept, I‚Äôm so tired.  [She wipes her eyes.]  Oh my God, my eye‚Äôs bleeding.  What is it, what‚Äôs happening?  [Foreman checks it out with his pocket flashlight.] 
 Foreman: Oh, don‚Äôt worry.  The antibiotic we gave you in case you had meningitis can turn your tears reddish.  That‚Äôs not blood.  [He notices something, and opens her mouth to reveal bloody teeth and gums.]  But that‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs blood. 
 [Cut to Mary looking into a endoscope.] 
 Mary: That‚Äôs going into my stomach? 
 Chase: The vials showed blood in your GI tract.  We need to find out where it‚Äôs coming from.  You won‚Äôt feel it.  I‚Äôm going to numb the back of your throat and Dr. Foreman is going to give you a sedative.  Open.  [Mary opens her mouth, and Chase sprays her throat.  The three of them are gathering a crowd of spectators.]  Swallow.  Now lay on your side for me.  And here we go.  [Chase rolls his eyes at the people crowding him.]  Yell ‚Äúfire,‚Äù or something. 
 Foreman: People, this area is highly contagious.  Please step back.  Highly contagious. 
 Chase: All right.  Try to relax, Mary, this shouldn‚Äôt take too long.  [He inserts the scope, and he and Foreman watch it‚Äôs progress on the monitor.] 
 Foreman: Don‚Äôt see any tears or lesions. 
 Chase: All right, I‚Äôm in her stomach.  There‚Äôs no bleeding. 
 Foreman: There was more than a tablespoon of blood in her stomach, so it‚Äôs got to be there.  Maybe her small intestine. 
 Chase: 30 feet of digestive tract, it could be anywhere in there.  We‚Äôre not going to see it with this. 
 [Cut to Chase, holding up a pill camera.] 
 Chase: Believe it or not, this is a camera.  You swallow it, and it goes all the way through your system.  The antennae pick up the signal from the pill.  [Mary is wearing a belt with the sensor equipment.]  We‚Äôre going to look at the video of your intestines, see where the blood is coming from, and fix it.  Water?  Down the hatch.  [She swallows it.] 
 [Cut to the three doctors watching the camera footage in House‚Äôs office.] 
 House: Think I‚Äôve seen this movie.  The ending‚Äôs kind of dark.  [He offers some candy to Foreman.]  Want one?  [He pretends to offer one to Chase, but takes it away when he starts to take one.]  How come you did the endoscopy? 
 Chase: He asked for help! 
 Foreman: Her blood pressure was high, I was worried ‚Äì 
 House: Foreman is not your boss.  When I tell you to do something ‚Äì whoa.  Hold it there.  Back it up a couple of frames.  [He looks intently at the image on the screen.]  Oh, yeah!  That‚Äôs your money shot. 
 Foreman: I don‚Äôt see anything. 
 House: Really?  Ginormous thing on the right side of her intestine doesn‚Äôt even intrigue you? 
 Foreman: Does ginormous mean really big or really, really big, ‚Äòcause I don‚Äôt see anything. 
 Chase: There?  A Dieulafoy? 
 Foreman: Oh.  Well, we can burn off the swollen blood vessel, but it still doesn‚Äôt account for her other symptoms. 
 House: No, but it does tell us something.  Though I have no idea what. 
 Foreman: Could be a precursor to intestinal intussusception. 
 House: Precursor isn‚Äôt causing all of her other symptoms.  What else?  [Cuddy enters.] 
 Cuddy: You, in the lobby, now. 
 House: I hurt my leg.  I have a note. 
 Cuddy: You had your hour.  Three, actually. 
 House: Dr. Chase, I told you to tell us when our time was up.  She has intestinal bleeding. 
 Cuddy: She‚Äôll wait.  Two more buses just arrived.  We need you downstairs. 
 House: No, you need more nurses.  But you cut back on the nursing staff so you have doctors doing what the nurses should be doing. 
 Cuddy: That‚Äôs true.  I wonder if that has anything to do you with you costing us $100 million. 
 [Cut to House, Foreman,  Chase and Wilson seeing patients and talking about Mary at the same time.] 
 House: [to patient, handing her a blue slip] Go, be free.  [A bouncy teen walks up.] 
 Foreman: It‚Äôs not the intussusception, what about stomach cancer? 
 Wilson: Does she have any abdominal pain? 
 Chase: No. 
 Wilson: Then it‚Äôs not stomach cancer.  Have you ruled out sepsis? 
 Chase: The LP and blood smear showed no signs of infection.  [hands a blue slip to a patient] Here.  Take these two pills and you can go.  [House sniffs the hair of his patient.] 
 Foreman: Well, the lab‚Äôs working at double their capacity, maybe someone screwed up. 
 House: No fever, no neck pain.  Take the elevator to the third floor. 
 Wilson: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong form.  No fever, no neck pain, she‚Äôs fine. 
 House: Smell her hair, no chlorine.  Which means she wasn‚Äôt at the pool.  Which means she‚Äôs come to a quarantined area because she‚Äôs a idiot or she‚Äôs insane.  No one is that stupid.  East wing, psych ward, bye-bye.  [She wanders off.] 
 Chase: Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer. 
 House: You up to Bs?  Well done! 
 Wilson: It would account for all her meningial symptoms.  Rash, fever‚Ä¶ [to patient]  You‚Äôre fine.  Take these two pills‚Ä¶ 
 House: [to Foreman] Get a sample of her bone marrow. 
 Foreman: From here? 
 House: Break time. 
 Foreman: Need more than 15 minutes. 
 House: Use Chase‚Äôs break, too.  Go. 
 [Cut to House and Wilson walking in the hall.] 
 Wilson: You should just fire Chase. 
 House: What, and miss out on all this fun? 
 Wilson: So you‚Äôre going to t*rture him for a while and then fire him?  That‚Äôs cold. 
 House: You don‚Äôt think he has it coming? 
 Wilson: Hey, I said fire him.  [Random patient in the hallway vomits.  I say because I care.] 
 House: That‚Äôs cold.  All he did was save his job. 
 Wilson: What?  He completely screwed you over!  [House spies Cuddy walking there way.] 
 House: Right rudder.  [She follows.]  Bank, bank, bank! 
 Cuddy: Good coffee?  [Having stopped the show here, I‚Äôd like to point out that right here, both House and Wilson are staring at Cuddy‚Äôs cleavage.  Bwah.]  The rest of this hospital is busting it‚Äôs tail, and‚Ä¶ [House raises the chart he‚Äôs holding to cover Cuddy‚Äôs midsection.]  What are you doing? 
 House: Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods.  [Wilson tries not to smile/laugh.] 
 Cuddy: I am‚Ä¶ working, it got hot, stop acting like a 13-year-old! 
 House: Sorry, you just don‚Äôt usually see breasts like that on Deans of Medicine. 
 Cuddy: Oh, women can‚Äôt be heads of hospitals?  Or just ugly ones? 
 House: No, they can be babes.  You just don‚Äôt usually see their funbags. 
 Cuddy: Your 3 o‚Äôclock interview for Dr. Cameron‚Äôs position is in your office. 
 House: Ah, not interviewing today.  I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard, but there‚Äôs this big time epidemic.  Many sick people puking in the hallways, it‚Äôs crazy. 
 Wilson: I‚Äôll send the interview home, we can reschedule. 
 Cuddy: No, you won‚Äôt.  You will interview this person, and if he can put two sentences together you will send him to the lobby where he will do his job.  Unlike the two of you. 
 [Cut to Foreman, once again trying to get things out of Brenda.] 
 Foreman: Come on, you know I can‚Äôt do a bone marrow aspiration in the hallway. 
 Brenda: And I can‚Äôt give you a procedure room. 
 Foreman: I just need something at least close to a sterile environment. 
 Brenda: I need 10 more nurses. 
 Foreman: Brenda, listen, listen.  She‚Äôll die. 
 Brenda: At least she‚Äôll have a bed, then. [to another nurse] Put that over there.  [And an idea hits Dr. Foreman!] 
 [Cut to‚Ä¶ the morgue.  Yup, you heard me.] 
 Mary: Are there dead people in those cabinets? 
 Foreman: I hope that‚Äôs who‚Äôs in there.  Just be calm, relax. 
 Mary: Ow, ow. 
 Foreman: Hang on, hang on.  Almost done. 
 [Cut to House with Doctor #1, Roger Spain (or as he‚Äôs known to the rest of the world, Ben Jelen).  Wilson is there to stop it from getting bloody.] 
 Dr. Spain:  You know, I really admire the way you don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks.  You just do what you want, the way you want. 
 Wilson: So, you went to Hopkins for both undergrad and med school? 
 Dr. Spain: That‚Äôs right. 
 House: He‚Äôs in a band. 
 Dr. Spain: You into music? 
 House: Totally.  What kind of music do you play? 
 Dr. Spain: Um, mostly blues, you know.  James Cotton, some original stuff. 
 House: [pops a Vicodin] Oh, dude.  You are so hired. 
 Dr. Spain: Really? 
 House: Not a chance. 
 Dr. Spain: Why? 
 House: Tattoo. [Dr. Spain turns his right arm to reveal a kanji symbol on his forearm.] 
 Dr. Spain: Wow.  I thought you‚Äôd be the last person to have a problem with nonconformity. 
 House: Nonconformity, right.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw a 20-something kid with a tattoo of an Asian letter on his wrist.  You are one wicked free thinker.  You want to be a rebel?  Stop being cool.  Wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut.  Like the Asian kids who don‚Äôt leave the library for 20 hours stretches, they‚Äôre the ones who don‚Äôt care what you think.  Sayonara.  [Dr. Spain leaves.] 
 Wilson: So should I go through all the resumes looking for Asian names? 
 House: Actually, the Asian kids are probably just responding to parental pressure, but my point is still valid. 
 [Cut to Mary, who has a bed in the hallway.  Her team is gathered around 
 her.] 
 Teammate #1: So when do they think you‚Äôre getting out of here? 
 Mary: I don‚Äôt know. 
 Teammate #2: You don‚Äôt look sick. 
 Teammate #1: Better hope you‚Äôre not, this equipment looks like it‚Äôs 100 years old. [Foreman walks up.] 
 Foreman: Just got it out of storage.  It is the previous generation, but it works just fine.  Could you guys give us a second? 
 Mary: If it‚Äôs good news, you can tell them. 
 Foreman: Okay.  We‚Äôre pretty sure it‚Äôs not cancer. 
 Teammate #2: Hey, that‚Äôs great. 
 Coach: I‚Äôll call your parents. 
 Foreman: Well, we still can‚Äôt release her.  We still don‚Äôt know yet exactly what‚Äôs causing the ‚Äì [A monitor beeps.]  Mary?  [Foreman looks into her eyes with his flashlight.] 
 Coach: What‚Äôs wrong?  [Mary is unresponsive and unmoving.] 
 Foreman: She‚Äôs having an absence seizure.  Mary, you okay? 
 Coach: She looks fine. 
 Foreman: I need some help over here! [to a nurse]  Push two milligrams Ativan, stat! 
 [Cut to Chase, Foreman and House in the bathroom/locker room.] 
 House: Are you sure it was an absence seizure? 
 Foreman: Absolutely.  She was totally unresponsive and unaware of what was going on around her.  [Sounds of someone groaning in a stall.  Er‚Ä¶ yeah.] 
 House: Do you mind?  We‚Äôre trying to work. 
 Chase: We should get back out there.  Cuddy‚Äôs going to be looking for us. 
 House: Looking, but not finding.  You do an EEG? 
 Foreman: Seizure frequency‚Äôs increasing.  They‚Äôre almost constant now.  5 in the last half hour. 
 House: Which tells us‚Ä¶ 
 Foreman: It‚Äôs definitely in the brain. 
 Chase: And it‚Äôs getting worse. 
 House: And?  [More groaning.]  Good lord, are you having a bowel movement or a baby? 
 Chase: Could be barbiturate withdrawal. 
 Foreman: No, can‚Äôt be dr*gs.  She‚Äôs tested at every meet she competes in. 
 House: A bleed in the brain can cause seizures. 
 Chase: Rat poison.  Could also cause the neck pain. 
 Foreman: You think she‚Äôs eating off the floor of her folks‚Äô garage? 
 House: Doesn‚Äôt have to be. 
 Foreman: Who would poison a 12-year-old? 
 House: Well, let‚Äôs see now, there‚Äôs the 18-year-old has-been that she beat out to make Nationals, the has-been‚Äôs parents, jealous siblings, sociopathic swim fan, and then there‚Äôs just your plain old garden variety whack job. [The toilet flushes, and some kid patient walks out of the stall.]  Hey!  You know what a hemorrhoid is? 
 Kid: No. 
 House: Well, google it.  And try some Raisin Bran instead of the donuts.  [He turns on the faucet with his cane.]  Okay, do a CT scan, check for intercranial bleeding. 
 Foreman: Not a chance, radiology‚Äôs totally swamped. 
 House: If our patient‚Äôs bleeding into her brain, she‚Äôs gonna be dead in 8 hours. 
 Foreman: She could be, but a meningitis patient will be without a CT scan. 
 Chase: When I was in med school, I had this old professor ‚Äì 
 House: -- who touched you in the naughty place? 
 Chase: Before the CT scan was introduced, he specialized in transcranial ultrasound. 
 House: Hmm.  Ancient, but if there‚Äôs enough bleeding it might work.  Okay, do what the guy who didn‚Äôt specialize in neurology said.  [Foreman leaves.] 
 Chase: It was my idea! 
 House: [mimics him, then] You‚Äôve still got to cover Q-Z. 
 [Cut to House entering his office, where Wilson is sitting with Doctor #2, 
 Petra Gilmar.] 
 House: Sorry I‚Äôm late, I was taking a dump. 
 Dr. Gilmar: I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm better off interviewing right after than right before. 
 Wilson: Dr. Petra Gilmar, Dr. Gregory House. 
 House: You actually speak four languages, or you just banking on never being interviewed by anyone who does?  [He takes some Vicodin.] 
 Dr. Gilmar: It‚Äôs true.  And I can swear in two more. 
 House: Why are you leaving Dr. Hazel?  Did you fall for him and can‚Äôt handle it, or is it the other way around?  [Wilson is a little shocked by the way this conversation is going.] 
 Wilson: Yes, well, pretty much every fellowship ends that way. 
 Dr. Gilmar: No, it was nothing like that. 
 House: You Jewish?  [Wilson gives him a ‚Äúhey, now!‚Äù kind of look.] 
 Dr. Gilmar: Yes. 
 House: Is it true what they say about Jewish foreplay? 
 Wilson: Uh, uh‚Ä¶ 
 Dr. Gilmar: Two hours of begging? 
 House: I heard four. 
 Dr. Gilmar: Well, actually, I‚Äôm only half-Jewish.  [Wilson and House exchange looks.]  Look, I know you like to play games with people.  I know you like to say outrageous things and study how they react.  What you should know about me is that I grew up with four brothers.  Keep your hands to yourself, I‚Äôm okay with anything that comes out of your mouth. 
 Wilson: Well, that‚Äôs great. I think that‚Äôs all we‚Äôll need.  Thank you for coming by. 
 Dr. Gilmar: Thank you.  [She shakes Wilson‚Äôs hand, and House‚Äôs.  Wilson closes the door as she leaves.] 
 Wilson: That‚Äôs our Hitler! 
 House: No way. 
 Wilson: Are you kidding?  Her background‚Äôs perfect, she‚Äôs smart, she can obviously deal with your insanity‚Ä¶ 
 House: Did you see her shoes? 
 Wilson: Her shoes?  What, did your horoscope in Vogue tell you to avoid women wearing green shoes? 
 House: The eyes can mislead, the smile can lie, but the shoes always tell the truth. 
 Wilson: They were Prada.  It means she has good taste. 
 House: They were not Prada.  You wouldn‚Äôt know Prada if one stepped on your scrotum. 
 Wilson: Okay, well, they were nice, pointy‚Ä¶ 
 House: Exactly, they were stylish, and very painful to wear.  Only an incredibly shallow and insecure woman would rather be in pain all day then wear a decent looking, comfortable shoe, and that‚Äôs exactly the type I don‚Äôt need around here. 
 Wilson: No, someone who can handle a lot of pain is exactly the type you do need. 
 [Cut to Foreman, looking through cabinets in Exam Room One for ultrasound equipment.] 
 Foreman: [to the doctor doing meningitis tests] Excuse me. 
 [Cut to Chase, still diligently researching.] 
 [Cut to Foreman, doing the ultrasound.] 
 [Cut to Chase, performing a tox screen.] 
 [Cut to Mary, waking up.] 
 Mary: What are you doing? 
 Foreman: I‚Äôm ultrasounding your head.  You‚Äôre still having seizures.  This should help us figure out what‚Äôs going on. 
 [Cut to House and Wilson doing meningitis tests and talking.] 
 House: Blue form to the security guard. 
 Wilson: You‚Äôre not going to be happy with anyone. 
 House: So what, your advice is... hire someone I‚Äôm not happy with and be happy? 
 Wilson: No, my advice is much more subtle.  Stop being an ass.  You always find some tiny little flaw to push people away. 
 House: Now it‚Äôs people.  I thought we were talking about fellowship applicants. 
 Wilson: You have a history of this. 
 House: Well, when I do decide to push you away, I hope there‚Äôs a small person kneeling behind you so you fall down and hurt your head. 
 Wilson: Take these, there‚Äôs water over there, blue form to the guard, and you‚Äôre done.  [House and Wilson walk off.]   You had the perfect person, and you blew it. 
 House: You saw the shoes! 
 Wilson: I‚Äôm not talking about her. 
 House: You‚Äôre talking about Cameron. 
 Wilson: I‚Äôm talking about every woman you‚Äôve ever given a damn about. 
 House: Cameron is so not perfect. 
 Wilson: Well, nobody‚Äôs perfect. 
 House: Mother Teresa? 
 Wilson: Dead. 
 House: Angelina Jolie? 
 Wilson: No medical degree. 
 House: Now who‚Äôs being picky? 
 Wilson: You‚Äôre going to wind up alone, House.  [Foreman and Chase walk up.] 
 Foreman: You were right, there‚Äôs a significant bleed in her temporal lobe. 
 Chase: No poisons.  Did a tox screen on her blood, urine and hair, nothing.  Did ‚Äòem twice. 
 Cuddy: [to a nurse, working on a patient]  He‚Äôs a little dehydrated, put him on a saline drip and give him some orange juice.  [House walks up.] 
 House: I need an operating room and a surgeon. 
 Cuddy: Oh, well, given the current crisis I‚Äôm tempted to say no, but since you‚Äôve been so sweet to me today ‚Äì 
 House: Our little mermaid is bleeding into her temporal lobe. 
 Cuddy: How fast can you have her prepped? 
 House: 20 minutes. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôll have a surgeon in the room in 10. 
 [Cut to the surgery, where there is drilling and such.] 
 [Cut to Foreman, going to talk to Mary‚Äôs parents, who have just arrived.] 
 Foreman: Mr. and Mrs. Carroll? 
 Mr. Carroll: Are you Dr. House? 
 Coach: This is Dr. Foreman. 
 Mr. Carroll: Is Mary all right? 
 Foreman: The operation went well.  The intercranial pressure‚Äôs been relieved and the swelling‚Äôs already going down. 
 Mr. Carroll: Thank God. 
 Mrs. Carroll: Well, what happened?  Did she bang her head at a meet, or did she 
 Coach: No, nothing like that. 
 Mrs. Carroll: Then why is she bleeding?  Is she going to be all right? 
 Foreman: We‚Äôre sorry, we still don‚Äôt know. 
 [Cut to House, staring at the white board.] 
 [Cut to the team in the Diagnostic office.] 
 Chase: No toxins, no tumor, no bone cancer. 
 Foreman: Adrenal failure could cause the rash, fever and muscle pain.  Maybe it‚Äôs some sort of genetic kidney disorder. 
 Chase: No family history, and no blood in her urine or‚Ä¶ 
 Foreman: Not yet. 
 Chase: You want to do a differential based on symptoms that might happen? 
 Foreman: Got a better idea? 
 House: Stop it.  Stop looking for things we don‚Äôt know and focus on what we do know.  What do we actually know besides what‚Äôs up there? Come on, how hard can it be to tell me what you already know? 
 Chase: She‚Äôs 12. 
 Foreman: She spends a lot of time at the pool, so exposure to chemicals. 
 Chase: She travels a lot. 
 Foreman: But never out of the country. 
 House: What else?  Come on!  [He leaves the room.] 
 [Cut to House, looking in on Mary through the wall.] 
 House: [to Chase and Foreman, who just walked up] We‚Äôre missing something. 
 Chase: What? 
 House: Well, if I knew that it wouldn‚Äôt be missing. 
 Chase: Maybe she‚Äôs adopted and we‚Äôve got the wrong history. 
 House: No, she‚Äôs got her mom‚Äôs eyes and a red patch of hair just like dad. 
 Foreman: What about an allergic reaction? 
 Chase: Could explain the rash and muscle pain, but not the bleeding or seizures. 
 House: That‚Äôs a lot of balloons. 
 Chase: Think she‚Äôs allergic to polyester? 
 House: Not unless she‚Äôs been competing in the nude all these years. 
 Chase: Then what are you thinking?  What do the balloons mean? 
 House: What if the rash isn‚Äôt a rash? 
 Foreman: What are you talking about? 
 House: Who gave her the balloons? 
 Foreman: Some of the girls from her team.  They‚Äôve been visiting her pretty regularly, but none of them are sick. 
 House: What about the guys? 
 Foreman: None of them are sick either. 
 House: Which guys visited her? 
 Foreman: Actually, none. 
 House: She‚Äôs cute, she‚Äôs nice, she‚Äôs a kick-ass diver.  You‚Äôd think the guys would be falling over themselves to get close to her. 
 Foreman: She‚Äôs 12.  The youngest guy on her team is 16. 
 House: Okay, so maybe they‚Äôre just not interested.  Or‚Ä¶ 
 Chase: They‚Äôre avoiding her. 
 House: There any cell fragments in her blood smears? 
 Chase: No, red blood cells were intact. 
 House: Check ‚Äòem again. 
 [Cut to Chase and Foreman looking at the blood in the lab.  The cells are very cut up.] 
 Chase: Blood looks like it‚Äôs been put through the blender, now.  [House enters.] 
 House: You done yet? 
 Foreman: You were right.  Rash wasn‚Äôt a rash, she‚Äôs bleeding into her skin. It‚Äôs purpura. 
 Chase: Thrombocytopenia purpura? 
 House: Starts with T.  You were so close. 
 Foreman: What could have set it off?  She had no trace of E. Coli in her cultures, she‚Äôs obviously not menopausal, so no estrogen. 
 House: There is one other possible cause. 
 Chase: Oh, God. 
 [Cut to House, doing an ultrasound on Mary‚Äôs abdomen.] 
 House: Pregnancy cause all kinds of chemical and biological changes in a woman‚Äôs body.  Or a girl‚Äôs body, as the case may be.  [He moves the screen so she can see the fetus.]  In extremely rare cases, everything goes haywire.  It‚Äôs called TTP.  Blood starts clotting like crazy, clogs the vessels in your brain and kidneys.  Red blood cells end up getting shredded as they squeeze past the clot like a fat guy in a crowed bar. I‚Äôm sure you know what that‚Äôs like.  You‚Äôre only 12, but you‚Äôre all grown up, right?  [He offers her tissues.]  Travel on your own, hang out in hotel rooms getting room service with your teammates, maybe someone sneaks in a couple of beers, you start playing spin the bottle‚Ä¶ next thing you know you‚Äôre waking up in nothing but your socks. 
 Mary: It wasn‚Äôt like that. 
 House: Of course not.  You wanted it. 
 Mary: Yeah, I did.  He turned out to be a jerk, but‚Ä¶ 
 House: Actually, under New Jersey law the term is ‚Äòfelon.‚Äô 
 Mary: I knew what I was doing. 
 House: We‚Äôre going to have to do something called plasmapheresis.  It cleans the antibodies from your blood.  We‚Äôre also going to have to terminate the pregnancy. 
 Mary: You‚Äôre going to tell my parents? 
 House: Someone should.  Rock paper scissors? 
 Mary: They don‚Äôt need to know.  I‚Äôll be all right. 
 House: Of course you will.  If you‚Äôre old enough to bleed out of your vag*na, obviously you‚Äôre old enough to handle a simple thing like an abortion without Mommy and Daddy‚Äôs help. 
 Mary: You‚Äôre going to tell my parents? 
 House: Under New Jersey law, you‚Äôre the boss. 
 [Cut to House walking to the Carrolls.] 
 House: Your daughter has TTP.  Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs curable, she‚Äôll be fine. 
 Mrs. Carroll: Well, wait!  What does TTP stand for? 
 House: Some really big words that you‚Äôve never heard before and when we‚Äôre done we‚Äôll never hear again.  Have a nice day. 
 Mr. Carroll: Well, when can we take her home? 
 House: Uh, in a few days.  She needs some minor surgery to remove the underlying cause before we can do the‚Ä¶ another really big word. 
 Mr. Carroll: What‚Äôs the underlying cause? 
 House: She has an abnormal growth in her abdomen. 
 Mrs. Carroll: What kind of surgery? 
 House: It‚Äôs very simple.  We do it here all the time. 
 Mr. Carroll: Could you be a little more specific? 
 House: Actually, no.  I‚Äôm sorry. 
 [Cut to Mary, having the abortion.  We can see tears rolling down her cheeks.] 
 [Cut to Mary‚Äôs room, where Foreman and Chase are taking away IVs and such.] 
 Chase: You‚Äôre doing good. 
 Foreman: Feeling okay? 
 Mary: Yeah. 
 Chase: You should be, your platelet count‚Äôs up. 
 Foreman: How‚Äôs your neck?  [Mary moves it around.]  Looks good.  Anything else we can get you? 
 Mary: No thanks. 
 Foreman: Okay.  [They start to leave.] 
 Mary: Yeah.  [They turn.]  Can I see my mom and dad? 
 [Cut to House watching Mary as she tells her parents what happened.  Mary breaks down, and her mother gives her a hug.] 
 Chase: [walking up] Plasmapheresis is working, she‚Äôs going to be fine. 
 House: I know. 
 [Cut to the hospital staff cleaning up.  The epidemic is over.] 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs office, where he is sitting with Wilson and Doctor #3, Arlene Marks.  No one is talking.] 
 Dr. Marks: I can‚Äôt even tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you.  [And House‚Ä¶ remains silent.]  The moment I heard you had another fellowship opening, I ‚Äì 
 House: There is no opening. 
 Wilson: House, you have to hire someone. 
 House: I know.  The position‚Äôs been filled. 
 Dr. Marks: Why am I interviewing for a position that‚Äôs already been filled? 
 House: Exactly.  [He gets up to leave.] 
 Dr. Marks: I called to confirm the interview this morning. 
 House: You figure if you keep arguing I‚Äôm going to cave, admit it‚Äôs all a lie, and hire you?  [He leaves.] 
 Wilson: Do you need your parking validated? 
 [Cut to Cameron‚Äôs apartment, and I swear the walls still look eerily similar.  Weeeeeird.  There‚Äôs a knocking at her chamber door, and she goes to answer.] 
 House: I don‚Äôt want to interview anyone else. 
 Cameron: You‚Äôre interviewing?  I thought you‚Äôd just have them send a headshot along with their CV. 
 House: Hah.  That‚Äôs good.  And why I need you around.  To keep me in my place.  [He keeps trying to look into Cameron‚Äôs apartment.  Heh.] 
 Cameron: I can‚Äôt come back, I told you that. 
 House: Wasn‚Äôt listening. 
 Cameron: Right. 
 House: You want me to listen to you more?  I can do that. 
 Cameron: Right.  I already accepted a position somewhere else. 
 House: With who? 
 Cameron: Yule, at Jefferson. 
 House: Unaccept it. 
 Cameron: Why? 
 House: Because Yule is boring.  He‚Äôs pedantic and preachy.  Because he‚Äôs short.  Because I want you to come back. 
 Cameron: Not good enough. 
 House: Want more money?  A car allowance, better parking space? 
 Cameron: Dinner.  And not just a meal between two colleagues.  A date. 
 House: You‚Äôll come back to work if I go out on a date with you? 
 Cameron: Yes. 
 House: Okay, it‚Äôs a deal.  [They shake on it.] 
 Cameron: See you tomorrow morning. 
 House: Don‚Äôt be late. 
 Cameron: I won‚Äôt.

 HOUSE: I just said... 
 CUDDY: You were lying. 
 HOUSE: Then why'd you ask? 
 CUDDY: Because if you told the truth, I was gonna give you only one day of clinic duty. 
 HOUSE: That's dishonest. In refuse to participate in this... 
 CUDDY: [firm] You'll do it. You owe me. [smugly] I kept you out of jail, I can put you back. 
 [House knows he's beaten. He starts to leave.] 
 HOUSE: [over his shoulder] Perjurer. 
 CUDDY: [right back at ya] Felon. 
 [House exits.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room Two. House enters. An African-American man (AKA ""Runny-nose Guy"") is inside.] 
 HOUSE: How can I help you this beautiful morning? 
 RUNNY-NOSE GUY: I-I told the nurse I have a runny nose... but I don't. I think I have, uh, syphilis or gonorrhea. 
 [The camera pans across House's back, as we...] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room Three. Speaking to House now is a twenty-something attractive lady, who seems upset.] 
 LADY (EVE): I think I have an STD. 
 [Clinic, Exam Room One. House turns around to face his next patient - a woman (AKA ""Bashful Old Lady"") in her late sixties.] 
 BASHFUL OLD LADY: I think I have a... [points downwards] 
 [House says nothing. Expressionlessly, he reaches for the rubber glove dispenser. He pulls out one, then two, then thinks it wise to pull out one more.] 
 [Nurse's Station/Clinic Waiting Room. House limps over to the station, holding a swab (of what is anyone's guess) at arm's length in disgust. He drops it on the counter for the nurse to handle. He moves over to the waiting room and addresses the ""sick people"".] 
 HOUSE: Who is here for a runny nose? 
 [A few people raise their hands.] 
 HOUSE: It's a cold! It'll get better. Go home! 
 [The ""runny-nose"" people leave.] 
 HOUSE: Those of you who have stayed obviously do not have colds. 
 [As House speaks, one of the patients (AKA ""Ear Guy"") is scratching his right ear a bit too hard. Cuddy comes out of her office, having heard House's tirade.] 
 HOUSE: You'll be assigned a doctor, who is not me, 'cause I'm tired of wiping crotches. 
 CUDDY: [striding up to House] House! You're doing this. 
 [House is about to plead his case, when suddenly Ear Guy jumps up screaming to high heaven, clutching his right ear, giving everyone a start. Clutching his head in his hands (like it's about to explode), he starts to run ""agony laps"" around the nurse's station in agony.] 
 EAR GUY: [screaming] It hurts! 
 NURSE: [trying to calm him down] Sir... 
 [The nurse tries to stop him, but he keeps running, still screaming bloody m*rder. Cuddy has no luck in stopping him. She looks at House. House only watches with interest as the guy runs another agony lap.] 
 CUDDY: [to nurse] Call security. 
 [House limps over to the pharmacy, just as Ear Guy makes another lap.] 
 PHARMACIST (MARKO): Should I get a sedative? 
 HOUSE: No, I'm good, thanks. 
 [Ear Guy, still screaming, is about to finish another lap. Marko goes to get the sedative, regardless of how House feels. Cuddy looks afraid. House picks out for a syringe from the pharmacy.] 
 EAR GUY: [high-pitched] Head on fire!! 
 [House swings his cane in front of Ear Guy, tripping him, dropping him to the floor, where he continues to scream and writhe in agony. House goes up to him with the syringe, tossing Cuddy his cane. He jabs his knee into the man's ribs to keep him steady. He pulls out the syringe cap with his teeth and sticks the syringe into the guy's behind. The screaming and writhing stop almost immediately. Cuddy kneels down to check on the guy. When she turns him over, she sees his face is still contorted with agony.] 
 HOUSE: [calling] Need a team here! 
 MARKO: I have the sedative! 
 CUDDY: Little late. 
 HOUSE: [taking the sedative] Just in time. 
 CUDDY: What did you give him? 
 HOUSE: Paralytic. 
 CUDDY: Why would you do that?! 
 HOUSE: Somebody had to stop the screaming. 
 CUDDY: Then he's still in pain. 
 [House injects the sedative in the guy's arm.] 
 HOUSE: Yeah! But quietly. 
 [A team comes up with a stretcher.] 
 HOUSE: [to them] Paralytic stopped him breathing. He goes hypoxic, he's gonna be quiet forever. 
 [Cuddy and House move out of the way, as the emergency medics go to work on Ear Guy. House limps up to a quietly-seething Cuddy.] 
 HOUSE: So, either I can continue to swab people's privates, or I can figure out if this guy's delirium, pain and insanely high heart-rate are life-threatening or just a personality quirk. 
 [Cuddy gives him a resigned look.] 
 HOUSE: I think the latter choice is better for all three of us. 
 [Ear Guy's room. He's hooked up to life-support and awake.] 
 FOREMAN: [vo] He's sedated. It took five cc's of haliperidol to get him down after the paralytic wore off. 
 [Diagnostics office. House confers with the Ducklings on Ear Guy's case.] 
 HOUSE: So, pain in his right ear, psychotic behaviour and dizziness. Go! 
 CHASE: Nurses said he was holding his head. How d'you know it was specifically his ear? 
 HOUSE: Because he was dizzy. Means the problem was affecting his inner ear. 
 CAMERON: Nurses said he was running in circles. Doesn't mean he was dizzy. 
 HOUSE: He wasn't running in circles. He was running in oblongs. Looked like a three-year-old kid drew them. 
 FOREMAN: Acoustic Neuroma that started a haemorrhage. 
 HOUSE: 'Splains the pain, vertigo, everything. Get an MRI. 
 [Foreman looks victorious. Cameron shrugs. They get up to go.] 
 HOUSE: What else? 
 [They sit down, unsurely.] 
 FOREMAN: If it explains everything, what...? 
 HOUSE: It might not explain everything. 
 CHASE: What if he was psychotic first? Then self-mutilated, damaged the ear. 
 HOUSE: Excellent. Need a complete psychiatric work-up. 
 [They get up to go.] 
 HOUSE: [to Cameron] Your turn. 
 CAMERON: Uhh, I was... gonna say what Foreman... 
 HOUSE: Well, say something else. 
 CAMERON: [opening the file] He... came to the clinic. 
 HOUSE: [patronizing] Goood... 
 CAMERON: [bit more confident] Decent chance he had a chronic illness first, 'specially given the rapid heart rate. 
 [Foreman raises a skeptical eyebrow.] 
 HOUSE: [seems impressed] Hmm. 
 CAMERON: [even more confident] Lingering ear infection. Pressure builds up in his inner ear, bursts through the mastoid bone while he's waiting in the clinic. 
 HOUSE: [almost imitating an orgasm] Ohhh, yes! Get a head CT, draw a blood culture, run a chem panel and get a 
 complete blood count. 
 [They start to leave. House moves towards his office.] 
 HOUSE: Oh, while you're at it, pour some alcohol into his ear and take out the cockroach. 
 [The Ducklings look nonplussed.] 
 FOREMAN: He has a cockroach in his ear? 
 HOUSE: [collecting his coat from his office] He was scratching that ear right before the event, so I took a peek. My guess is, it started biting. 
 CAMERON: [wearily] Nothing else wrong with him? 
 HOUSE: Wasn't that enough? Pretty gross. 
 CHASE: So, why are we doing the tests? 
 HOUSE: Well, it's either that or I have to keep doing clinic duty. Do the tests or just stay out of Cuddy's sight, I don't really care which. 
 [Foreman and Chase leave, while Cameron tosses the file back onto the table.] 
 [Jogging park. House sits on a picnic table. The extracted pea-sized bug skitters across his hand, as he blows gently on it. Wilson approaches.] 
 WILSON: Why are you here? 
 HOUSE: [shooing away the bug] Because it's not a hospital. 
 WILSON: It's a jogging park. You're not jogging. You can't jog. 
 HOUSE: Watching jogging. I sit, I watch, I imagine. 
 [With a slight smile, Wilson sits on the table next to House.] 
 WILSON: So... what do you watch for? 
 HOUSE: [motioning] That guy's running in shorts. 
 [Wilson turns to see the guy ""jogging"" past two female joggers.] 
 WILSON: He's not jogging, he's trolling. 
 HOUSE: [smiles in approval] You're good at this. 
 WILSON: How long are you goin' to stay here? 
 HOUSE: Beauty of this place is that it's the last place Cuddy will look. 
 [Wilson smiles and nods.] 
 [PPTH. Clinic, Exam Room. A balding shabby-looking homeless old man sits on the table. Cameron enters cheerily.] 
 CAMERON: How can I help you? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: The doctors gave me this. [produces a note] 
 CAMERON: [taking the note] What doctors? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: At the other hospital. Last month. 
 [Cameron peruses the paper. She then looks up somberly at him.] 
 CAMERON: [gently] Do you know what this is? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Yes. 
 CAMERON: [reading] ""Patient has a six centimetre mass in the right lung. Cancerous. Inoperable."" Do you understand what this means? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Is it okay if I sleep here tonight? 
 [Cameron looks at him, sympathetically.] 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: It's cold outside. 
 [Outside Exam Room/Nurse's Station. Cameron walks outside, feeling a bit morose. She walks over to the nurse's station. Cuddy, at the station, sees her.] 
 CUDDY: What're you doing here? Thought House had a case. 
 CAMERON: He doesn't. 
 [Jogging park. House lies spread out on the picnic table (almost resembling Christ on the Crucifix). Cuddy walks up and leans over him, looking directly at him.] 
 CUDDY: You ordered a CT on a patient with a bug in his ear? 
 HOUSE: How'd you know I was here? 
 CUDDY: Ran into Cameron in the clinic. 
 HOUSE: [getting up] ""Ran into""? 
 CUDDY: You ordered pointless tests just to... 
 HOUSE: Wouldn't've been pointless if you didn't ""run into"" Cameron. 
 CUDDY: She got punished. She's stuck with another dying patient. 
 [House pops a pill.] 
 CUDDY: [what the...!] Is that Vicodin? 
 HOUSE: Breath mint. Thought you were gonna kiss me. 
 CUDDY: What happened to rehab? 
 HOUSE: I got out. 
 CUDDY: [understanding, sighing in exasperation] It was a scam? 
 HOUSE: Enough foreplay. You gonna kiss me or not? 
 CUDDY: You are going back to the clinic. Or jail. 
 HOUSE: [amused] You perjured yourself to keep me out of jail. How're you...? 
 CUDDY: I only did that because I thought you were getting clean. 
 HOUSE: So it's do clinic duty or go to jail. 
 CUDDY: Yes. 
 HOUSE: Then it'll be finish your paperwork or go to jail. Help with fundraising or go to jail. Do your job or go to jail. I think I'd rather go to jail. 
 [He grabs his cane and gets off the table, walking past Cuddy.] 
 CUDDY: [turning to him] You owe me. 
 [House looks at her; she gives him a smug look. House relents.] 
 [PPTH. Clinic, Exam Room.] 
 [POV: Patient's (AKA ""Sherlock Nose"") nostril. House looks through an otoscope at the screen.] 
 HOUSE: Bea-utiful. 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: Thank you. It's dry. 
 HOUSE: Who cares. It's beautiful. 
 [Camera moves from the nostril into the exam room. House rolls his chair to the table to change the lens on the otoscope.] 
 HOUSE: If my lawn was half as well maintained as that, pigeons wouldn't have the nerve to poop on it. 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: Good grooming is important. 
 HOUSE: Is that a shot? 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: [calm and collected] People do judge you on your appearance. 
 [House rolls the chair back to Mr. Nose.] 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: When you entered, I noted your shirt hadn't been pressed; you hadn't shaved in quite some time. 
 [House looks into his nose using the otoscope.] 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: I extrapolated you were a person for whom detail is not a major concern. I was worried you might apply the same standard in your work. 
 HOUSE: [interrupting] You use toe-nail clippers up there? 
 SHERLOCK NOSE: They're longer, so they allow me to better reach the upper hairs. 
 HOUSE: I am wearing a rumpled shirt, and I forgot to brush my hair this week. You've got athlete's foot in your 
 nose. 
 [Sherlock seems appalled. He moves his hand to his nose, but self-consciously puts it back down.] 
 HOUSE: [coolly] I'm ready to be judged. 
 [Waiting area. Cuddy's at the pharmacy. House slaps a file on the counter and addresses the ""sick people"" again.] 
 HOUSE: Okay! Fifty dollars...! 
 [Cuddy turns around to look at House.] 
 HOUSE: ...to any patient who's willing to leave here right now. 
 [Cuddy has a bewildered look on her face. An African-American man (AKA ""Fifty-buck Dad"") seems interested. He motions to his bespectacled eight-year-old kid (AKA ""Fifty-buck Son"").] 
 DAD: Get your stuff. 
 CUDDY: House! You can't... 
 HOUSE: My money. 
 CUDDY: I don't care. People do not... 
 HOUSE: [handing over $50 to the dad] They leave, fifty bucks. They're not all that sick. [looks at the people] 
 [Dad and son leave.] 
 CUDDY: Or they're poor. 
 [House gets rid of another patient.] 
 CUDDY: And desperate. Which was why this place is here. 
 HOUSE: If they're that poor, then they'd rather have fifty bucks. 
 [A well-dressed old guy walks up, coughing into his handkerchief.] 
 OLD GUY: [hoarsely] Can I have the money? 
 [House grabs the old guy's hand, which holds the kerchief, to show Cuddy. The kerchief is monogrammed ""DS"" and has a small blood stain near the monogram.] 
 HOUSE: Look. It's monogrammed. He doesn't need money. Ergo, he's not sick. 
 CUDDY: And the blood? 
 HOUSE: [shrugging it off] Could be anybody's. Monogram's definitely his. 
 [House hands him the fifty bucks. The old guy leaves happily.] 
 CUDDY: [smiling (for the sake of appearances)] We need to talk. 
 [They walk towards her office.] 
 [Cuddy's Office. Cuddy opens the door, followed by House.] 
 HOUSE: [melodramatically] Doesn't matter what you say, do or thr*aten. I will find a way out. 
 CUDDY: How can we make this more interesting for you? 
 HOUSE: How can we make the sky green? How can we make the tall short? You cannot make the uninteresting interesting. 
 CUDDY: [with a crooked smile, enticing] I'll pay you ten dollars for every patient you diagnose without touching. 
 [House is definitely intrigued.] 
 CUDDY: You pay me ten dollars for everyone you have to touch. 
 HOUSE: You're making this into a game for me. From which I can only conclude this isn't a game for you. 
 CUDDY: No. 
 HOUSE: Why? Think if I deal with enough people, I'll find some humanity? 
 CUDDY: Yes. 
 [And so it begins. The following montage is filmed using a handheld camera.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. A patient (AKA ""Tongue Guy"") is pressing his tongue down himself, with a tongue depressor. House sits in front of him, looking down his throat.] 
 TONGUE GUY: Wha' ah ha' todo 'is mahsulf? (Why do I have to do this myself?) 
 HOUSE: I got a bum leg. Say ""Aah"". 
 TONGUE GUY: Aaahhh-aahh. 
 [House grimaces as he looks into his throat.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. A lady (AKA ""Stomach Lady"") sleeps on the table, her shirt pulled up to her midriff. She feels the area around the solar plexus. House sits nearby (no touching!).] 
 STOMACH LADY: Feels rough. 
 HOUSE: Yes! It's a rash. Can't get any more than ""rough"". 
 STOMACH LADY: [exasperated to have to do it herself] Well, [mutters] it's just rough. Can't you feel it? 
 HOUSE: Well, I could. But then, what satisfaction would you get? 
 [She keeps rubbing her solar plexus.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. A teenage patient (AKA ""Pulse Dude"") sits on the table, trying to find a pulse on his left arm.] 
 PULSE DUDE: Got it. 
 HOUSE: [checking his watch] Start counting. 
 [Pulse Dude starts counting mentally.] 
 HOUSE: [two seconds later] How many? 
 PULSE DUDE: T-twenty six. 
 [House, astonished, mouths the word ""twenty"", closes his eyes and purses his lips.] 
 HOUSE: Okay. Either you suck at math, or you're gonna die in two seconds. [waits a couple of seconds mock-expectantly] You suck at math. 
 [Nurse's station/Clinic. House limps to the station, file in hand. Cuddy's there, signing something.] 
 HOUSE: Diagnosis! [slaps the file down, picks up another] Prescription! [to Cuddy] You owe me thirty. 
 [Cuddy smiles in the background. House limps to the Exam Room One. He opens the door to find a really attractive lady sitting there (might I add, wearing a low-cut dress!). She smiles at House and waits expectantly. House closes the door, with a dubious expression on his face.] 
 [Nurse's station. House approaches Cuddy from behind.] 
 HOUSE: I owe you ten. 
 [Cuddy smiles, giving him a ""I-guessed-as-much"" look.] 
 CUDDY: [holding up a file] Test results are back for your STD patients. I'm not paying you for them. You already touched them. 
 [House considers it and limps off.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. House slaps the file on to a cart. Runny-nose Guy is back.] 
 HOUSE: How old are you? 
 RUNNY-NOSE GUY: Thirty. 
 HOUSE: And you've never seen an after-school special? Dawson's Creek? How do you get to thirty and not know about condoms? 
 RUNNY-NOSE GUY: [rattled] Oh God, I h... I have an STD. 
 HOUSE: No. But you will. Every patient who comes in here for an STD test has one thing in common. They had SWS. ""Sex While Stupid"". 
 [The camera pans across quickly as we...] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. House testily addresses Bashful Old Lady.] 
 HOUSE: [fatigued] How old are you? 
 BASHFUL OLD LADY: [looking down] Sixty. 
 HOUSE: [looks up in disbelief] You're lying. That's not the point. You've never seen Dawson's Creek? 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. House now speaks to Eve, who still seems upset.] 
 [TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE: Just so y'all know, Eve is upset throughout the episode. So I'm not going to write ""EVE: [upset] yada yada"" every time she speaks.] 
 HOUSE: And you've never seen an after-school special? How do you get to your age and not know about condoms? 
 EVE: I have an STD? 
 HOUSE: Yeah! You're actually the first one today. Lucky day. Not for you, but gotta feel good for everyone else. 
 [Eve drops her head and breaks down. She sobs loudly. House turns around.] 
 HOUSE: It's Chlamydia. As bad news goes, 's about the best. 
 [That doesn't seem to reassure her. She continues weeping quietly.] 
 HOUSE: Oh, settle down. It's treatable. It's actually curable. 
 [No effect. She seems to be getting even more worked up. House puts a couple of pills in a plastic cup.] 
 HOUSE: [no idea what to do] All you have to do is take these pills... 
 [He holds the plastic cup in front of her. Suddenly, she lashes out, almost savagely, knocking the cup and pills out of House's hand.] 
 EVE: DON'T TOUCH ME!! 
 [She glares at House. House looks at her and understands.] 
 HOUSE: [quietly] Oh God. 
 [Eve slows lowers her head.] 
 [Cuddy's office. Cuddy's at her desk. House enters.] 
 HOUSE: [seriously] I need someone to cover a patient. 
 CUDDY: House, you're committed to... 
 HOUSE: She was r*ped. [beat] Think I'm the right doctor for her? 
 [Aerial shot of PPTH. Day.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. Cuddy speaks with Eve, who sits huddled up on the table.] 
 CUDDY: We've assigned another doctor to your care. 
 EVE: I didn't mean to upset Dr. House. 
 CUDDY: He knows that. That's not why we're doing this. 
 EVE: I'd like to keep being treated by him. 
 CUDDY: [huh?] W-Why? 
 EVE: Just do. 
 CUDDY: Trust me, it's better if you deal with somebody who specialises... 
 EVE: I'm fine. 
 CUDDY: You told Dr. House it's been less than a week. You haven't told anyone other than him. Emotionally, you're still... 
 EVE: [getting mad] You know what I'm dealing with? You know what I'm going through? 
 CUDDY: [quietly] No. You think Dr. House does? [beat] I'm not suggesting either one of us be your doctor. Dr. Stone is psychiatri... 
 EVE: [resolute] If Dr. House is too busy, I could wait. 
 [Cuddy looks at her, resigned.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. Eve leans up against a wall. House sits on a stool at the other end of the room.] 
 HOUSE: Why do you want me? 
 EVE: I don't know. 
 HOUSE: [shrugging] I don't wanna treat you. 
 EVE: You're just saying that so I'll see the psychiatrist. 
 HOUSE: True. 'Cept for the word ""just"". I'm saying, I don't wanna treat you so you'll see the psychiatrist _and_because I don't wanna treat you. 
 [She walks forward and leans on the table, looking at him.] 
 EVE: Why don't you wanna treat me anymore? 
 HOUSE: I never wanted to treat you. Fact that you were r*ped [beat, sighs] holds no interest for me. It's nothing personal. There's nothing to treat. You're physically healthy. 
 EVE: [purses her lips] Okay. 
 [House nods and gets up to leave.] 
 EVE: [persistent] But I want you to be my doctor. 
 HOUSE: [turns] Why? 
 EVE: [shakes her head] I don't know. 
 HOUSE: You gotta have a reason. Everything has a reason. 
 EVE: I trust you. 
 HOUSE: Ah, see, that's a bad reason. 'Cause I'll lie to you. I'll tell you anything just to get you out of here. 
 EVE: I don't care. I wanna talk to you. 
 HOUSE: [lowers his head, moves towards her] Look, you were r*ped. All control was taken away from you. You're trying to find that control again. You want me because I don't want you. 
 EVE: [pissed] I'm raping you? 
 HOUSE: In a very non-invasive, more annoying than trauma... 
 EVE: [yelling] Get the hell out of here! 
 HOUSE: I'll send in Dr. Stone. 
 [He opens the door, looks at her and leaves.] 
 [Homeless Old Guy's Room. The man is in a bed, hooked up to monitors and IV lines. Cameron enters.] 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: [drawling] I didn't consent to all this medicine. 
 CAMERON: You've been out on the streets. No treatment... 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: I'm dying, there's no treatment for dying. 
 CAMERON: We can make you comfortable. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Don't wanna be. 
 CAMERON: Why not? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Because I screwed up my life. 
 CAMERON: So you wanna punish yourself for messing up my life? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: [appealing] Please, stop the treatment. 
 [Cameron looks at him.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. House is now attending to a new patient - a guy with hiccups (AKA ""Hiccup Guy"").] 
 HOUSE: It'll go away on it's own. 
 HICCUP GUY: It's not can... [hic] 
 HOUSE: No, it'll go away. 
 HICCUP GUY: [hoarse] It's been all day. There must be some treatment you... 
 HOUSE: Nope! It'll go away. 
 HICCUP GUY: [hic] 
 HOUSE: Or... it won't go away. [starts to leave] 
 HICCUP GUY: I read about a treatment. 
 [House turns at the door, irritably.] 
 HICCUP GUY: Some guy won a prize for it. 
 [House looks at him suspiciously - yeah, they give Nobel Prizes for curing hiccups.] 
 HICCUP GUY: I read about it. 
 HOUSE: You don't have the hiccups, do you? 
 HICCUP GUY: [opens his mouth a bit and simulates a hiccup sheepishly] 
 [Nurse's station. House slams the Hiccup Guy's file on the counter. Cuddy approaches.] 
 HOUSE: [to the nurse] Make a note. Drug-seeking behaviour. 
 CUDDY: Morphine? 
 HOUSE: No! a**l-digital stimulation. 
 [He turns and sees Eve speaking with Dr. Stone in another room.] 
 HOUSE: How long has Stone been in with her? 
 CUDDY: Are you concerned? 
 HOUSE: You know how many people get r*ped everyday? 
 CUDDY: So it's common, therefore boring. 
 HOUSE: We were to care for every person suffering on the planet, life would shut down. 
 CUDDY: How 'bout just the ones we meet? 
 HOUSE: They deserve our sympathy more than the other people? 
 CUDDY: So your solution is not to give a damn about any of them? How do you do that? How do you take that theory and put it in practice? You met her... 
 [House looks over her shoulder and sees something.] 
 HOUSE: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa! 
 [He runs off-screen. Cuddy looks behind in bewilderment.] 
 [PPTH Lobby. It's the same father-son duo (Fifty-buck Dad and Son). The son is on a wheelchair, being wheeled in by a doctor. Dad is by his side. House limps over to them.] 
 HOUSE: Hey! [to the doctor] I paid these people fifty bucks to leave here an hour ago. 
 FIFTY-BUCK DAD: Yeah, we came back. 
 [The doctor seems puzzled.] 
 HOUSE: Then you owe fifty. 
 DOCTOR: The kid needs surgery. 
 HOUSE: [skeptically] And he could walk way back then. [to the son] Stand up, kid. 
 [The son stands.] 
 DOCTOR: He swallowed a magnet. We gotta cut it out. 
 HOUSE: How old are you? 
 FIFTY-BUCK SON: Eight. 
 HOUSE: And he swallowed something stuck to a fridge? Darwin says let him die. 
 [The dad gives him a WTF look.] 
 HOUSE: It's already below the stomach. It should pass on its own. 
 DOCTOR: Strong magnet. It's messing with the imaging. We have no way to... 
 [House kneels in front of the son and lifts up the kid's shirt, exposing his stomach.] 
 DOCTOR: Got X-ray vision, House? 
 [House thinks a bit, then reaches over and pulls out a scalpel. He removes the protective cover with his teeth.] 
 FIFTY-BUCK DAD: [scared] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You gonna cut him open? Right here? 
 [House doesn't incise, he just moves the scalpel slowly in front of the boy's stomach, near the belly-button. The dad starts freaking out. The doctor bends over to look. The scalpel sticks to the boy's stomach, left of his belly-button. The dad and the doctor look relieved.] 
 HOUSE: It's well into the intestines. He's fine. [takes the scalpel and stands] I want my fifty back. 
 [The dad starts rummaging through his pockets, when a shout is heard.] 
 DR. STONE: I need a crash cart! Stat! 
 [House turns.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. Eve lies on the floor, convulsing. Dr. Stone kneels down to check up on her.] 
 [Clinic. House limp/runs into the clinic.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. Cuddy comes running inside.] 
 [Clinic. House is nearing the exam room.] 
 [Clinic, Exam Room. Eve is foaming at the mouth. She's unconscious, yet convulsing. Cuddy kneels down beside her. House enters.] 
 HOUSE: What happened? 
 DR. STONE: Pills. Benzos. We need to get her stomach pumped. 
 CUDDY: Breastplate sounds shallow. 
 HOUSE: [to Dr. Stone] What did you say to her? 
 DR. STONE: [defensively] Nothing that would make her want to... 
 CUDDY: Heartbeat's irregular! 
 HOUSE: What did she say to you? 
 DR. STONE: Nothing. I gave her a couple sedatives, turned around, she grabbed the whole bottle. 
 [The emergency team starts to intubate.] 
 HOUSE: You must have said something. 
 DR. STONE: I said plenty, she said nothing. I was with her for over an hour. She didn't say one word. 
 [House watches as the emergency team works on Eve.] 
 [Eve's room. She's asleep. Her hands are tied to the bed. House sits nearby, playing on his PSP. Eve wakes up. She sees House. She tries to raise her arm, but finds it tied to the bed. She drops her arms in frustration. House notices the movement. Keeping the PSP aside, he goes over to her and checks her pulse.] 
 HOUSE: You gonna do that again? 
 [She slowly shakes her head. He unstraps the binds around her left wrist.] 
 HOUSE: You're gonna be okay... physically. 
 EVE: Which is all that interests you. 
 [He goes over and undoes the bind on her right wrist. He looks at her.] 
 EVE: You're here. 
 HOUSE: Under orders. 
 EVE: Why would you tell me that? 
 HOUSE: 'Cause I don't like hypocrisy. 
 EVE: But you don't have a problem with cruelty? 
 [House shines a flashlight in her eye to check up on her. Satisfied, he pockets the flashlight.] 
 HOUSE: Which brings us back to, why do you want me? 
 EVE: I don't know. 
 HOUSE: Tried to k*ll yourself 'cause you couldn't talk to me. Must have a reason. 
 EVE: [quietly] Why's there always have to be a reason? Can't we just talk? 
 HOUSE: [getting annoyed] There's a phone. Talk to a friend. Family-member. Call the police. 
 [She sighs and turns her head away.] 
 HOUSE: [sighs in defeat] You wanna talk about what happened to you? 
 EVE: No. 
 HOUSE: [sitting on a stool] Talk about your STD meds? 
 EVE: No. 
 HOUSE: You don't really seem to wanna talk. 
 EVE: No, I do. 
 HOUSE: 'Bout what? 
 EVE: I don't know. Anything. 
 HOUSE: The weather? 
 [She seems to agree with that subject.] 
 HOUSE: You were r*ped and you want to talk about the weather? 
 EVE: [nods] Yeah. 
 HOUSE: [getting up in exasperation] I'm not gonna talk to you about the weather. 
 [He limps over to her and straps the binds around her wrists again. She turns her head away.] 
 [Diagnostics office. A really flustered House speaks to the Ducklings, while pouring himself some coffee.] 
 HOUSE: [to Cameron] You'll help her! 
 CAMERON: She wants you. 
 FOREMAN: God knows why. 
 HOUSE: She doesn't know what she wants. 
 CAMERON: She knows she wants you. You're the first person she spoke to about this. 
 HOUSE: Fact that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, should be trumped by the fact that I'm useless at 
 this. 
 CAMERON: No, you're not. 
 CHASE: [to Cameron] You romantically wanting to believe that is never gonna make it true. 
 [House glares at him.] 
 CHASE: [defensively] I'm agreeing with you. You're the last person she should be talking to. 
 FOREMAN: She wants to talk about the weather, talk about the weather. She wants normalcy. She wants to feel like the world didn't end. 
 HOUSE: Right. I'll tell her that everything went on without her. Babies were born, people got married. Thousands of people will remember the day she got r*ped as the happiest day of their lives. 
 FOREMAN: You might not wanna phrase it quite that way. 
 CAMERON: You need to get her to talk about what happened. 
 FOREMAN: No, he doesn't. 
 CAMERON: [to Foreman] Pretending it didn't happen... 
 FOREMAN: Wrong! Pretending this didn't happen is the best thing she could possibly do. 
 CAMERON: [to House, firmly] She's gotta make this real. 
 FOREMAN: You know what we should be trying to make real or process? The few decent moments in our lives, not the crap. 
 CAMERON: [getting mad] Maybe you're right! Except there's no way she can pretend this didn't happen, so she has no choice but to process it. 
 [House considers this.] 
 [Eve's room. House busts in.] 
 HOUSE: You gotta tell me what happened. 
 EVE: You don't really wanna hear. 
 HOUSE: [undoing her binds] Sure I do. 
 EVE: You're lying. 
 HOUSE: Doesn't have to destroy your life. 
 EVE: I know. 
 HOUSE: Doesn't mean anything about you. Wasn't your fault. 
 EVE: I know. 
 HOUSE: You did nothing wrong. Some jerk hurt you, that's all. 
 EVE: [sitting up] I know. 
 HOUSE: You're worried that you can never trust men again. 
 EVE: [shaking her head] No. 
 HOUSE: Statistically, there was always a chance this could happen. The fact that it did happen doesn't change anything. World doesn't suck anymore today than it did yesterday. 
 EVE: I know all that. 
 HOUSE: [no idea what to say] Then what do you want me to tell you? 
 EVE: Nothing. I just want to talk. 
 HOUSE: About nothing. 
 [She nods.] 
 HOUSE: We talk about nothing, nothing will change. 
 EVE: It might. 
 HOUSE: How? 
 EVE: Time. Time changes everything. 
 HOUSE: [trying to shrug it off] It's what people say. It's not true. Doing things changes things. Not doing things,... leaves things exactly as they were. 
 [She looks at him tearfully.] 
 [Homeless Old Guy's Room. Cameron sits by his bed.] 
 CAMERON: Why do you have to suffer? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: I gave my word. 
 CAMERON: Who would make you promise that? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: My father. He said I would die alone and miserable. 
 CAMERON: That's not a promise. And even if it was, he's dead and even if he's not, he's not gonna care. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Why did your husband have to suffer? 
 CAMERON: [astonished] How do you about my husband? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Well, I just know. 
 [Cameron stands up and goes to his bed.] 
 CAMERON: You have to die in pain because of a promise you made to your father? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: If I'd say ""yes"", you'd use that as proof that I'm insane. Force treatment on me. 
 CAMERON: Did the nurse tell you about my husband? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: No. 
 [Not believing it, she walks to the door.] 
 CAMERON: [calling] Nurse! 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Yes! 
 [Cameron turns to him. The nurse appears at the door.] 
 CAMERON: [to the nurse] It's under control. 
 [The nurse nods and leaves. Cameron waits for an explanation.] 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: I'm sorry. I was just trying to freak you out. 
 CAMERON: Why? 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Because I need you to remember me. I need somebody to remember me. 
 [Camera holds on Cameron.] 
 [Eve's room. House is limping around, talking to Eve.] 
 HOUSE: Where'd you go to college? 
 EVE: Northwestern. You? 
 HOUSE: Hopkins. What was your major? 
 EVE: Comparative religion. 
 HOUSE: [has had it] Why do you trust me? 
 EVE: I don't know. Can't we just talk...? 
 HOUSE: [loudly] That's not rational! 
 EVE: Nothing's rational. 
 HOUSE: Everything is rational! 
 EVE: I was r*ped. Explain how that makes sense to you. 
 HOUSE: [beat] We are selfish, base animals, crawling across the earth. But 'cause we got brains, if we try real hard, we can occasionally aspire to something that is less than pure evil. 
 [Long beat.] 
 EVE: [sighs] Has anything terrible ever happened to you? 
 HOUSE: [looks at her] What do you want me to say? 
 EVE: You wanted this conversation. You wanted to talk about something that matters. [appealing] Talk. 
 [House says nothing.] 
 [Wilson's office. Wilson's behind his desk, House sits nearby, feeling restless.] 
 WILSON: She's waiting for your answer? 
 HOUSE: She's asleep. I sedated her. 
 WILSON: [beat] Why do you care what you say? 
 HOUSE: [frustrated] Because I don't know how to answer these questions. 
 WILSON: 'S a simple question. Has your life sucked? Tell her the truth. Tell her you were shot. Tell her... 
 HOUSE: She doesn't wanna hear the truth. She's looking for something. Looking to extrapolate something... 
 WILSON: She's looking to connect with you, and that's what's scaring the hell out of you. Tell her the truth. 
 HOUSE: There is no truth. 
 WILSON: [thinks] Are we role-playing? Am I you? I don't wanna be you. 
 HOUSE: She's not asking for test results. She's not asking what two plus two equals. She's asking for my personal life experience, so she can extrapolate the law of humanity. That's not truth, that's bad science. 
 WILSON: It's not science at all. Tell her the truth. 
 [House looks at him.] 
 [PPTH Hallway. House walks with Cameron, now seeking her advice.] 
 CAMERON: Tell her your life has been good. 
 HOUSE: It hasn't been. 
 CAMERON: Tell her anyway. She wants hope, she wants to know that what happened to her wasn't the norm. Things can be okay, which means maybe they can be okay for her again. 
 [They step into the elevator, she hits a button. The door closes.] 
 [PPTH Hallway. The doors open. This time, Foreman and House step out, the former doing the advising.] 
 FOREMAN: Tell her your life sucked. 
 HOUSE: It didn't. 
 FOREMAN: Tell her anyway. She wants to know she's not alone. She wants to know she's gonna survive this thing. Other people have been through this and worse, and come out the other end. She wants to know she's going to heal. 
 [They stop walking. Foreman looks at House.] 
 FOREMAN: Act like... you've healed. 
 [He walks off, leaving a pensive House.] 
 [PPTH Hallway. And now, it's Chase's turn.] 
 CHASE: Tell her... [thinks, almost says something but stops, then gives up] Keep her asleep. 
 HOUSE: Thanks, you've all been a huge help. 
 CHASE: There's no wrong answer. Because there's no right answer. 
 HOUSE: Wrong. We just don't know what the right answer is. 
 [He gets up and leaves.] 
 [Eve's room. House stands over a sleeping Eve.] 
 HOUSE: Wake up. 
 [She takes a while to awaken. She groggily turns her head to look at him.] 
 HOUSE: 'S not bad as what happened to you, I don't think. I don't know what happened to you. And given how lousy you're responding, I assumed it was worse than getting abused by your grandmother. 
 [Eve sits up.] 
 EVE: What did she do to you? 
 HOUSE: Parents travelled a lot, leaving me with her. She liked things the way she liked them. She believed in discipline. [?], I hardly ever screwed up when she was around. Too scared of... being forced to sleep in the yard or take a bath in ice. [beat] Your turn. 
 EVE: Your parents, they-they never stopped her? 
 HOUSE: [sitting on a chair] Never told them. 
 EVE: Why not? 
 HOUSE: Usual reasons. I was afraid they wouldn't believe me and I was afraid they'd think I' done something wrong. [beat] I opened up to you, you open up to me. 
 EVE: What did you call her? 
 HOUSE: Oma. 
 EVE: And you kept calling her that after this? 
 HOUSE: Dutch for ""grandmother"". She's still my grandmother. And she was still Dutch. 
 EVE: [skeptically] Is any part of that story true? 
 HOUSE: All of it. 
 EVE: [shakes her head] You wouldn't keep calling her ""Oma"". [angry] Something would have to change. 
 HOUSE: You don't know me. 
 EVE: [loudly] You wouldn't keep calling her ""Oma""! 
 HOUSE: Look, you're overreacting. 
 EVE: Do not dismiss me! 
 HOUSE: Not dismissing you. Saying you're not acting rationally. 
 EVE: I'm angry because you're lying to me. 
 HOUSE: [getting angry himself] No. You're... 
 EVE: What can I do? What the hell can I do that you're not gonna dismiss as just being because I was r*ped? 
 [She looks at him angrily.] 
 HOUSE: [softly] Nothing. 
 EVE: [calming a bit] Your story. Is it true? 
 HOUSE: [sighs] True for somebody. 
 EVE: But not for you. 
 HOUSE: [getting up] These things happen. Happened to somebody. What do you care if it happened to me? 
 EVE: They're not in this room. 
 HOUSE: [loudly] No! They're out there! Doctors, lawyers,... postal workers! Some of them doing great, some of them doing lousy! You're gonna base your whole life on who you got stuck in a room with? 
 EVE: [stubborn] I'm gonna base this moment on who I'm stuck in a room with. It's what life is. It's a series of rooms. And who we get stuck in those rooms with adds up to what our lives are. 
 [They look at each other. The door slides open. Cuddy's at the door.] 
 CUDDY: House. 
 [House looks at Eve one more time and leaves. Eve sleeps back.] 
 [Outside Eve's room. House slides the door shut and speaks to Cuddy.] 
 HOUSE: You gotta get me out of this. There's nothing to diagnose. There's nothing... 
 CUDDY: You only tested her for STDs? 
 HOUSE: I had seven morons who forgot their raincoats. 'S all they asked for, so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why? 
 CUDDY: I wasted their time. [softly] She's pregnant. 
 [Genuinely surprised, House looks at Eve in her room. Eve is sitting up, tousling her hair. She looks at him. Camera holds on House.] 
 [Eve's room. House, sitting next to Eve, tells her about her pregnancy. Eve sits motionless in her bed.] 
 HOUSE: You understand? [beat] You okay? I know you're not okay. Are you more or less not okay than you were five 
 minutes ago. 
 EVE: About the same. 
 HOUSE: Termination procedure is unpleasant. 
 EVE: I don't wanna terminate. 
 HOUSE: You wanna keep the baby? 
 EVE: Abortion is m*rder. 
 HOUSE: True. [nods] It's a life. And you should end it. 
 EVE: [rationalising] Every life is sacred. 
 HOUSE: [looks to the heavens in exasperation] Talk to me, don't quote me bumper stickers. 
 EVE: It's true. 
 HOUSE: It's meaningless. 
 EVE: It means every life matters to God. 
 HOUSE: Not to me, not to you. [getting up to pace around] Judging by the number of natural disasters, not to God 
 either. 
 EVE: You're just being argumentative. 
 HOUSE: Yeah! I do do that. What about Hitler? Is his life sacred to God? Father of your child? Is his life sacred to you? 
 EVE: My child isn't Hitler. 
 HOUSE: Either every life is sacred or... 
 EVE: [shouts] Stop it! I don't wanna chat about philosophy! 
 HOUSE: You're not k*lling your r*pe baby because of a philosophy. 
 EVE: It's m*rder! I'm against it. You for it? 
 HOUSE: Not as a general rule. 
 EVE: Just for unborn children? 
 HOUSE: Yes! [beat] The probable exceptions to rules is the line drawn. Might makes sense for us to k*ll the ass that did this to you. But where do we draw the line? Which asses do we get to k*ll? Which asses get to keep on being asses? Nice thing about the abortion debate is we can quibble over trimesters, but ultimately there's an ice-cold line - birth. Morally, there isn't a lot of difference. Practically, huge. 
 EVE: You're enjoying this conversation. 
 HOUSE: [cracks a smile] This is the type of conversation I do well. 
 EVE: But the other type? [beat] The personal stuff? 
 HOUSE: There are no answers.If there are no answers, why talk about it? 
 [Eve looks down tearfully.] 
 HOUSE: You're healthy. You shouldn't be here. 
 EVE: I don't wanna go. 
 HOUSE: [beat] Fine. I won't discharge you. [thinks] Wanna go for a walk? 
 [Homeless Old Guy's room. He's lying down, in obvious discomfort. He lets out a painful sigh. Outside, Cameron strides purposefully to the door and opens it.] 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: The last of my journey. 
 CAMERON: You don't deserve pain. You're just an insane, old man. 
 [She grabs a syringe from her lab coat pocket with her right hand and moves to inject the contents into his IV line. He reaches out and grabs her right hand.] 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: No. No. 
 CAMERON: I'm not gonna watch you suffer. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: [still holding her right hand] I need you to remember me. 
 CAMERON: [shouting at his obstinacy] I'll remember you! 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: Why? 
 CAMERON: Because you're a nice man. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: You don't know that. You don't know anything about me. 
 CAMERON: Either you're a nice man or you're an ass. Either way you did something to somebody that they're gonna remember. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: [wheezing] I have no family, I have no friends. I didn't even have a real job. If I die in peace, then I'm just another patient. But if I die suffering... 
 CAMERON: [appealing] It'll be horrible. Don't do that to either of us. 
 HOMELESS OLD GUY: No! I just need to die, knowing that something is different because I was here. 
 [He stops and starts to groan a bit. Cameron looks at him sympathetically and puts the syringe down. His breathing becomes even more laborious. She takes a seat nearby, trying not to cry. His groaning continues.] 
 [Jogging park. House and Eve are at the same picnic table as before. Eve sits on the table, House stands. Eve looks a bit less miserable.] 
 HOUSE: Life goes on. 
 EVE: Is that the reason we're out here? 
 HOUSE: Know why I come here? I sit, I watch, I imagine. 
 [He limps over to the table and sits on the bench.] 
 EVE: Sounds nice. 
 HOUSE: [pointing to joggers] Imagine if one of them would break a leg. 
 [She smiles (for the first time) at his cynicism.] 
 HOUSE: Just one false step. One crack in the sidewalk. 
 EVE: [smiling] You don't really. 
 HOUSE: I'm evil. 
 EVE: Evil people don't say they're evil. 
 HOUSE: Sounds like an easy loophole. [beat] People can do good things, but their instincts are not good. Either God doesn't exist or he's unimaginably cruel. 
 EVE: [has lost the smile, shakes her head] I don't believe that. 
 HOUSE: What do you believe? Why do you think this happened? 
 EVE: [gets of the table and walks a bit] I don't wanna talk about it. 
 HOUSE: Me neither. Too bad. 
 EVE: [irritably] Y'know, I don't think there was a reason! [sighs] 
 HOUSE: Huh-huh. So God does exist, 'less you get r*ped. Easier to keep your r*pe baby for no reason. 
 EVE: [crying] Maybe he was challenging me! 
 HOUSE: He hurts you to help you. 
 [Eve nods.] 
 HOUSE: I guess it's better than he hates you. 
 EVE: [shouting, voice breaking] You're trying to convince me there's no God! Why would you even say something like that? 
 HOUSE: Because you're throwing your life away. 
 EVE: I'm doing what I believe! 
 HOUSE: What you believe doesn't make sense. 
 EVE: This is not helping me. 
 [She picks up her stuff to leave.] 
 HOUSE: Then I can't help you. 
 [Eve stops.] 
 HOUSE: If you believe in eternity, then... life is irrelevant. Same way that a bug is irrelevant in comparison to the universe. 
 EVE: [turns to face him] If you don't believe in eternity, then what you do here is irrelevant. 
 HOUSE: [jabbing the table with his finger] Your actions here are all that matters. 
 EVE: Then nothing matters. There's no ultimate consequences. I couldn't live with that. 
 HOUSE: So you need to think that the guy that did this to you is gonna be punished. 
 EVE: I need to know that it all means something. I need that comfort. 
 HOUSE: Yeah. You feeling comfortable? Feeling good right now? Feeling warm inside? 
 [She sits down in front of him, on the bench.] 
 EVE: I was r*ped. What's your excuse? 
 [He has no answer.] 
 [Homeless Old Guy's room. Cameron sits sullenly, while he continues to suffer quietly in agony. She watches him, tears welling up in her eyes. He stiffens suddenly, and his chest drops, as he exhales his last breath. The monitor starts to whine (The Tune of Death). A nurse wheels in a crash cart, but Cameron stops her. She continues to look at the unfortunate man.] 
 [Jogger's park. House and Eve sit on the park bench in silence.] 
 EVE: [sighs, looks at House] Do you think the guy who did this to me feels bad? 
 HOUSE: That'll help you? Make you feel better? 
 EVE: Why do you always do that? Ask why I'm asking a question, instead of just answering the question. 
 HOUSE: The answer doesn't interest me. I don't care what he's feeling. I'm interested in what you're feeling. 
 EVE: You are? 
 HOUSE: I'm trapped in a room with you, right? 
 [She smiles a bit.] 
 HOUSE: Why did you choose me? 
 EVE: There's something about you. 'S like you're hurt too. 
 [House slowly brings his right leg out from between the table and bench and sits facing away from the table.] 
 HOUSE: [softly] It was true. 
 EVE: What was? 
 HOUSE: Wasn't my grandmother, but it was true. 
 EVE: Who was it? 
 HOUSE: It's my dad. 
 [They sit quietly for a few seconds.] 
 EVE: I'd like to tell you what happened to me now. 
 HOUSE: I'd like to hear it. 
 EVE: It was a friend's birthday party... 
 [The camera pans up slowly as Eve tells her story to House.] 
 [Homeless Old Guy's room. Cameron slowly removes the man's finger monitor and pushes his hair back carefully. She picks up a towel and wets it. She dabs the towel on his arm, looking at him, still feeling downcast.] 
 [Aerial shot of a recently snowed-upon PPTH. Evening.] 
 [Doctor's lounge. House and Wilson play a friendly game of Foosball. Cuddy enters. The guys don't stop their game, though.] 
 HOUSE: [concentrating more on the game] She terminated it. She's been discharged. 
 CUDDY: She's gonna be okay. 
 HOUSE: [eyes still on the game] Yeah, it's that simple. 
 [Wilson looks at him, but says nothing. He returns his focus to the game.] 
 CUDDY: She's talking about what happened. That's huge. You did good. 
 HOUSE: Everyone will tell you... that that's what we gotta make her do. We have to help her, right? Except we can't. We drag out her story. Tell each other that it'll help her heal. Feel real good about ourselves. But all we've done is make a girl cry. 
 WILSON: [more interested in what House is saying than the game] Then why did you...? 
 [Bad move - he takes his eye off the game. House scores!] 
 HOUSE: [finally looks up] Because I don't know. 
 [Picking up his cane, he starts to leave.] 
 WILSON: You gonna follow up with her? 
 HOUSE: [collecting his jacket] One day, one room.

house_3_17,412142,3,17,"[Setting is an industrial-type loft. Loud music in the background. The wooden gate on the freight elevator is pulled up and Emma enters.] 
 Emma: Hey. [She removes her shoulder bag and hands it off as she walks through the room.] 
 Tyson Ritter: You got this whole thing wrong, Em. It‚Äôs the rock star that‚Äôs supposed to be late, not the rock star photographer. 
 Emma: Sorry. Morning sickness. Touch the belly. 
 Tyson: It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been asked to do that. 
 Emma: Come on. It‚Äôs good luck. [As he does a two-handed feel of her very pregnant belly in several positions, Emma calls to assistants.] 
 Tyson: Mmm. Ooh 
 Emma: Get the keynotes behind the drop. [Lights come on in back. Guitar is slung over Tyson‚Äôs back.] So, what do you think? 
 [He looks behind him at the set. It is a wall of an old-fashioned schoolhouse, very Norman Rockwell. There is a green chalkboard with ‚ÄúThe All-American Rejects‚Äù heavily chalked on it.] 
 Tyson: Uh, I think people aren‚Äôt going to get it. 
 Emma: Come on. All-American Rejects. Juxtaposing a classic image of Americana with modern pop culture. You. 
 Tyson: Oh, yeah. Everyone loves a good juxtaposition. My fans were born in the 90s. 
 Emma: You know what? You do this picture, you‚Äôll gain forty years of fans. 
 Tyson: Yeah? 
 Emma: Yeah. 
 Tyson: Love the Rockwell thing. 
 Emma: I thought so. Okay. k*ll the house lights. Let‚Äôs go. [She starts taking pictures.] Hang on. Hey. Who‚Äôs in charge of the backdrop? Naomi! 
 Naomi: Yeah? 
 Tyson: [looks behind him] What‚Äôs wrong with it? 
 Emma: Uh, well the words are completely jumbled. [He looks again.] What? You can read that? 
 Tyson: Of course. You okay? 
 Emma: No. Oh, God. [She puts camera down and the background music stops.] I could be having a‚Ä¶ a‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the mnemonic? Uh‚Ä¶ F. F is for face. Is my smile crooked? [She smiles at Tyson. Her lower lip is drooping on the left side.] 
 Tyson: What are you doing? 
 Emma: A. A is for arms. Arms. [She puts her arms in front of her. One tilts up, the other down and she starts leaning backwards.] 
 Tyson: You should really sit down. Can somebody get her some water. [His voice has a bit of an echo. As the scene goes on, the echo gets louder.] 
 Emma: S. S is speech. I‚Äôm slurring. I‚Äôm slurring? Huh. Oh! [Tyson puts down guitar and turns back to Emma.] Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I‚Äôm having a stroke. [She falls flat on her back and lays there. Everyone rushes around her.] 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs hospital room. House is standing in doorway. He inhales loudly.] 
 House: Hi. I‚Äôm Dr. House. My boss says you‚Äôre important. [Slides door closed.] 
 Emma: Oh. 
 House: Personally I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty. Arms out in front of you. [She does so while he gets an otoscope out of a drawer on the other side of the room.] With your palms up, like you‚Äôre holding a pizza. Close your eyes. 
 Emma: It‚Äôs so easy, you should consider a career change. Probably make a lot more money. [With her eyes closed, her right hand starts turning inward.] 
 House: Dr. Mackman tell you the clot was clear? 
 Emma: Yes. 
 House: And he said you and the fetus are fine. 
 Emma: Yeah. 
 House: He didn‚Äôt mention your pronator drift. 
 Emma: What‚Äôs that mean? 
 House: It means Mackman is an idiot. [He sighs and gestures to the side of the bed.] May I? 
 Emma: Yeah. [He moves her camera out of the way so he can sit on the bed.] 
 House: So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business. [He is checking her eyes while they talk.] 
 Emma: It‚Äôs not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep sh**ting until I can see what‚Äôs really inside them. My eyes okay? 
 House: Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don‚Äôt look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes. 
 Emma: This is going to happen again? 
 House: Unless I can figure out the underlying cause. Puff up your cheeks. [She does and he taps them. They deflate with a slight popping sound.] You should be able to keep the air in. It means there‚Äôs weakness around the mouth. So, where‚Äôd you learn to self-diagnose a stroke? 
 Emma: Oh, my uh‚Ä¶ baby‚Äôs biological father is a neurologist. He once told me the FAST mnemonic could save my life one day so ‚Äì 
 House: Interesting pet name. Most people go with ‚Äúhusband‚Äù or ‚Äúpookie.‚Äù 
 Emma: He‚Äôs gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you ‚Äì 
 House: You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date? 
 Emma: Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom. 
 House: A man after my own heart. Different magazine, obviously. [Emma smiles.] I‚Äôm rescinding Mackman‚Äôs discharge order. My lackeys will be in to do some more tests, take some more blood and empty your catheter bag. [She has started taking pictures of him. He glowers slightly.] Not a moment you‚Äôll want to cherish. [He holds up catheter bag which contains a dark red liquid. She stares.] 
 [Cut to three fellows studying something.] 
 Foreman: This is‚Ä¶ definitely different. 
 [We see they are staring at a black & white, 8x10 glossy photo of House clipped on a light board.] 
 Chase: It looks almost like ‚Äì 
 Cameron: He‚Äôs caring. [House enters, walks to picture and pulls it down.] 
 House: Find anything else in the patient‚Äôs folder? Like a diagnosis? 
 Foreman: Urinalysis revealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine level over 2.5. 
 House: So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why? 
 Chase: Ultrasound showed no tumors or stones, no signs of fetal distress, no urinary tract obstructions. 
 Cameron: BP is fine. No preeclampsia. 
 House: Any of you guys ever been to the Galapagos? 
 Foreman: Was our patient there? Dengue fever, avian pox. Even West Nile. 
 House: No. I‚Äôm looking for a vacation spot. 
 Chase: That mean we get vacation? 
 House: How would that differ from your current status? 
 Cameron: You‚Äôre going to do what? Relax? 
 House: Visiting family. My uncle‚Äôs a giant turtle. 
 Cameron: What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around. 
 House: Kidneys don‚Äôt often get stuck in the brain. 
 Cameron: I‚Äôm saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness. 
 House: Heart‚Äôs way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney. 
 Cameron: Echo‚Äôs normal. The history indicates no sign of cardiac problems. 
 House: No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep. 
 Foreman: In her throat. That‚Äôs the one about 10 inches above the heart. 
 House: Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep. 
 Cameron: She was prescribed antibiotics. 
 House: No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated? 
 Chase: It leads to rheumatic fever. 
 House: Which leads to, Cameron? 
 Cameron: Mitral valve stenosis. 
 House: Which is a thickening in the valve of the‚Ä¶kidney? No. The kidney doesn‚Äôt have a mitral valve. 
 Foreman: We‚Äôll go look at the heart. [The fellows start to leave. House calls after them.] 
 House: It‚Äôll be easy to find. It‚Äôs the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat. 
 [Cut to MRI room. Emma is on the table, Chase and Cameron sit behind the computer screens.] 
 Cameron: That was weird. 
 Chase: He was the way he always is. 
 Cameron: Which is weird. [Into microphone] Stay still, Emma. 
 Emma: Sorry. 
 Cameron: No problem. [She click microphone off.] He caught us with your hand up my shirt. He‚Äôs gotta have a reaction to that. You think that‚Äôs what the vacation is? 
 Chase: Yes. The pain of losing you is obviously forcing him away. Coronal slice appears normal. 
 Cameron: There‚Äôs no way House just lets this slide. He‚Äôs gotta be planning something. 
 Chase: Maybe he just doesn‚Äôt give a crap. Sagittal slice is clean. 
 Cameron: You think he just stumbled into that closet? He knew we were there. And he wanted us to know that he knew. 
 Chase: Or, you wanted him to know. Now he does and you‚Äôre annoyed because he doesn‚Äôt care. [He double clicks a computer key.] Right there. Transaxial slice. Calcified mitral valve. 
 Cameron: Barely. That‚Äôs not big enough to throw a clot. 
 Chase: Obviously it is because it did. House was right. 
 [Cut to treatment room. Cameron and Chase are wearing blue lead aprons and are setting up a procedure. Emma is on the table.] 
 Chase: The valve in your heart is narrowed. It caused the clot which led to your stroke and the reduced circulation caused the problems with your kidneys. 
 Emma: And this‚Äôll fix it? 
 Cameron: The balloon will force the valve back open and you‚Äôll be fine. [Cuddy quietly slides open the door.] 
 Emma: Can I do this without a sedative. 
 Chase: It‚Äôs really very mild. There really is no risk to the fetus. 
 Cuddy: We‚Äôll monitor the baby‚Äôs heart rate separately. We won‚Äôt allow it to decrease anywhere near dangerous levels. {She turns on second monitor which shows a heart rate of 208.] 
 Emma: Thank you. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôre both going to be fine. Go ahead, Dr. Cameron. 
 Emma: [As Cameron injects dye into shunt.] Listen to that heartbeat‚Ä¶ Sounds so ‚Äì 
 Cuddy: Start threading the catheter. 
 [As Chase inserts the catheter, cut to CGI of catheter pushing things open.] 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs office. He is standing behind his desk, on the phone.] 
 House: I don‚Äôt want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario. That‚Äôs why I asked for a direct flight to Phnom Penh. [To fellows who have entered] How hard is it to not land? [Back to phone] Does it matter what I answer? Well then, fine, I‚Äôd be delighted to hold. [Back to fellows] What‚Äôs new? 
 Cameron: Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering? 
 House: It‚Äôs her job. What‚Äôs new? 
 Chase: The good news is Emma‚Äôs heart is fixed. The bad news is it‚Äôs not her underlying problem. Her kidneys are still failing. 
 Foreman: You‚Äôre vacationing in Cambodia? You‚Äôre going to unwind in the k*lling fields? 
 House: Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. [He holds his arms very wide.] Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds. 
 Foreman: Aren‚Äôt those catfish critically endangered? 
 House: That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs my last chance to catch one. [He puts phone on speaker and replaces it in cradle. ‚ÄúAll of our operators are currently‚Ä¶‚Äù] If the mitral valve had been fixed, the kidneys should be getting better which leads us to the conclusion that you screwed up the procedure. 
 Cameron: Or you screwed up the diagnosis. Mitral valve thickening was so insignificant it probably wasn‚Äôt the cause of the kidneys or the stroke. Probably never would have been a problem. 
 Foreman: She needs dialysis. And we need a new theory. 
 Chase: There are only a few possibilities. Patient‚Äôs pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because ‚Äì 
 House: Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else? 
 Cameron: Hypoperfusion. The fetus is basically a parasite, stealing nutrients, minerals, blood. 
 House: Put her on telemetry. 
 Foreman: Or the pregnancy‚Äôs irrelevant. Could be infection, sepsis, HUS/TTP ‚Äì 
 Chase: A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys. 
 House: Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque. 
 Cameron: That‚Äôs it, has to be one of those five. 
 House: You know what would be even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one. [They fellows leave in unison.] 
 Phone: Thank you for holding. [House grabs receiver.] We are experiencing extremely high call volume. Thank you for your patience. [House hangs up.] 
 [Cut to CGI of Emma‚Äôs blood.] 
 Cameron: [Looking up from microscope and turning to the others.] She‚Äôs 0 for 5. 
 House: Either the differential was wrong or she‚Äôs faking it. 
 Chase: Kidney failure has to be precipitated by ‚Äì 
 Foreman: By one of the five we‚Äôve already ruled out. 
 Chase: The body only has so many ways of screwing with the kidneys. The labs must be wrong. 
 Foreman: We did the labs. No one else had access. 
 House: That‚Äôs not quite true. [He exits.] 
 [Cut to House entering Emma‚Äôs room.] 
 Emma: [Through oxygen mask] You put all your patients through this many tests or just the important ones? 
 House: [Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor] We wanted to explore all the possibilities. 
 Emma: And? 
 House: We‚Äôve eliminated all the possibilities. 
 Emma: You‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm dying and you have no idea why? 
 House: Your body is functioning properly. 
 Emma: So why are my kidneys failing? 
 House: The other body isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs something wrong with the fetus. [Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.] 
 [Emma lies on her bed as House begins to talk in voice over. Cut to Diagnostics Office.] 
 House: Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome. [As he pulls back to underline it, we see that he has written RORRIM except the Rs are reversed too.] Mom‚Äôs body is like an intricate German metro system. All the trains run on time. When she gets pregnant, it‚Äôs like a new station opening in Dusseldorf. A bunch of rookies running things, bound to be mistakes. Kids play on the tracks, get electrocuted. Before you know it, trains are backed up all the way to Berlin and you‚Äôve got a bunch of angry Germans with nowhere to go. And we all know that ain‚Äôt good for the Jews. 
 Chase: Who are the Jews in this metaphor? 
 House: A few things can happen to a fetus in distress. It can become a miscarriage, stillbirth, very sick baby or, on rare occasion, a time b*mb that kills mom while it‚Äôs dying. The good news is, we fix the fetus, mom gets better. It‚Äôs the diagnostic equivalent of a two-for-one sale. 
 Cameron: I‚Äôve read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable. 
 House: Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for ‚Äúdead baby?‚Äù You think she‚Äôll be less upset if you phrase it nicely? 
 Chase: We can tell her the truth ‚Äì that she‚Äôll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can‚Äôt touch it, can‚Äôt ask where it hurts, can‚Äôt see it. 
 House: If only there existed giant machines that could look through human skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes. 
 Cameron: Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma ‚Äì 
 House: All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right? 
 Foreman: Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein‚Äôs anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen‚Äôs vein ‚Äì 
 House: And Dr. Storm Cloud rained all over the differential and k*lled the beautiful little baby. Heart‚Äôs easiest to see, easiest to fix, so let‚Äôs start there. When you did Mom‚Äôs MRI did you get a look at the fetus‚Äô heart? 
 Chase: It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place. 
 House: So we need another scan. 
 Foreman: Yeah. We‚Äôll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still. 
 House: No need. I‚Äôm going to paralyze it. 
 [Cut to House walking down hallway. Cuddy approaches him.] 
 Cuddy: You want to paralyze Emma Sloan‚Äôs baby? 
 House: Let me guess. Cameron. 
 Cuddy: Cameron and Chase both had their concerns. 
 House: No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn‚Äôt want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug. 
 Cuddy: They‚Äôre sleeping together? 
 House: If by ‚Äúsleeping together‚Äù you mean having sex in the janitor‚Äôs closet. 
 Cuddy: Here? 
 House: No, the janitor‚Äôs closet at the local high school. [Pumps his fist] Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account. 
 Cuddy: I will deal with them after I deal with you. 
 House: Oh, come on. Let‚Äôs gossip some more. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs into bondage. [Cuddy grabs his arm and turns him to look at her.] 
 Cuddy: Paralyzing a one pound baby risks damaging ‚Äì 
 House: No paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of it‚Äôs heart. Which we need to save it‚Äôs life which we need to do to save Emma‚Äôs life. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôre gonna need to get her consent. 
 House: That shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die. 
 Cuddy: I‚Äôm going with you. 
 House: Oh, good. 
 [Cut to House squirting gel on Emma‚Äôs belly.] 
 Emma: You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane. 
 House: The injection goes into the umbilical cord. 
 Cuddy: The baby won‚Äôt feel a thing. 
 House: Fetus! I‚Äôm lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay? 
 [Emma snorts/sighs] 
 Cuddy: It must be easier to hear that you might die than your baby might die. But if there‚Äôs anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be Dr. House. [Emma snorts again.] 
 House: [whispers] Fetus. Hold this. 
 [House hand Cuddy the sonogram wand as he uncaps syringe and watches sonogram as he sticks it in Emma‚Äôs belly. Cut to CGI of the fetus as the needle is inserted in the umbilical cord.] 
 [Cut to Ob unit. Cuddy is looking at newborns as Cameron approaches.] 
 Cuddy: Dr. Cameron, the MRI results back? 
 Cameron: The fetus‚Äô heart is structurally sound. The problem‚Äôs with the bladder. It‚Äôs four times normal size. 
 Cuddy: Let me see. [She reaches for the patient folder in Cameron‚Äôs hand.] 
 Cameron: The bladder‚Äôs so engorged it‚Äôs taking up the whole torso, squeezing all the other organs. There‚Äôs no room for the lungs to develop. 
 Cuddy: [looking at film] The baby has a lower urinary tract obstruction. We can fix that by inserting a shunt. I‚Äôll give Emma the news. 
 Cameron: Are you‚Ä¶ taking over the case? 
 Cuddy: House won‚Äôt care. He has his diagnosis. [She starts to leave, then stops] Dr. Cameron. Dating Chase‚Ä¶ can only end in one of two ways. 
 Cameron: House told you? 
 Cuddy: You get married and live happily ever after or somebody gets hurt and you two can‚Äôt work together and I have to fire somebody. 
 Cameron: I would hate to see my personal life become such a burden to you. 
 Cuddy: I‚Äôm telling you this for your own good. 
 Cameron: Well I assume you‚Äôre going to have this same conversation with Chase for his own good. 
 Cuddy: Chase isn‚Äôt the one who‚Äôs gonna get hurt here. 
 [Cut to treatment room with hyperbaric chamber. Cameron enters and knocks on the chamber window. House is inside and turns to see her. She picks up phone. He looks around, picks up the receiver inside the chamber and lies back down.] 
 House: There‚Äôs only room for one. Though I could scooch over. 
 Cameron: My social life is my social life. 
 House: Couldn‚Äôt agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor‚Äôs closet is nobody‚Äôs business except ‚Äì 
 Cameron: She told me to end it. Is that what you want? 
 House: I was actually hoping she‚Äôd fire one of you. 
 Cameron: What are you doing? 
 House: Trying to avoid altitude sickness. Couldn‚Äôt score a direct flight to Cambodia so I decided to scale Argentina‚Äôs infamous Mount Aconcagua 
 Cameron: Perfect, except for the fact that you can‚Äôt walk. 
 House: There‚Äôs a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up ‚Äì 
 Cameron: You‚Äôre insane. 
 House: I‚Äôm an insane genius. Set the chamber to low pressure instead of high. Thinner air builds up extra red blood cells. Creates new capillaries. Few more days in here and I can save myself six weeks in base camp. Where‚Äôs my MRI? [Cameron slams down the phone.] 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs room. Cuddy has the MRI on a light board.] 
 Cuddy: There‚Äôs a blockage in the urinary tract. Simple terms, your baby can‚Äôt pee. His bladder is swollen and it‚Äôs crushing his lungs. 
 Emma: Well, can you fix it? 
 Cuddy: We can insert a small tube in the baby‚Äôs bladder that makes the bladder come out straight through his belly for the duration of the pregnancy. The bladder decompresses and the lungs will be able to develop normally. When the baby gets better, you should get better. 
 Emma: Wow. 
 Cuddy: First we just have to do a test to determine whether the baby‚Äôs kidneys are functioning properly. 
 Emma: And what if they‚Äôre not? 
 Cuddy: If they‚Äôre already too damaged, then there‚Äôs really nothing we can do. If this doesn‚Äôt work out, you can always try again. 
 Emma: Wow. I miscarried twice when I was married. After the divorce, I tried in vitro like four times before this. I‚Äôm 42. Maybe its, uh, just not meant to be. 
 [Cut to Cuddy walking into her office. House is behind her desk.] 
 Cuddy: What are you doing? 
 House: Well, you‚Äôre trying to be me so I thought I‚Äôd try to be you. 
 Cuddy: You don‚Äôt have the cleavage for it. 
 House: But I have a much tighter ass. You think every day should be naked Thursday or is that an oxymoron? [She reaches over and turns off the computer monitor. He sticks out his hand for the test results.] Let me see the results of the bladder tap. 
 Cuddy: They aren‚Äôt back yet. 
 House: They‚Äôre gonna to be inconclusive. 
 Cuddy: You think my diagnosis is wrong? 
 House: Fetus doesn‚Äôt pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom‚Äôs level is fine. 
 Cuddy: Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm wrong. Could just means we caught the obstruction early. 
 House: Either way, your test will be inconclusive. The urine you collected has been sitting in that fetus‚Äô bladder for weeks. And, as my pappy always said, ‚Äústale pee is useless pee.‚Äù 
 Cuddy: Fine, then I‚Äôll do another tap. 
 House: Just as useless. Old urine drops down from the kidney right after the first tap ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs all backed up. Bladder tap number three will give you the freshest pee and it‚Äôs when you‚Äôll find out if this fetus has even a fighting chance. 
 Cuddy: Thank you. I‚Äôll run two more taps. 
 House: Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps? 
 Cuddy: She‚Äôs an important patient. 
 House: Because she takes pictures? Or because she‚Äôs you? Woman in her forties. Single. Using a turkey baster as a last gasp of motherhood. And you want to make sure she succeeds, so you‚Äôll still have hope. Can‚Äôt be a good doctor if you‚Äôre not objective. 
 Cuddy: [Pushing the file at him] It‚Äôs your file. 
 House: I don‚Äôt want it. 
 Cuddy: Then why did you just say all that stuff? 
 House: To humiliate you. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôre taking the case back. 
 House: I don‚Äôt want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation. 
 Cuddy: [Shoves the file in his hand] You can go on vacation after you‚Äôve cured her. 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs room. Chase enters.] 
 Chase: Good news. Fetus‚Äô urine had appropriate levels of protein and electrolytes so its kidneys aren‚Äôt damaged. 
 Emma: Oh. Wow. 
 Chase: We‚Äôre going to put the shunt in. Your baby‚Äôs lungs should have more room to grow and your symptoms should go away. 
 Emma: But he‚Äôll still need surgery? After he‚Äôs born? 
 Chase: That‚Äôs when we‚Äôll remove the blockage in the ureter. You‚Äôll be the only mother on the planet who appreciates the value of a wet diaper. 
 Emma: Hey, could you hand me that? [Points to camera] I‚Äôm keeping a visual memory book of this entire, surreal process and this is the best part of the story so far. 
 Chase: Yeah. Sure. 
 Emma: Thanks. 
 Chase: [Sees picture of Cameron on top of a pile] When did you take this? 
 Emma: Oh. She did the second bladder tap. You should keep it. 
 Chase: Oh, I see her all day at work. I don‚Äôt need it. 
 Emma: Maybe you want to see her after work. I‚Äôm right, right? I saw the way you look at her. [Chase picks up picture and smiles, looking at it, as Emma takes pictures of him.] 
 Chase: [taking the picture and leaving] Thanks. 
 [Emma laughs] 
 [Cut to OR. Doctors inserting shunt through Emma‚Äôs belly. Cut to Chase and Cameron performing ultrasound on Emma in her room.] 
 Cameron: Shunt is in the right position. The bladder‚Äôs starting to decompress. 
 Chase: No infection. Did House say anything else? About us? 
 Cameron: I thought you didn‚Äôt care about his reaction. Trying to make him jealous? 
 Chase: I like my job. 
 Cameron: He can‚Äôt fire you just because we‚Äôre together. 
 Chase: We‚Äôre not together. And House can do whatever he wants. 
 Emma: [breathing heavily as she wakes up] How‚Äôs my baby? 
 Cameron: Doing just fine, Emma. So are you. 
 Emma: My stomach is k*lling me. [She rubs her side.] 
 Chase: That‚Äôs not her stomach. [He leans over to check her.] 
 Cameron: Can you open your eyes, Emma? I just need to take a look. [She pulls open Emma‚Äôs eyelid. Her cornea is yellow.] 
 Emma: [She sees Chase and Cameron looking at her.] What is it. 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs office. All three fellows enter. House is at his computer, wearing sunglasses.] 
 Cameron: Emma‚Äôs jaundiced. Her liver‚Äôs shutting down. 
 House: [big sigh] Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight. 
 Cameron: I thought you were climbing Mount ‚Äì whatever. In Argentina. 
 House: Apparently I‚Äôd have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they‚Äôd consider me an elder. [He tosses his sunglasses on his desk.] I decided to go kayaking with orca instead. No legs required. 
 Foreman: Can‚Äôt leave yet. Liver failure puts her case back in the unsolved pile. 
 Chase: Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin‚Äôs off the charts. 
 House: Even fetuses lie. We diagnosed a lower urinary tract obstruction because we saw one. What if that‚Äôs not the whole story. What if the little bugger is hiding something? Real reason for the mirror syndrome. Have we looked under its bed? Have we checked its diary? 
 Foreman: It‚Äôs not GU. Could be the heart. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. 
 Chase: There were no structural problems. 
 Foreman: The lungs ‚Äì 
 Cameron: We won‚Äôt be able to get a good look until they develop. It‚Äôll be weeks 
 House: She‚Äôs not going to last weeks. 
 Foreman: What do you want to do? 
 House: Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus. 
 Chase: It‚Äôs not viable at twenty-one weeks. You‚Äôll k*ll the baby. 
 House: Fetus. 
 Cameron: Do semantics make you feel better? Pretend it‚Äôs not a person? 
 House: Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her? [All three refuse to meet his eyes. He pushes off his desktop and grabs his coat.] 
 [Cut to dialysis unit.] 
 House: The swollen bladder was not the only problem. We can‚Äôt leave it inside you. We have to terminate. 
 Emma: Well, can‚Äôt you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory machine until you figure out what‚Äôs wrong. 
 House: We can. And it won‚Äôt matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable. 
 Emma: Oh, well. I‚Äôll suffer through this for at least two more weeks, then. 
 House: You‚Äôre on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don‚Äôt make dialysis for your liver. You‚Äôre not going to make it two more days. 
 Emma: [thinks about this then shakes her head slightly] I‚Äôm not gonna let you k*ll my baby. 
 House: It‚Äôs k*lling you. 
 Emma: I‚Äôm not having an abortion. 
 House: It‚Äôs not a baby. It‚Äôs a‚Ä¶tumor. [She holds up her hand in a ‚Äústop‚Äù gesture.] I understand dying for a cause, sacrificing your life so your child might live. But that‚Äôs not the choice here. Either it dies or you both die. 
 Emma: Or you fix him and we both live. 
 House: I can‚Äôt fix it. I‚Äôm scheduling a D and C. [He gets up to leave.] 
 Emma: I won‚Äôt consent. [He stops and looks at her.] So I guess you have two days to figure it out. [He leaves.] 
 [Cut to Cuddy‚Äôs office.] 
 House: Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She‚Äôs developed severe DIC. You have to force her to terminate. 
 Cuddy: Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby‚Äôs lung development? 
 House: No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prevent lung development. I‚Äôm trying to extinguish the human race one fetus at a time. 
 Cuddy: Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they‚Äôre the problem. 
 House: My real patient is dying. Very quickly. Like I wouldn‚Äôt advise her to buy any green bananas. The fetus is nothing more than a parasite at this point. Removing it is an instant cure. 
 Cuddy: You‚Äôre not going to get Emma to see it that way. She‚Äôs probably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him. 
 House: See, you get it. She‚Äôll listen to you. 
 Cuddy: No. 
 House: You let this woman refuse to terminate, you‚Äôre helping her commit su1c1de. As her doctor, my recommendation is against su1c1de. 
 Cuddy: If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life. 
 House: Then she‚Äôd be an idiot. 
 Cuddy: Too bad she‚Äôs your boss. 
 [Cut to Diagnostics Office. Cuddy is by the white board, running the DDX. The fellows are at the table. House is seated by the wall, making a paper airplane.] 
 Cuddy: What if our original assumption is wrong. 
 House: It isn‚Äôt. 
 Cuddy: If we assume she doesn‚Äôt have mirror syndrome then terminating her pregnancy isn‚Äôt going to help her liver at all. 
 Foreman: We eliminated all other possibilities. 
 Chase: The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma‚Äôs kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid. 
 House: Wow. If the ass kisser won‚Äôt agree with you, you must be even wronger than I thought. 
 Cuddy: Fine. Let‚Äôs assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby‚Äôs bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don‚Äôt have to terminate. 
 House: So her theory is that our patient‚Äôs liver problems were just a giant coincidence. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs not a surprising coincidence. Pregnant women can develop liver problems. If this is the case, we can actually do something here. Don‚Äôt you guys think that‚Äôs worth exploring. 
 Cameron: Acute fatty liver of pregnancy would have the same symptoms. 
 Cuddy: Thank you. 
 House: Brown-noser. 
 Chase: Viral hepatitis. HELLP syndrome. 
 House: Oh look. Sticking up for your girlfriend. Who says chivalry‚Äôs dead? 
 Foreman: He‚Äôs not joking? [Cameron gives him an exasperated sigh.] 
 House: Be patient. She‚Äôs going through all of us. She‚Äôll get that jungle fever eventually. [Cameron glares at House.] 
 Cameron: I‚Äôm not going through anyone. 
 House: You love him? [Chase and Cameron each give him a look.] 
 Cuddy: This can probably wait until after we biopsy Emma‚Äôs liver, right? 
 Foreman: We can‚Äôt. Her platelets are too low. Once we pierce her liver, it will be next to impossible to stop the bleeding. 
 Cuddy: Come in from above. Instead of going straight in through her abdomen, go in through the veins in her neck. Transjugular hepatic biopsy. If the liver starts to bleed, it will bleed right back into her own veins. [The fellows leave. House flies his airplane. It hits Cuddy who looks at him. He looks away, innocent.] Why don‚Äôt you start your vacation now? 
 [House leaves.] 
 [Cut to Chase and Foreman doing the biopsy.] 
 Chase: Threading the guidewire through the right internal jugular vein. 
 Foreman: So, the sleep lab. You and Cameron not sleeping. How serious is it? 
 Chase: It‚Äôs nothing. She‚Äôs only doing it to make House jealous. 
 Foreman: Then why are you doing it? 
 Chase: Are you kidding? 
 Foreman: You‚Äôre approaching the interior vena cava. Slow down. Better not hurt her. 
 Chase: She already has a big brother. 
 Foreman: She does? 
 Chase: You obviously care very deeply about her. 
 Foreman: I‚Äôm not protecting her. I‚Äôm protecting myself. A heartbroken, lovesick Cameron would be even more unbearable than she is now. You‚Äôre through the hepatic vein. 
 Chase: Firing the needle. [One of the machines starts beeping quickly.] 
 Foreman: Heart rate and BP spiking. Get that out of her. 
 Chase: Fetus‚Äô heart rate just dropped to 50. [CGI of fetus.] We‚Äôve got contractions. 
 Foreman: Pre-term labor. Start a terbutaline drip. 
 [Cut to Cuddy in her office, playing with a hair scrunchy. The fellows enter.] 
 Chase: We were able to control the pre-term labor with tocolytics. The contractions have subsided, for now. 
 Cameron: And the biopsy was negative. This is definitely mirror syndrome. Her baby‚Äôs doing this to her. 
 Foreman: We‚Äôre out of options. 
 Cuddy: Did the biopsy cause the pre-term labor or did it happen on its own? 
 Chase: It doesn‚Äôt make a difference. 
 Cuddy: Pre-term labor can be a new symptom. New information gives us new theories. Isn‚Äôt that how it works? 
 Foreman: Not in this case. Her body‚Äôs trying to do what you refuse to ‚Äì get the baby out and save itself. 
 Cameron: The patient‚Äôs transaminases are ten times normal. Her liver‚Äôs on the verge of shutting down completely. 
 Cuddy: A torch test could ‚Äì 
 Foreman: We don‚Äôt have time for more tests. We have to terminate or she‚Äôll die. 
 Cuddy: Then let‚Äôs work faster. 
 Cameron: Medicine doesn‚Äôt work faster just because you hope real hard. 
 Cuddy: But it could help to see what the baby‚Äôs been hiding. The only organ we haven‚Äôt been able to look inside is its lungs. The problem must be in there. 
 Chase: We haven‚Äôt been able to seen inside because they‚Äôre underdeveloped. We‚Äôve already got her on corticosteroids but it‚Äôll take weeks before for them ‚Äì 
 Cuddy: Then let‚Äôs drown them in corticosteroids. Multiple courses. Speed up their development. 
 Foreman: Giving the baby more than one course will suppress adrenal gland function. 
 Chase: Have long-term adverse effects on fetal organ development. 
 Cuddy: Worse than death? 
 Cameron: Emma‚Äôs already on tocolytics. The combination could put her into pulmonary edema. You‚Äôll just k*ll her faster. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs the only chance we have to see inside those lungs. We‚Äôre just going to have to make the baby better faster than we make Emma worse. [They look at her.] Come on. This is the kind of thing House does every day. 
 Foreman: House thought we should terminate six hours ago. 
 Cuddy: I‚Äôll do it myself. [She leaves, pulling her hair into a ponytail with the scrunchy.] 
 Cameron: Anybody going to stop her? 
 Chase: Stopping the madness is her job. 
 Foreman: Somebody‚Äôs got to be Cuddy‚Äôs Cuddy. 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs room. Cuddy is injecting something in Emma‚Äôs IV port. She flips a switch and an alarm starts beeping.] 
 Cuddy: Nurse! [Wilson enters.] 
 Wilson: Pulmonary edema? 
 Cuddy: Who tattled? Doesn‚Äôt matter. 
 Wilson: There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt give multiple courses of corticosteroids. 
 Cuddy: Gee, thanks. 
 Wilson: It‚Äôs time to terminate. 
 Cuddy: That‚Äôs not what she wants. 
 Wilson: Look at her. She didn‚Äôt want to be an incubator for a dead baby, but that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve done. 
 Cuddy: Either get me a laryngoscope or get out. [Wilson leaves. Cuddy and two nurses continue working on Emma.] 
 [Cut to PPTH exterior, night.] 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs office. Cuddy enters. She walks to his desk and picks up his oversized tennis ball, tossing it back and forth between her hands a few times. She then bounces it and it bounces away. She rubs her face, apparently in frustration and/or exhaustion.] 
 [Cut to Wilson‚Äôs office. He is doing paperwork. Cuddy comes in and closes the door behind her.] 
 Cuddy: You were right. You were all right. Now the mom‚Äôs lungs are shutting down. [She sits.] She‚Äôs dying faster than the baby‚Äôs lungs are developing. I had to stop the corticosteroids. 
 Wilson: Have you spoken to the family? 
 Cuddy: The only family she‚Äôs got is that baby. 
 Wilson: Well, he‚Äôs biased. 
 Cuddy: What do you think House would do? 
 Wilson: House wants to terminate. 
 Cuddy: I know. I mean if he didn‚Äôt. If he shared my position. What do you think he would do? 
 Wilson: He wouldn‚Äôt share your pain. He‚Äôd be objective. 
 Cuddy: Right. He would prioritize his problems. [She stands and heads toward door.] 
 Wilson: He‚Äôd terminate. 
 Cuddy: He wouldn‚Äôt be afraid of screwing with her lungs if there was a bigger issue. 
 Wilson: There is no bigger issue. She needs her lungs. 
 Cuddy: Not right now. She‚Äôs already on a respirator. The machine is breathing for her. I can do whatever I want to her lungs. If you‚Äôre playing catch in the living room and you break your mother‚Äôs vase you might as well keep playing catch. The vase is already broken. 
 Wilson: Yeah, except that room can‚Äôt breathe without that vase. 
 Cuddy: [leaving] I‚Äôm putting her back on corticosteroids. [She leaves, slamming door. Wilson sighs.] 
 [Cut to House at home. There is a banging on the door. He opens it and Cuddy is there.] 
 Cuddy: It worked. 
 House: What worked? 
 Cuddy: I got the baby‚Äôs lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out ‚Äì 
 House: Cab‚Äôs on it‚Äôs way. I have to finish packing. [She starts to close the door. She pushes it open.] 
 Cuddy: I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to believe when everyone around you is telling you that you‚Äôre wrong. 
 House: Helps to know they‚Äôre idiots. 
 Cuddy: Do you think I‚Äôm an idiot? [She pulls out an x-ray.] 
 House: You‚Äôre not objective. But you‚Äôre not an idiot. [He takes the film and holds it to the light.] His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable. 
 Cuddy: But big enough for a diagnosis. 
 House: These tissue buds are new. Could indicate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic eventration. 
 Cuddy: I was thinking bronchogenetic cysts or bronchial atresia. 
 House: Could be lung lesions. CCAM. 
 Cuddy: What about ‚Äì [House has slammed the door in her face. She stands there for a few seconds, apparently in shock when the door reopens. House has put his jacket on.] 
 House: Move. [He motions for Cuddy to back up so he can lock the door.] 
 [Cut to Diagnostics Office. The fellows are all there. Cameron is pouring a cup of coffee. House and Cuddy enter.] 
 Cameron: I thought you started your vacation. 
 House: Somebody had to save our boss‚Äô rotundas ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus. 
 Foreman: Small buds in the lungs could indicate ‚Äì 
 House: Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù 
 Cuddy: Portable MRI‚Äôs in her room. We could get a current image ‚Äì 
 Chase: Fetal lungs are so tiny an MRI won‚Äôt give us the details we need. 
 House: What would we do if this patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person. 
 Cuddy: He‚Ä¶ is a person. 
 House: Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it‚Äôs a one pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what‚Äôs in the lungs? 
 Cameron: Transesophageal echo. 
 Chase: Can‚Äôt access his esophagus. 
 Foreman: Higher resolution CT could give us a clearer ‚Äì 
 Chase: To much radiation for a one pound person. 
 House: [Makes whining ‚Äúeheheheh‚Äù sound.] You can‚Äôt just sh**t everything down, Chase. You‚Äôre not me. Collaborate. 
 Chase: A ventilation perfusion scan would be next. [Foreman looks like he‚Äôs about to sh**t that one down.] 
 House: How do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope? Idiot. 
 Chase: If it were really a person and we had no other options, we‚Äôd do an exploratory surgery. Cut into his chest and have a look around. 
 House: Let‚Äôs do that. [He starts to leave, stopping next to Cuddy.] You‚Äôre the one who insists we treat it like a person. I‚Äôll put it back when I‚Äôm done. [He leaves.] 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs room. She has a ventilator mask on. House enters, followed by Cuddy.] 
 House: Me again. Your friendly neighborhood belly-squirter. [He hangs his cane from the IV pole and opens Emma‚Äôs gown over her belly and sits in bedside chair.] We‚Äôre going to do open fetal surgery. Open the uterus cut out the fetus so we can look around. I know you can‚Äôt talk so I need you to look petrified if you consent. 
 Cuddy: The umbilical cord won‚Äôt be cut. During surgery your body will basically serve as the baby‚Äôs heart-lung machine. We find what‚Äôs wrong and we fix it. If we can. 
 House: [out of corner of his mouth but at regular volume] Don‚Äôt lower expectations if you want them to do something. 
 Cuddy: She should know what she‚Äôs facing. [House is doing ultrasound of baby.] This is incredibly dangerous. It risks both your lives. The only reason why we‚Äôre suggesting it is because there‚Äôs nothing else we can do. 
 [House turns ultrasound monitor to Emma. She looks at it and tears drip from her right eye. She looks back at Cuddy and House and nods. Close-up of monitor with baby‚Äôs face clearly recognizable.] 
 [Cut to OR. House is gowned, gloved and masked.] 
 House: You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity. 
 [Cut to balcony where Wilson, Foreman, Chase and a couple of extras are observing. Periodic sh*ts of balcony during surgery but the main focus is on the OR.] 
 House: Mind each other‚Äôs personal space. There are sharp implements in the room. Like this one. [He holds up scalpel and starts to incise Emma‚Äôs belly.] Uterus is fully exposed. 
 Surgeon: And we‚Äôre in. Start draining the amniotic fluid. 
 [Resident inserts suction tube at top of womb. Slight sucking noise.] 
 House: Have you never sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg? Where‚Äôd you go to college? Gimme that. 
 [House inserts tube all the way in. Louder suction noise and he finishes quickly. As Cuddy, who is also suited up, watches, the baby‚Äôs hand falls out of the opening in the womb and lands on House‚Äôs left forefinger. The hand is about the size of the first joint of his finger. He raises his hand slightly and the baby‚Äôs hand moves, the fingers curling slightly around his finger. He touches it with his thumb. ] 
 Cuddy: Affix the pulse ox to the palm. [He continues to look at the hand and stroke it with his thumb.] House. 
 House: Sorry. I just realized I forgot to TiVo ‚ÄúAlien.‚Äù [He attaches paper, presumably the pulse ox, to the baby‚Äôs hand.] 
 Cuddy: Fetal heart rate good, stats are stable. 
 House: Position him for the incision. 
 Surgeon: All right, I see three well-defined lesions. It‚Äôs definitely CCAM. I should be able to resect them. [Monitor starts beeping.] 
 House: It‚Äôs the mom. She‚Äôs in V-fib. 
 Cuddy: [grabbing paddles] Charging. Clear. 
 Surgeon: I‚Äôm clear. [Cuddy shocks Emma. Everyone looks at monitor.] 
 House: Looks like asystole. Paddling‚Äôs not going to do anything. 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs fine V-fib. I‚Äôm going again. [Monitor still flat.] 
 House: We‚Äôre going to lose them both. Clamp! The surgery‚Äôs not doing this to her, the fetus is. [He starts to clamp the umbilical cord.] 
 Cuddy: Step away, House. I‚Äôm going again. 
 House: The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down. [He starts to cut the cord.] 
 Cuddy: You keep going, you‚Äôre going to get electrocuted. [He jumps back just as Cuddy shocks Emma again.] Going again. Clear. [And again. The monitor starts beeping normally.] 
 Surgeon: Heart rate‚Äôs returning to normal. 
 Cuddy: Continue with the lobectomy. [Cuddy and House look at each other.] 
 [Cut to PPTH exterior, night.] 
 [Cut to Emma‚Äôs room. House is examining her.] 
 Emma: So my kidney, liver and lungs are all fine, just like that? 
 House: Just like that. 
 Emma: That‚Äôs amazing. 
 House: What‚Äôs amazing is how blond your baby‚Äôs hair is. 
 Emma: [laughing] My baby? 
 House: You know, the thing in your belly that tried to k*ll you. 
 Emma: You‚Äôve never called him a baby before. 
 House: [stares at her] Any pain? 
 Emma: Nothing I can‚Äôt deal with. 
 House: You can only get out of bed to pee, poo or shower. And absolutely no sex. So stop flirting with me. [He takes a Vicodin.] 
 Emma: Sorry. So this really worked. He‚Äôll be‚Ä¶ normal? 
 House: Um. If you call being born twice, normal. [He gets up to leave.] 
 Emma: Hey, thank you. 
 House: Don‚Äôt thank me. I would have k*lled the kid. 
 [Cut to Cameron putting Emma‚Äôs cameras in her bag. Chase stands in doorway.] 
 Chase: Wanna grab a bite? 
 Cameron: In a minute. Emma asked me to bring up her camera. 
 Chase: I‚Äôll walk with you. [She sees the picture Emma took of Chase looking at Cameron‚Äôs picture.] 
 Cameron: When‚Äôd she take this picture of you? You look so‚Ä¶ 
 Chase: I‚Äôm smiling. I have a nice smile. 
 Cameron: No. I‚Äôve never seen you like this. She got you to‚Ä¶ glow. What were you doing? What‚Äôd she say to you? 
 Chase: I always glow. [He takes the bag as they walk down the hall.] 
 [Cut to House walking past the clinic on his way out.] 
 Cuddy: House. Need you to take a look at something. 
 House: I‚Äôm off the clock. 
 Cuddy: Just open it. [Hands him envelope.] 
 House: [pulls something out] First class ticket to Vancouver Island. 
 Cuddy: sh**t. It‚Äôs the wrong envelope. [She giggles.] I think it‚Äôs great. 
 House: Yeah. Who doesn‚Äôt like Canadians? 
 Cuddy: It‚Äôs big. You‚Äôre ‚Äì you‚Äôre trying to have a life. You‚Äôre trying to enjoy yourself. 
 House: You didn‚Äôt need to apologize. 
 Cuddy: I‚Äôm not. I told you why I‚Äôm ‚Äì 
 House: You screwed up. 
 Cuddy: I saved a life. I saved two lives. 
 House: You let your maternal instinct get the best of you and nearly k*lled two people. In a case like this you terminate and mom lives 10 times out of ten. You do what you did, mom and baby both die 9.9 times out of 10. 
 Cuddy: Sometimes point 1 is bigger than 9.9. 
 House: No. It‚Äôs smaller. Exactly 9.8 smaller. Always is, always will be. 
 Cuddy: Well, not for Emma. And not for her son. Now go away. And be happy. 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs home. He closes door and drops keys on the table to his left and his backpack to his right. He pulls out the ticket while hooking his cane on the molding over the entry arch and leans back against the door. After tapping the ticket a couple of times, he rips it in half and tosses it by his keys. As he enters the living room, he takes off his jacket and takes the phone off the hook. He sits on the couch and picks up the TV remote which is on a pile of journals and turns on the TV. He leans back on the couch and takes a Vicodin. The program seems to be about the Galapagos Islands. House watches, rubbing his left thumb against his fingers as if remembering the feel of the baby‚Äôs hand.] 
 [Cut to some point in the future. Emma is hanging pictures of Foreman, Cameron/Chase and Cuddy. The baby cries and she goes to him. Her home is the loft where the opening photo sh**t took place. She picks up the baby who seems to be full term.]",[' slightly] I‚Äôm not gonna let you k*ll my baby. \n House: It‚Äôs k*lling you. \n Emma: I‚Äôm not having an abortion. \n House: It‚Äôs not a baby.

house_4_1,412142,4,1,"[Megan's office. Day. Megan Bradberry walks through the office, cradling her cell phone on her shoulder, talking to her boyfriend, Ben Prosner.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Yeah, I said I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling too hot. 
 INTERCUT WITH: [Office Parking Lot. Day. Ben Prosner gets out of his car, speaking to her.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] You're sneezing. You can do that at a movie theatre. 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Yeah, and I'll be in a nice old chair when I collapse. I'm exhausted, babe. 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] Oh, come on! We're gonna be late! Episode Four never comes to the big screen. This is the pre-Lucas-ised version, remember? None of that ""Greedo sh**ting first"" crap. 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Go without me. 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] What are you talking about? You love Star Wars. [uncertain] Don't you? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Ben... 
 [She hands a sheet of paper to a spectacled lady sitting at her cubicle.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone, scandalized] Since when? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Since just before I started pretending I loved it. 
 [He lets out a loud sigh.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] I'm sorry. I was just trying to be supportive. 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone, shortly] Fine. I'll go alone. 
 [He hangs up, peeved.] 
 [She hangs up as well, shaking her head.] 
 [He stands a while, sighing. He takes a look at the office building (where she works). He thinks for a second or two...] 
 [Her phone rings, as she walks between cubicles. She answers it.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone, sincere] Baby, I'm sorry. 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Me too. I'm so woozy I can hardly think. 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] We'll hang out at home. 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] No, you should go. 
 [Suddenly, there's a rumbling sound and the office starts to shake. Big ripples appear in the water cooler bottle. She looks around, warily.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Did you just feel something? 
 [Outside, the place is still. Ben looks around, confused.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] Feel? Like what? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Is there an earthquake? 
 [She sees someone's hula girl toy, perched on top of a cubicle wall, swaying.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] In New Jersey? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Oh, God. 
 BEN PROSNER: [into phone] What? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] I think I'm, like... 
 [A ceiling light starts to flicker, while the ceiling itself starts to break apart.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] ...hallucinating. 
 [The hula girl toy is now rocking back and forth like crazy. The water in the cooler bottle is now splashing around heavily. The ceiling starts to shake harder, while the light flickers on and off.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [scared, into phone] Call 911. 
 [The ceiling light falls out.] 
 [A loud scream is heard, as Ben watches in horror as the office building explodes from inside. A huge cloud of dust and debris flies towards him, as he falls back, covering himself. When the dust finally settles, Ben, covered in dust and covering his mouth with his jacket, stands up slowly. A car alarm sounds in the background. Papers fly everywhere. Ben looks horrified at the collapsed building. The camera pans upwards, past the twisted metal and debris, and focuses on the dusty hula girl toy, still swaying.] 
 [Aerial View of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH). Day. A really loud and pretty well-played guitar riff is heard.] 
 [House's Office. Day. Dr. Gregory House tries to bring the house down (idiomatically) with a new V-shaped electric guitar, connected to an amplifier. He continues to play as his patient, yet long-suffering boss, Dr. Lisa Cuddy, tries to get through to him.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Twenty-six-year-old female, gas main exploded under her building, she was pulled out of the rubble after six hours. 
 [House couldn't care less. He plays the same loud guitar riff again, drawing annoyed stares (like he gives a crap) from passers-by. ] 
 LISA CUDDY: [continuing when he's done] Two surgeries for multiple fractures and burns. 
 GREG HOUSE: I'm thinking the broken bones are a response to the building falling on her head. [gives her a ""but-I-could-be-wrong"" shrug] 
 [He continues playing. She walks up.] 
 LISA CUDDY: And the fever? She's the only collapse victim whose body temperature... 
 GREG HOUSE: [interrupting] Put her on antipyretics. 
 [He continues playing the guitar. Cuddy patiently waits for him to stop. She speaks when he does.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Already have. The fever's holding at a hundred-and-four. Fluctuating consciousness. 
 GREG HOUSE: Can't take the case. I don't have a team. 
 LISA CUDDY: [smilingly holds up a file of r√©sum√©s] So hire a team. 
 GREG HOUSE: What for? I don't have a case. 
 [She puts the file on his desk.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Have you even interviewed anybody? 
 GREG HOUSE: You test drive a car before you buy it. You have sex before you get married. I can't hire a team based on a ten-minute interview. What if I don't like having sex with them? 
 [He lower-lip-pouts and twangs the guitar (quite funny). He starts to play again. She walks over to the amplifier and yanks out the cable, effectively stopping the rendition.] 
 LISA CUDDY: You've spent the last two weeks doing absolutely nothing. Concert is over. 
 GREG HOUSE: In what twisted universe does mastering Eddie Van Halen's two-handed arpeggio technique count as absolutely nothing? 
 LISA CUDDY: [threatening] Take the case or you will spend the next month helping the collapse team change bandages. 
 [Resigned, House looks down.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [betting] I diagnose her... alone... by the end of the day, you go away for a week. 
 LISA CUDDY: Done. 
 [She dangles the guitar cable in front of him, almost daring him to keep playing now. He takes it and she walks out. He shakes the lead at her as she leaves and throws the cable aside.] 
 [Cuddy's Office. Day. Cuddy speaks to House's long-suffering (and only) friend, Dr. James Wilson, about the bet.] 
 JAMES WILSON: It's not gonna work. 
 LISA CUDDY: If he solves the case, we cure the girl. 
 JAMES WILSON: And prove he doesn't need a team. 
 LISA CUDDY: He's not gonna solve the case. Not that fast. 
 JAMES WILSON: Why not? 
 LISA CUDDY: [insisting] Because he needs a team! And this'll prove to him... 
 JAMES WILSON: You wanna change his mind about something, you need a more convincing argument than ""You promised."" 
 [They look at each other.] 
 [Diagnostics Office (adjoining House's Office). Day. House writes ""FEVER"" on his beloved whiteboard.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [announcing as he writes] Fever. Non-responsive to antibiotics and antipyretics. 
 [He writes ""FL. CONSC."".] 
 GREG HOUSE: Fluctuating consciousness. Go! 
 [He turns around to an empty table. Duh! He sighs and snaps the lid on the marker.] 
 LEON THE JANITOR: [vo] You talking to me? 
 [House turns and sees a heavy-set, balding janitor (Leon the Janitor) in his office, with his cleaning stuff.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [thinks a sec] Yes. 
 [Leon sits in front of House, as House analogizes the case with his understanding of janitorial duties.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Imagine that... the roof of the storage closet collapses on your favorite... [seeing the spray bottle in Leon's hand] floor buffer. Which then starts overheating. 
 LEON THE JANITOR: Why would I have a favorite floor buffer? 
 [House gives him a ""Because..."" look.] 
 LEON THE JANITOR: Okay. [thinks] Maybe the electrical works got banged up in there from stuff falling on it. 
 GREG HOUSE: Hmm, interesting. Brain damage leading to hypothalamic dysregulation. 
 [He turns to write it on the whiteboard, but stops.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Nah. If you're brought in covered in rubble, it's all about the MRIs. We'd have seen that. [clapping his hands] C'mon! Gotta earn that fiver. 
 LEON THE JANITOR: [pointing to the spray] Or stuff leaked in the holes, messing it up. 
 GREG HOUSE: Lacerations leave multiple portals for infection. Bacteria would've responded to the antibiotics. 'S too high for viral. 
 [He starts to write on the 'board.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [as he writes] Parasites or fungus is possible. 
 LEON THE JANITOR: Or maybe lupus. 
 [House stops writing and sh**t him a questioning look.] 
 LEON THE JANITOR: Grandma has lupus. 
 [House shrugs and starts to write again.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [writing] Okay, autoimmune. I'll run a lupus panel. Infection fits best. Complete history would be helpful. Which leads to the worst part of the job. 
 [He takes his cane off the board and turns to Leon.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Dealing with the floor buffer's family. 
 [He looks at Leon and frowns, an idea forming in his twisted mind.] 
 [Megan's Room. Day. House speaks to Megan's mother, while Ben stands nearby.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: We talked every couple of weeks, but Ben would know better than I... 
 BEN PROSNER: No farms, no travel anywhere weird. 
 GREG HOUSE: You get that, Dr. Buffer? 
 [Camera pans off Ben to ""Dr. Buffer"", or should we say, Leon the Janitor in a lab coat.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": No travel, no farm. 
 GREG HOUSE: The file says she was sick before the building collapsed. 
 [House looks at Megan's unconscious form on the bed, her face d*sfigured horribly. Her left eye is stitched shut, her cheeks are swollen, her mouth has multiple stitches on it. She breathes through a respirator.] 
 BEN PROSNER: I figured it was just a cold. Why, do you think's related? 
 GREG HOUSE: Her being sick and her being sick? Often is. 
 BEN PROSNER: She was unconscious when I found her. 
 [House flashes a pen light in her eye.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [hesitates] We'd been fighting. I just wanna... Just tell me she's gonna be okay. 
 GREG HOUSE: [as cruel as he can be] I'm not even sure you're gonna be okay. 
 [Ben looks down in grief. ""Dr. Buffer"" walks forward and gently places his hand on Ben's shoulder, much to House's surprise.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": [sympathetic] We're gonna make her all better. 
 [Ben nods in gratitude. House looks at the touching moment, almost nauseous.] 
 [PPTH Hallway. Day. House and ""Dr. Buffer"" walk.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Show-off. 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": You oughta be nicer to people. 
 [House gives him a dubious look.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": Where are we going? 
 [House pulls the stethoscope off ""Dr. Buffer's"" neck.] 
 GREG HOUSE: You know how the laughter of little children is infectious? Well, parasites and fungi are even more so. We're gonna find out which one is making her brain bubble over. 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": Where, the building? 
 GREG HOUSE: EPA's doing that job for us. They say it's clean. Which means we're making a pilgrimage to Castle Blackberry. 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": [checking the file] Her name's Bradberry. I should ask them for keys. 
 GREG HOUSE: No need. I'm sure we can find a large rock somewhere. 
 [""Dr. Buffer"" stops walking.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": I'm not breaking into somebody's house. 
 [House stops and turns towards him.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": I got principles. 
 GREG HOUSE: [patting his pocket] I got some loose change here says you don't. 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": [shaking his head] I'm not doing this... for less than a fifty. 
 [House drops his head and looks at ""Dr. Buffer"".] 
 [House's Car. Day. Handheld camera inside the car. House drives, with Wilson as his passenger. They drive through the suburbs.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Where's the restaurant? 
 GREG HOUSE: What restaurant? 
 JAMES WILSON: The one you said you were taking me to for lunch. 
 GREG HOUSE: Oh. [points to one house] Uhhh, this one's homier. Dibs on the cold pizza. 
 [Wilson looks bewildered. House fixes his Disability card under his rear-view mirror.] 
 [Outside Megan and Ben's home. Day. House and Wilson stand outside, while House tries to jimmy the lock.] 
 JAMES WILSON: I'm sure it looked easier on YouTube. 
 [House has no success with the lock. He stands up and takes his cane from Wilson. He looks around for witnesses and then, breaks the window (near the lock) with the cane.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Oops. 
 [Putting his arm through the broken window, he unlocks the door.] 
 [Megan and Ben's home, kitchen. House opens a cabinet, looks around and shuts it. Sitting on his haunches, he opens the cabinet underneath the washbasin and looks around. Wilson walks up, complaining.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Yeah, you don't need a team. You can't even get arrested without company. 
 GREG HOUSE: You're right. Only one solution. Never replace 'em. Ever. 
 JAMES WILSON: Do you need help? 
 [House grimaces in pain.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Yeah, yeah, patronize the poor cr*pple. 
 [He tries to move.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [wincing] Ow. 
 JAMES WILSON: Lemme... get that. 
 GREG HOUSE: I got it. 
 [Wilson kneels down and reaches for House's cotton swab.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Will you... let me... just let me get it. 
 [House hands him the swab and turns around, trying not to smile. He stands upright, smiling victoriously.] 
 GREG HOUSE: I'll check the bedroom. 
 [Megan and Ben's home, bedroom. House jumps onto the bed and lies down comfortably.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [calling out, as if hard at work] Some interesting mold on the windowsill here! It's gonna take me a while. 
 JAMES WILSON: [resigned] I'll cover the bathroom. 
 [Still on the bed, House looks at some books (""Zodiac Signs"", ""The Princess and the Wolf"") on the nightstand nearby. He has a thought and props his head up. He turns his head towards the bookcase. He looks at the books, neatly standing on the shelves - except for one (""Old Bug""), which juts out halfway. He gets up off the bed and limps towards the bookcase. He removes the ""Old Bug"" book and pulls out another one (hidden behind it). He opens it, finding handwritten text inside.] 
 [Megan and Ben's home, kitchen. Wilson sits at the counter, cutting up a newspaper, when House enters, reading the book he unearthed.] 
 GREG HOUSE: She had a secret diary. 
 JAMES WILSON: Is there any other kind? 
 GREG HOUSE: What're you doing? 
 JAMES WILSON: There's a sale on Liquid Tide. 
 GREG HOUSE: If you're broke, I can lend you a tiny bit of the money I owe you. 
 JAMES WILSON: No, no, I wouldn't put you in that position. What does the diary say? 
 GREG HOUSE: It's basically a list of her sexual encounters. Boys, girls, vibrating appliances. 
 JAMES WILSON: If it was, you'd be quoting, not summarizing. 
 GREG HOUSE: [reading the diary] This is a parade of sad banalities. ""I can hardly get out of bed. Feeling blue."" Then, three months ago, turns into a parade of happy banalities. ""Starting to turn the corner. Job's looking up."" 
 JAMES WILSON: We can stop swabbing. Her clich√©s are getting healthier. 
 GREG HOUSE: Or she's less depressed. Aren't there pills that do that? 
 JAMES WILSON: Antidepressants don't cause fever. 
 GREG HOUSE: Not on their own. But the ER Didn't know she was on MAO Inhibitors, so they gave her demerol. 'S a nasty combo. 
 JAMES WILSON: So all you have to do is convince this kid that his girlfriend had a secret doctor, and a secret stash, and a secret life. It's been a while since a patient took a swing at you. Can I watch? 
 [He picks up a box of chips.] 
 GREG HOUSE: I only have to convince the mother. [thinks] Actually... I don't have to convince anyone. 
 [He puts a few chips in his mouth.] 
 [Megan's Room. Day. Ben speaks to someone offscreen (who just told him the news).] 
 BEN PROSNER: This it total crap. If she was seeing a psychiatrist, I'd know. If she was on dr*gs, I'd know. 
 [Camera pans from him to Leon, sorry, ""Dr. Buffer"" and Mrs. BradBerry.] 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": [holding out the consent form] Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the form so we can start the dialysis. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: But why antidepressants? I don't understand. 
 ""DR. BUFFER"": [repeats] Mrs. Bradberry, please sign the form so we can start the dialysis. 
 BEN PROSNER: Stop saying that. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Dr. Buffer, what is going on? What aren't you telling us? 
 [""Dr. Buffer"" wonders what to say.] 
 [Cuddy's Office. Day. The outraged mother and boyfriend speak to an equally-outraged Cuddy (behind her desk), while House lounges sheepishly nearby.] 
 BEN PROSNER: He's a janitor? 
 GREG HOUSE: More significantly, a blabbermouth. 
 [Cuddy moves her Dell flatscreen monitor out of the way, so she can see him.] 
 LISA CUDDY: House, shut up! I am... very sorry how Dr. House handled this. It is completely unforgivable. 
 [House gives her a look.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [uneasy] Except if he's right. 
 [Mrs. Bradberry frowns at her.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Dialysis will filter her blood. 
 BEN PROSNER: [firm] There's nothing to filter. 
 LISA CUDDY: Save her life. 
 BEN PROSNER: She wasn't depressed. 
 GREG HOUSE: ""I'm miserable around Ben."" 
 [Ben whirls around to look at him.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Not me. I like Ben. [pulling out the diary] February 12th. [tosses it to Ben] Either she's depressed, or she just thinks you're a jerk. Neither suggests that you should be the one directing her medical treatment. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Does the diary say my daughter's taking these dr*gs? 
 GREG HOUSE: No, but medically... 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [interjecting] Did you find dr*gs in their home? 
 GREG HOUSE: She's probably hiding them in her purse. [stands] I thought it'd be rude to go searching under a thousand tons of rubble. 
 [Meanwhile, Ben has been reading through the diary. He looks up.] 
 BEN PROSNER: This was months ago. We were in a fight. Doesn't mean she's depressed and it doesn't mean she doesn't love me. 
 GREG HOUSE: Fine, maybe the diary proves nothing. On the other hand, half the country's on antidepressants. And it fits her symptoms perfectly. 
 [Ben and Mrs. Bradberry look at each other.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [to Mrs. Bradberry] No ring on your daughter's finger means you make the decisions. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [stammers] I-I'm not sure... that I know her well enough anymore. 
 GREG HOUSE: You really wanna risk her life on how well _he_ knows her? 
 [Ben looks down. Mrs. Bradberry looks at him.] 
 [House's Office. Day. House triumphantly enters and limps towards his desk. Immediately, he puts on the amplifier and turns the volume up. The amplifier lets out a hum. He goes over to the guitar stand and finds it empty! Surprised, he looks around. He follows the amplifier cable along the floor, up past his computer and sees the lead taped to the wall, under a note, which has letters cut out from newspapers and magazines. Understanding, he walks up to the note. It reads: 
 I Have Your guitar 
 Tell No one 
 AWaiT MY inSTRUCTIONS 
 His phone rings. He answers it, speaking first.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] Wilson, you idiot. 
 [An electronically-masked voice speaks.] 
 THE GUITARNAPPER: [from phone] Listen carefully, and no one will get hurt. 
 [House drops the receiver on his table and st*lks out.] 
 THE GUITARNAPPER: [from phone] You must follow these instructions. 
 [Wilson's Office. Day. Wilson, AKA The Guitarnapper, speaks into his receiver, with a small bonesaw in front of the mouthpiece.] 
 JAMES WILSON: [deep voice, into phone] Any attempt to contact the FBI or other law enforcement agencies, or... Cuddy, will be met with... 
 [House busts inside. Wilson quickly stops the saw and speaks normally into the mouthpiece.] 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone] ...and a large Coke. No ice. 
 [He hangs up.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Give it back. 
 JAMES WILSON: [innocently] What happened? 
 [House throws his head up in annoyance.] 
 JAMES WILSON: [melodramatic] Did someone... kidnap your guitar? 
 [House starts to look around the place.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Your twelve-thousand-dollar 1967 Flying V? Or something? 
 GREG HOUSE: Where'd you hide it? 
 [Wilson holds up the newspaper to read it.] 
 JAMES WILSON: I'm flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant. 
 GREG HOUSE: Yeah, it takes a cr... 
 [He stops, seeing pieces missing from Wilson's newspaper.] 
 GREG HOUSE: It takes a criminal mastermind to pull off a heist from an unlocked, unguarded room down the hall. What do you want? 
 JAMES WILSON: [bright-eyed] Me? Nothing. But I'm sure the kidnapper wants what every kidnapper wants. To see you interview five to seven well-qualified fellowship candidates. 
 GREG HOUSE: [stubborn] I don't need a team. 
 JAMES WILSON: You were bouncing ideas off a janitor. 
 GREG HOUSE: [victorious] And solved the case! 
 [He leaves. Wilson slaps the newspaper on his desk, irritated.] 
 [Megan's Room. While Mrs. Bradberry stands nearby, Cuddy leans over the bed, speaking to an awake Megan.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [gently] Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. If you can hear what I'm saying, blink once. 
 [Megan blinks. Mrs. Bradberry smiles in relief. Megan wheezes, trying to touch her throat with her bandaged hand. Cuddy gently moves her arm away.] 
 LISA CUDDY: You can't talk right now. You have a tube down your throat. And try not to move your head. You've been in a terrible accident. But it looks like you will have no permanent injuries. You've had a bad fever, but it's gone now. 
 BEN PROSNER: I've been here the whole time, honey, okay? 
 LISA CUDDY: This is very important. I need you to blink one for ""yes"", twice for ""no"". Were you seeing a psychiatrist? 
 [Megan blinks once.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Were you on MAO Inhibitors? The antidepressant. 
 [Blink. Mrs. Bradberry and Ben look at each other.] 
 BEN PROSNER: Megan, it's okay. Doesn't matter, okay? I love you. 
 [Megan starts to breathe heavily. The monitors start to beep rapidly.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [scared] Honey? Honey, what's wrong? 
 LISA CUDDY: Megan, are you all right? 
 BEN PROSNER: What's happening? Are we upsetting her? 
 LISA CUDDY: Heart is beating too fast. [to an approaching nurse] Get the family out of here. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [crying] Megan? Megan? 
 [Cuddy preps the defibrillator paddles.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Charging to two hundred. 
 [The nurse starts to usher a struggling Ben outside.] 
 BEN PROSNER: Meg, meg. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Megan. 
 [Cuddy places the paddles on Megan's chest.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Clear! 
 [Zap! Megan's chest lurches forward.] 
 [House's Office. Day. Cuddy (dressed almost conservatively) sits alone in the office, when House walks in (wearing his biker jacket and sunglasses). He enters slowly on seeing her.] 
 LISA CUDDY: We shocked her back into sinus rhythm, but she's still tachycardic. 
 GREG HOUSE: Fascinating. Equally fascinating is... why are you here? 
 LISA CUDDY: I was gonna leave you alone if you won the bet. [smiling] But you lost. 
 GREG HOUSE: I explained the fever. Which is all we were talking about. 
 [He picks up an envelope, on which cutouts of ""Dr."" and ""house"" are pasted. He opens it.] 
 GREG HOUSE: She confirmed the antidepressants. Go bet with someone else if you want to explain the heart problems. 
 LISA CUDDY: She confirmed them by winking. Maybe there was a cute guy across the room. 
 [House extracts a Polaroid from the envelope and sees it's a picture of his guitar, standing upright in a corner of a dreary room, with a copy of today's newspaper in front of it.] 
 GREG HOUSE: She got better when I treated her. Even I'm not that cute. 
 LISA CUDDY: Two unrelated symptoms, just a coincidence. Or... you're grasping at straws to avoid admitting you can't do this on your own. 
 GREG HOUSE: [putting the Polaroid on his desk] Fine, what explains the fever and persistent tachycardia? 
 [He walks towards the Diagnostics Office. Cuddy follows (almost Duckling-like).] 
 LISA CUDDY: Could be anything. Endocarditis. 
 GREG HOUSE: Nope. Fever, no infection. 
 LISA CUDDY: [thinking] Um... 
 GREG HOUSE: [hands her a marker] Keep going, you're doing great. 
 [He leaves. She drops her hands.] 
 [Wilson's Office. Day. Wilson sits at his desk, when House barges in.] 
 GREG HOUSE: You win. 
 JAMES WILSON: I don't believe you. 
 GREG HOUSE: I'm not gonna play this game. Just give me the damn r√©sum√©s. 
 [He holds his hand out for the files. Wilson calmly moves to get them.] 
 GREG HOUSE: And my guitar. 
 JAMES WILSON: [innocently] I don't have it. Although I did hear some plangent strumming from under that couch earlier. 
 [House turns and limps quickly over to Wilson's couch. He roughly moves it back and, finding nothing, turns to Wilson, an annoyed look on his face.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Wow. This kidnapper isn't just bold, he's diabolical. I guess he realized he probably shouldn't give it back to you until after you've had the interviews. 
 [He holds up the files of r√©sum√©s. Restraining himself, House grabs the files and walks out. Wilson looks smug.] 
 [Diagnostics Office. Day. Cuddy sits on the table, the whiteboard in front of her. House enters with the ransom r√©sum√©s. He notices the whiteboard's still blank. He goes round it and sees it's blank behind as well.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Huh! You didn't write anything. So what you're saying is, you didn't find that one big explanation... 'cause there isn't one. Clever. 
 LISA CUDDY: Well, let's just say, your antidepressant theory does explain the fever. What about the heart? And don't say a building fell on her. 
 GREG HOUSE: Okay... [clears his throat] A structure collapsed... 
 LISA CUDDY: Shut up. 
 GREG HOUSE: Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature releases potassium, causes V-Tach. 
 LISA CUDDY: You'd think she'd get Crush Syndrome after she was crushed, not two days later. 
 GREG HOUSE: Microvascular occlusions. Takes that long for the blood to reperfuse. 
 [Cuddy likes that idea.] 
 LISA CUDDY: She'd have a baggy heart. [tosses him the marker] Echo it to confirm. 
 [She walks out.] 
 [Megan's Room. Day. House performs an echo on Megan, while her mother and Ben stand close by.] 
 BEN PROSNER: Is Crush Syndrome good or bad? 
 GREG HOUSE: Does it sound good? 
 BEN PROSNER: I mean, compared to the other things it could be. 
 GREG HOUSE: There are no other things it could be. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Then why are you testing her? 
 GREG HOUSE: Excellent question. 
 [He looks at the image of the heart beating and frowns.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [apprehensively] What... what is it? 
 GREG HOUSE: The heart's fine. 
 BEN PROSNER: [looking at Megan] Why is she sweating? [looking at the monitor] Her fever's back. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Why would her fever be back? 
 GREG HOUSE: I can't say. 
 BEN PROSNER: You don't know? 
 GREG HOUSE: I know, just can't say. 'Cause you'll hit me. Let's discuss this in front of witnesses. 
 [Cuddy's Office. Day. House stands next to an ill-at-ease Cuddy, behind her desk, speaking to Ben and Mrs. Bradberry.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [incredulous] The DTs? 
 BEN PROSNER: So she's an alcoholic now? 
 GREG HOUSE: Her first fever was from the medication for her depression. 
 BEN PROSNER: Or you're wrong. 
 GREG HOUSE: The second fever was from the self-medication for depression. 
 BEN PROSNER: This is insane. [angrily] You don't think I would have noticed her being constantly drunk? 
 GREG HOUSE: [shrugs] You were practically living with Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that. 
 LISA CUDDY: [softly to him] Tone it down or I will hit you. 
 GREG HOUSE: Fine, I'll do liver enzyme tests. 
 LISA CUDDY: [whispers to him] Liver enzymes can also be elevated from musculoskeletal trauma. They'd be there whether she had a drinking problem or not. 
 GREG HOUSE: [whispers in mock-frustration] They don't know that. Just pretend to confirm. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: What's the treatment? 
 BEN PROSNER: [unrelenting] She's not an alcoholic. 
 GREG HOUSE: Hair of the dog, IV alcohol. Taper it off after a few days. 
 BEN PROSNER: She's sick and traumatized and half-dead. You wanna make her drunk. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [weakly] Just do it. 
 BEN PROSNER: [turning to her] You can't do this. We lived together, we were gonna have kids. You barely even knew her. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Apparently, neither did you. 
 [She walks off. Ben looks at Cuddy and House.] 
 [Aerial View of PPTH. Night.] 
 [House's Office. Might. House sits at his desk, in the darkened office, his face illuminated by a reading lamp. Putting on his glasses, he looks at a bunch of r√©sum√©s. Finding one that interests him, he calls the applicant.] 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone, upbeat] Hello? 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] Hi, could I speak to Trevor... [checks the r√©sum√©] Kaufman? 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone] Yo, yo, it's Trev. What up? 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] This is Dr. Gregory House. Can you come in tomorrow to interview? 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone] House? Are you serious? Awesome! [whispering to someone on his side] Hey, dude, I got the House interview! 
 [Trevor's roommate, who's either drunk or jealous, speaks.] 
 TREVOR'S ROOMMATE: [from phone] Ohh, look at me! I got the House interview! 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone] Dude, shut up! I'm on the phone! Shut-up! 
 TREVOR'S ROOMMATE: [from phone] I'm so cool! 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone] Give me the phone back. 
 TREVOR'S ROOMMATE: [from phone] Woooo! 
 TREVOR KAUFMAN: [from phone] Give me the phone back! 
 [House hangs up.] 
 [PPTH Nurse Station. Night. Wilson enters groggily, dressed in a sweatshirt. He approaches the Nurse Station, where a male nurse works on the computer.] 
 JAMES WILSON: I got a page. 
 MALE NURSE: No, you didn't. 
 JAMES WILSON: They called a code. 
 MALE NURSE: No, they didn't. 
 [Wilson sleepily holds up his beeper. The male nurse looks at it.] 
 MALE NURSE: [smiling] You got a page, but not from us. 
 [Wilson realizes he's been conned.] 
 [Wilson's Hotel Apartment. Night. House has broken inside (his second break-in today) and is busy ransacking the apartment, looking for his beloved guitar. The phone rings. House limps over and answers it.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] Did you ever see ""Raid on Entebbe""? 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone] Yeah, in the end, they released the hostages. How's that working for you? 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] The Ugandans played fair. They didn't move the hostages on the Israelis. 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone] Once again, I am in awe of the kidnapper's tactical brilliance. 
 [House switches on Wilson's TiVo.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] What is ""El Fuego Del Amor"" and why do you need ten of them? 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone, nervous] It's a Telenovela. I'm learning Spanish. 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone] Say adios. 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone, panicked] Are you erasing my TiVo? [pleading] House, not the season finale! 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone, Bronson-like] I don't negotiate with t*rrorists. I smoke them out of their hidey-holes. 
 [Pretty safe to assume, as House fiddles with the remote, Wilson will have to hope and wait for reruns.] 
 JAMES WILSON: [into phone] Do you know what t*rrorists do when you don't negotiate? [threatening] They terrorize. 
 GREG HOUSE: [into phone, challenging] Bring-it-on. 
 [Hanging up, he tosses the cordless receiver out the window.] 
 [Megan's Room. Night. Cuddy checks up on Megan, with Ben and Mrs. Bradberry keeping close watch.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Fever's down. Sweating has abated. Heart's working fine. Guess House was right. [hates saying it, but...] Again. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: That's good news, right? 
 LISA CUDDY: It is good news. 
 BEN PROSNER: So what does this mean, she's an alcoholic? There's no other explanation? 
 LISA CUDDY: [looks at Megan, quietly] No, sorry. 
 BEN PROSNER: It doesn't make any sense. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Dr. Cuddy, she's doing this thing with her mouth again. 
 [Cuddy looks at Megan to check.] 
 BEN PROSNER: It's been on and off for the last couple hours. Is she trying to talk? 
 Cuddy looks at Megan. She's shuddering like she's in pain.] 
 LISA CUDDY: No. I think she's screaming. 
 [Megan's silent screams continue.] 
 [Aerial View of PPTH. Next Morning.] 
 [PPTH Entrance/Lobby/Cuddy's Office. Cuddy enters, looking tired. House sidles up near her.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [cheerful] Morning! 
 LISA CUDDY: [reacts with a start] Uh-huh. Where did you come from? 
 [They stop at the Nurse's Station, for Cuddy to sign in.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Apes, if you believe the democrats. I heard you were there when I was proven right. The alcohol treatment took away the heart and fever problems. 
 LISA CUDDY: Yes, I was also there when you were proven wrong. She'd been silently screaming for two hours. 
 [She starts to walk towards her office. He follows.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Amylase and lipase are through the roof. She has pancreatitis. 
 GREG HOUSE: IV alcohol can cause pancreatitis. 
 LISA CUDDY: Okay. 
 [She enters her office. House looks puzzled. He follows her in.] 
 [In her office, Cuddy puts her bag on the table, removes her jacket and gets her labcoat. House limps inside.] 
 GREG HOUSE: You're not gonna argue with me? 
 LISA CUDDY: Nope. 
 GREG HOUSE: You think I'm right? 
 LISA CUDDY: Nope. 
 [She goes behind her desk.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Why not? 
 LISA CUDDY: Nope. 
 GREG HOUSE: It's not really a ""Yes or No"" question. 
 LISA CUDDY: Which is why I'm not answering it. 
 GREG HOUSE: If it's not the IV alcohol, it's gotta be the... 
 [She starts unpacking her bag, without looking at him.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [interjecting] Not interested. 
 GREG HOUSE: If I'm wrong, she's gonna die. Are you sure you're still Dean of Medicine? 
 [She looks at him.] 
 LISA CUDDY: I'm not interested in arguing because I'm not interested in enabling you. You need someone to bounce ideas off of. You need a team. 
 [She starts to walk out. House turns to follow.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Don't follow me. 
 [House starts dead in his tracks.] 
 [House's Office. Day. House sits at his desk, speaking to himself (or something).] 
 GREG HOUSE: [counting on his fingers] MAO Inhibitor caused the fever. Alcohol caused the pancreatitis. Alcohol withdrawal caused the V-Tach 
 [He looks at his Magic Eightball.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [reading] ""You're logic is irrefutable."" 
 LISA CUDDY: You're wrong. 
 [He looks up to see Cuddy entering.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Well, who're you gonna believe? A classic toy or a woman who, if she had any confidence in her ideas, wouldn't feel the need to distract you with a water bra? 
 LISA CUDDY: [ignoring the jibe] Are you really just gonna treat the pancreatitis? 
 GREG HOUSE: Are you here to enable me? 
 LISA CUDDY: I don't want her to die because you're stubborn. 
 GREG HOUSE: Wow, so you can enable and rationalize at the same time. Guess you are still Dean of Medicine. 
 [He picks up a parcel on his desk and starts opening it.] 
 LISA CUDDY: If you're right, then this guy, who's not an ass, who's not a workaholic, who's not a sociopath, has somehow missed both her depression and severe alcoholism. 
 GREG HOUSE: Yes, imagine that, a couple with secrets. 
 [He gets the parcel open and looks inside.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [insistent] Why would she lie? 
 [House's expression darkens when he sees the contents of the box.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [deadpan] Okay, alcoholism you don't wanna advertise. But... [notices House's shocked expression] 
 [House quickly picks up the box and his cane and starts to limp outside. Cuddy follows.] 
 LISA CUDDY: If you're right, there'd be an abnormality on the pancreas. At least do an MRI to confirm. 
 [They both walk outside.] 
 [Wilson's Office. Day. Wilson's at his desk, when House bursts inside, carrying the box, a look of anger on his face. He tosses the box onto Wilson's desk. Wilson looks innocently at him. House gives him a threatening glare. Wilson chances a look inside and reaches inside the box. He pulls out a severed arm... a tremolo arm of a guitar, with broken strings.] 
 JAMES WILSON: [in mock-disgust] Oh... my... God. 
 [He throws the arm back into the box, repulsed, and pushes the box away.] 
 JAMES WILSON: This guy means business. Or guys. Could be multiple... Could be multiple guys. Or a gal. Who knows? All I can say is, this reeks of boldness. 
 GREG HOUSE: [staring him down] I am not hiring a team. 
 [He starts to walk outside.] 
 JAMES WILSON: You ever tighten a guitar string really, really slowly? 
 [House stops at the door. 
 JAMES WILSON: Past the point it can handle the strain? It makes this weird... sound. 
 [House stares daggers at Wilson.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Almost like a scream. 
 [Wilson starts making low guttural sounds, like nails on a chalkboard. House storms off.] 
 [MRI Room. Day. Megan is inside the MRI, while House sits in the adjoining room, looking at the results. Wilson enters.] 
 JAMES WILSON: I thought this was gonna be fun. I mess with you, you mess with me. Eventually, you give in. But you've shown a startling lack of humor, which got me thinking. 
 GREG HOUSE: [mumbling] Oh, god. 
 JAMES WILSON: What's the real reason you won't hire a team? 
 GREG HOUSE: I told you, I don't need a team. 
 JAMES WILSON: Then hire three people and let 'em sit on their asses. 
 GREG HOUSE: That wouldn't be right. 
 JAMES WILSON: Three years ago, you hired a team. What's changed? 
 GREG HOUSE: I've become a man of principle. I've gotten smarter. What answer will make Socrates shut up? 
 JAMES WILSON: [Dr. Phil-son] What's changed is, you hired a team. You connected with a team. You worked with a team. And you lost a team. 
 GREG HOUSE: [looking at the monitor] Damn. There's no abnormalities in her pancreas. 
 JAMES WILSON: You fall in love, you get married. Fifty percent chance it'll end in misery. Hiring employees can be even tougher. Because you know, eventually, they're gonna leave. 
 GREG HOUSE: There's increased T2 signal on her hepatic capsule. [looking at Wilson] If you know what I mean. 
 JAMES WILSON: You got hurt. Get over it. 
 [Uninterested, House hits a key. Megan is slowly brought out of the MRI.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Now, if you'll excuse me, my patient is about to start bleeding out of her mouth and anus. 
 [He gets up and walks into the MRI room, while Wilson rolls his eyes. Sure enough, blood seeps down Megan's mouth and between her legs.] 
 [Operating Room. Day. Megan has been opened up. The surgeons and nurses work on her, cauterizing and stitching her bleeding organs. Cuddy watches from the Observation Deck above. House enters the Observation Deck.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Internal bleeding. 
 GREG HOUSE: Not anymore. Now it's all over the place. 
 LISA CUDDY: Why are you here? 
 GREG HOUSE: That's my patient down there. 
 LISA CUDDY: You're here because I'm here. [confidently] I am done enabling you. 
 GREG HOUSE: I know. 
 [They stand and watch the surgery in silence. Cuddy cracks first.] 
 LISA CUDDY: [without a pause] The alcohol didn't cause the pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did. The question is, what caused the internal bleeding? I hate myself. 
 GREG HOUSE: You do know that the patient had a building land on her. 
 LISA CUDDY: Four days ago. 
 GREG HOUSE: Bleeding can start at any time. 
 LISA CUDDY: It's bleeding from five different sites. You think they synchronized their watches? 
 GREG HOUSE: She got warfarin after her hip surgery. It's designed to mess with bleeding patterns. 
 LISA CUDDY: Fever, heart and bleeding. Three problems, three completely different explanations. She must be the unluckiest woman in the world. 
 GREG HOUSE: [dogged] I only cling to this crazy theory because it's been proven right every step of the way. Each treatment worked. 
 LISA CUDDY: [deadpan] Yes, she looks perfectly healthy. This much bleeding is a symptom of something more. And you need a team because you're wrong and you're gonna k*ll this woman. 
 [House looks up and sees the surgery in progress on the TV screen. He notices something.] 
 GREG HOUSE: If I had a team, this patient would be dead. Because they'd be here instead of me and they wouldn't notice the size of this woman's uterus. 
 [Cuddy turns to the screen.] 
 [In the OR, the doctors work on their patient. House enters, scrubbed up but without a mask.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Hi! How's it going? Mind if I observe? 
 SURGEON: [hardly bothered] Got a big room up top window just for that. 
 [House starts to push Megan's gown upwards, so he can... look. A nurse tries to put a surgical mask on his face, but he pushes her hand away.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Oh, stop that. 
 SURGEON: You wanna look at vaginas, there are websites for that. 
 [House pushes the gown up and goes to get something.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Am I made of money? 
 SURGEON: [to Cuddy, in the Observation Deck] Can you get him out of here? 
 [Cuddy doesn't say anything, she's equally curious. House inserts a scope... inside Megan.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Enlarged uterus. Means that she was recently pregnant. She's a good liar, but I doubt she could hide a baby from her boyfriend. 
 [He puts on a monitor and looks.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Scraping in the uterus indicates that she had an abortion. But nothing in her medical history. Only one reason to hide an abortion. Boyfriend wants babies, she doesn't. 
 SURGEON: She's bleeding everywhere. Unless the guy was performing an abortion with a shotgun... 
 LISA CUDDY: [over intercom] Stop enabling him! 
 GREG HOUSE: It's not the abortion, it's what she did after. The boyfriend would have noticed condoms. He would notice abstinence. He would not notice the pill. Which means, [to Cuddy] I don't need a team! 
 [Cuddy rolls her eyes.] 
 [Corridor outside OR. Day. Ben and another guy (who seems really sad) sit on a bench, near the morgue. House comes out of the OR and approaches them.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Hey, where's your mother-in-common-law? 
 BEN PROSNER: [stands, introduces the other guy] Dr. House, this is Doug McMurtry. His girlfriend was working with Megan when... [trails off] 
 GREG HOUSE: [to Doug] She's dead? 
 DOUB MCMURTRY: [choked voice] She passed this morning. 
 GREG HOUSE: Well, then why are you still here? 
 [Doug doesn't react (or he doesn't know how to react to that remark). House speaks to Ben.] 
 GREG HOUSE: I need the old lady's consent to do some treatment. 
 BEN PROSNER: What'd you find out? 
 GREG HOUSE: I wish I could tell you, but since you're not legally related... 
 [He turns to leave, but Ben grabs him by the arm.] 
 BEN PROSNER: What the hell did you did you find out? 
 GREG HOUSE: Your girlfriend had an abortion. See why I didn't tell you? I'd be insane to also tell you that she's on the pill. 
 BEN PROSNER: N-No, she's not. 
 GREG HOUSE: If they'd known she was on it, they wouldn't have given her a blood thinner after her hip surgery. The combination caused the bleeding. It's good news. It's treatable. Just give her tamoxifen. Which is normally a breast cancer... 
 BEN PROSNER: It's not true. 'Cause, uh, we wanna have kids. 
 GREG HOUSE: Hmm, I already did the blood tests. Either she lied to you, or her blood lied to us. 
 [Ben looks upset and stays quiet for a moment.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [sighs] Tell Megan I'm glad she's gonna be okay. 
 [He turns around and leaves. House and Doug remain.] 
 [Aerial View of PPTH. Evening.] 
 [Oncology Ward. Night. House juts his head through the curtain partition and speaks to an old cancer patient, Sam Lee, who's lying in bed, reading a book.] 
 GREG HOUSE: How ya doing? 
 SAM LEE: I got cancer. 
 GREG HOUSE: [entering] You're on an oncology ward. Everybody's got cancer. You want sympathy, you wanna try the ""hardly anything wrong with me"" ward. [drops his cane] In fact, why don't I take you there right now? 
 [He tries to move Mr. Lee's bed, but finds it's too heavy.] 
 GREG HOUSE: How sick are you? Can you walk? 
 [He grabs the patient's chart and looks at it.] 
 SAM LEE: [with trepidation] Are you a doctor? 
 [House starts to pull the bed upright.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [reading the chart] Admitted today. First day of a five-day chemo course. Yeah, you can walk. C'mon, let's go. 
 SAM LEE: Does Dr. Wilson know you're here? 
 GREG HOUSE: [smiling] Well, if he didn't, this would be really stupid. 'Cause then he wouldn't know where his patient was. [chuckling] Might think he'd been kidnapped. The room upstairs is bigger. It's got cable. Better looking sponge-bath nurses. 
 [Mr. Lee starts to get out of bed.] 
 SAM LEE: [intrigued] Oh. 
 GREG HOUSE: If you feel sick, you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson. He's getting his last set of hormone sh*ts. 
 [He ushers Mr. Lee out, who drags his IV line with him. House's pager starts to beep.] 
 [Outside Megan's Room. Night. Monitors beep. Doctors and nurses work on Megan, while her worried mother looks on. House limps hurriedly to the room. Cuddy comes out of the room to speak to him.] 
 LISA CUDDY: You put her on tamoxifen? An anti-cancer drug? 
 GREG HOUSE: It blocks estrogen receptors. 
 LISA CUDDY: Does it also block breathing and kidney function? She's crashing. 
 [House watches the doctors and nurses attending to Megan.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Doesn't mean I was wrong. 
 [Cuddy looks at him.] 
 [Emergency Room. Day. House limps inside the ER, where doctors and nurses move quickly attending to patients.] 
 DOCTOR: [into phone] Dr. Martin. We're bringing his patient over now, thanks. 
 GREG HOUSE: [shouting] Anybody here a doctor? [looks around, gets no answer] Kidney failure, spiking fever, breathing difficulties. Any theories? 
 [No one even looks at him. He looks around. Near him, a young lady doctor attends to a wailing, squirming woman on a gurney.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Am I in an M. Night Shyamalan movie? 
 [The young doctor looks at him.] 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: You're House, right? 
 GREG HOUSE: Okay, I assume you know me because I once insulted you, your patient, or your relatives. If that's so, I apologize. I was drunk that day. [back to work] Patient initially presented with crush injuries. 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: [interrupts] I know you because Dr. Cuddy issued a memo. 
 GREG HOUSE: [hopeful] Telling to cooperate fully with me? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: Nope. 
 GREG HOUSE: Figured that was a long shot. [shouts to the room] Anybody here not get that memo? 
 [The people ignore him. Thwarted, he leaves.] 
 [Corridor outside ER. Day. House exits the ER, limping into the corridor. As he limps, the young doctor comes up behind.] 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: Fungal infection. 
 [House turns around.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Don't you have a patient? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: She shot herself in the leg while high on meth. Wouldn't hurt her to be in pain for a little while. 
 GREG HOUSE: Fungal infection would be in her eyes by now. 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: [guesses] Haemophilus. 
 GREG HOUSE: Doesn't explain the remitting fever. 
 [She looks intrigued and thinks.] 
 GREG HOUSE: You've heard that I've got a job opening, right? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: I just care about people. [guesses] Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. 
 GREG HOUSE: ARDS doesn't explain anything. Except the breathing. If you care about people, you're not getting the job. 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: I was lying. Crush Syndrome. 
 GREG HOUSE: Doesn't explain the breathing. What was the problem with ARDS? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: Only explained the breathing. 
 GREG HOUSE: And the Crush Syndrome? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: It didn't explain the breathing. 
 GREG HOUSE: You a fan of symmetry? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: Sure. 
 GREG HOUSE: Weird. 'Cause your eyes are lopsided. And by eyes, I mean breasts. ARDS And Crush Syndrome, both reactions to severe trauma. Why can't she have both? 
 YOUNG DOCTOR: Because... [somberly] because then there's nothing we could do. 
 GREG HOUSE: Boy, you remind me of someone. 
 [He starts to limp away.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Send me your r√©sum√©. I'll put it on top of the pile that I'm... never gonna look at. 
 [She hangs back and exhales heavily.] 
 [Megan's Room. Day. House limps inside. He sees Ben sitting morosely on the other bed. Mrs. Bradberry gets up.] 
 BEN PROSNER: I couldn't leave. 
 GREG HOUSE: You don't seem like the type of person who would give up on giving up. 
 BEN PROSNER: [expressionless] I love her. 
 GREG HOUSE: You love somebody. Someone who didn't drink, who wanted to have babies. And wasn't miserable. 
 BEN PROSNER: I know she lied, but... 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: What are you doing? Why are you saying these things to him? 
 GREG HOUSE: The woman you love doesn't exist. This woman is dying. She has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Crush Syndrome. Her body's basically giving up. We can keep her on supportive dialysis and hope for the best. 
 [Ben and Mrs. Bradberry look downcast. House starts to write on Megan's chart, but notices something on her arm. He pushes back her sleeve, to expose a reddish lump on her arm.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Never mind. She has a lump on her arm. 
 [Ben stands.] 
 BEN PROSNER: [hopeful] Does that mean you're wrong? 
 GREG HOUSE: That would be good news for you guys. We'll know after the biopsy. 
 [He leaves, while the others go to see the life-saving lump on Megan's arm.] 
 [PPTH Lab. Day. Cuddy walks into the lab, where lab tech, Imelda, works.] 
 LISA CUDDY: Which patient is that? 
 IMELDA: [checking the file] Megan... 
 LISA CUDDY: House's patient. 
 IMELDA: Yep. 
 LISA CUDDY: Didn't you get my memo? 
 IMELDA: Sure. Got both memos. 
 LISA CUDDY: [under her breath, realizing] Both. [almost rhetorical] And the second memo said to ignore the first memo? 
 IMELDA: Yep. Seemed odd. Did an MRI and... 
 LISA CUDDY: [interrupts] 'Course you did. 
 [Cuddy starts to walk out, but turns.] 
 LISA CUDDY: What'd you find? 
 IMELDA: It's kind of freaky. She's got growths all over the place. 
 [Cuddy and Imelda look at the monitor, which shows the biopsy results. Lots of white oval spots, guess those must be the growths.] 
 [Megan's Room. Day. Cuddy explains the situation to Ben and Mrs. Bradberry (who seems at the end of her rope).] 
 BEN PROSNER: She's got tumors? 
 LISA CUDDY: Not exactly. The growths are eosinophilic granulomas. [hanging up an IV bag] They are usually from allergic reactions. I'm putting her on steroids. 
 [She starts to administer the IV drip to Megan.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Allergy to what? She doesn't have allergies. 
 LISA CUDDY: We don't know. Unfortunately, the only drug she's had enough of to have this kind of reaction is cephalosporin. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: And why is that unfortunate? 
 BEN PROSNER: Because she was on it two months ago. That's what you mean, right? She... took it for strep throat, so she can't be allergic to it. 
 LISA CUDDY: It would seem so. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [mad] What is this hospital doing to her? She has had three separate medical disasters! And now she's dying of an allergy she can't possibly have! 
 [Cuddy doesn't answer.] 
 [Diagnostics Office. Night. House sits alone in the darkened office, staring at the whiteboard, which is now filled with the different diseases, disorders or whatnot that Megan could have. He sits up, strokes his chin and keeps thinking.] 
 [Oncology Ward. Night. Wilson enters Mr. Lee's section of the ward, pushing the curtain aside.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Mr. Lee, I just have to check... 
 [He sees someone in the bed, covered with a blanket.] 
 JAMES WILSON: Sam? Are you okay? 
 [No answer. He lifts the blanket and, seeing who's under it, yanks it off gruffly. It's the same male nurse he spoke to earlier about getting paged.] 
 JAMES WILSON: What're you doing here? 
 MALE NURSE: I was taking a nap. 
 JAMES WILSON: Where's my patient? 
 [He stops, pretty much realizing who might know.] 
 [Diagnostics Office. Night. House is still thinking about Megan's condition, when Wilson enters.] 
 JAMES WILSON: You stole my patient. 
 GREG HOUSE: You kidnapped my guitar. 
 JAMES WILSON: Give him back. 
 GREG HOUSE: Only when you give her back. 
 JAMES WILSON: It's a ""she""? 
 GREG HOUSE: [scoffs] Well, it's certainly not a dude. 
 JAMES WILSON: [shouting] It's a guitar! You took a human being! 
 GREG HOUSE: Now who doesn't have a sense of humor? I'm monitoring the guy remotely. 
 JAMES WILSON: What are you, listening for the distant sound of screaming? 
 GREG HOUSE: The nurses know to call me. 
 JAMES WILSON: They don't know who he is! 
 GREG HOUSE: His name's right there on the chart. Now go away. I'm working. 
 JAMES WILSON: They give him the wrong meds, who the hell knows what's gonna happen? 
 [""Lightbulb Moment"". In other words, House has an epiphany.] 
 JAMES WILSON: House! 
 GREG HOUSE: [murmuring] Bad things would happen. 
 [He starts to walk out.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [to Wilson, as he leaves] He's in room three-one-eight. 
 [Megan's Room. Night. Ben and Mrs. Bradberry watch Megan. House enters, carrying a file. He tosses the file on the bed, next to Megan. He starts to inject something into one of her IV lines.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [anxiously] What are you... what are you giving Megan? 
 GREG HOUSE: Megan? Nothing. 
 BEN PROSNER: Nothing? What's going on? What's wrong with her? 
 GREG HOUSE: Her? Nothing. 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: Then why are you giving her dr*gs? 
 GREG HOUSE: Just some amphetamines to wake her up. Everything could be explained by her lying to you. The antidepressants, the drinking, the pill. Until now. Now she's allergic to something the chart says she's not allergic to. That's not her lying, that's the chart lying. Which doesn't make sense. 
 [A beat.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Do you know a Liz Masters? 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: No. 
 BEN PROSNER: Yeah, she worked with Megan. That was her boyfriend who you met outside the morgue. 
 GREG HOUSE: Hmm. [holds up the file he brought in] This is her chart. [reading the chart] She's on MAO Inhibitors for depression. She's on the pill. She had an abortion a month ago. And she's allergic to cephalosporin. 
 BEN PROSNER: [apprehensive] What's going on here? What, are you saying this isn't Megan? 
 [Mrs. Bradberry looks worriedly at House. House looks at the patient.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Yes. 
 FLASHBACK: [Megan's Office. Day. Megan speaks to Ben on her cell phone.] 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Ben. 
 BEN PROSNER: [from phone] Since when? 
 MEGAN BRADBERRY: [into phone] Since right before I began pretending I loved it. 
 [She hands a sheet of paper to a spectacled lady sitting at her cubicle. The lady is Liz Masters.] 
 GREG HOUSE: She's the same size as Megan, same build, same hair color. 
 FLASHBACK: [Camera zooms towards Megan. Camera zooms towards Liz.] 
 GREG HOUSE: They were both horribly injured. Unrecognizably. EMT teams do not second guess family members' identifications at accident scenes. 
 [Mrs. Bradberry starts to sob. Ben, as usual, refuses to believe it.] 
 BEN PROSNER: No. Liz died yesterday. This isn't Liz. I know Megan. I know her hair. I know her hands. I know her smell. Oh. 
 [House removes the respirator from the patient's throat and covers the tube into her throat with his finger. She breathes heavily.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [to the patient] What's your name? 
 [Ben and Mrs. Bradberry wait nervously for the answer.] 
 LIZ MASTERS: [hoarsely] Liz... 
 [Ben covers his mouth in grief.] 
 MRS. BRADBERRY: [anguished] Oh, God! 
 [They move away and cry. House starts to limp away.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [to Ben, as he leaves] Your girlfriend never lied to you. 
 [Ben cries silently, looking back at House and then at Liz.] 
 [Liz Masters' Room. Night. Liz lies in bed. Doug McMurtry comes inside and slowly walks over to the bed. He holds Liz's heavily-bandaged hand gently and looks at her tearfully. Slowly, she opens her eyes and blinks at him once.] 
 [Hospital Morgue. Night. Ben grieves silently over the real Megan's body. Mrs. Bradberry stands outside, her eyes closed in sorrow.] 
 [House's Office. Day. House, his back to the door, plays with a rubber band. The door opens.] 
 GREG HOUSE: I did it all by myself, mommy. 
 LEON THE JANITOR: You talking to me? 
 [House turns and sees Leon, standing at the door, a dustbin in his hand.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Go away. 
 [Leon leaves. House resumes playing with the rubberband. The door opens again.] 
 GREG HOUSE: [chances it again] I did it all by myself, mommy. 
 [This time, he's got it right. Cuddy stands at the door.] 
 LISA CUDDY: How'd you know it was me? 
 GREG HOUSE: There's a scent given off by wounded, feral cats. 
 LISA CUDDY: [entering] You were wrong. 
 GREG HOUSE: I got everything right. Just treated the wrong... 
 LISA CUDDY: [interrupts] They had a good relationship. 
 GREG HOUSE: He couldn't even identify her. 
 LISA CUDDY: And you were wrong about needing a team. She almost died. 
 GREG HOUSE: So I almost need a team. 
 LISA CUDDY: You were content with your ""people are idiots"" theory. But Cameron would never have accepted that this guy knew nothing about the love of his life. And as soon as you claimed it was multiple conditions, Foreman would have done anything to prove you wrong. And then, Chase would have done anything to prove you right. Any one of them would have solved this days ago. Hire a team. I don't care how you do it. Just do it. 
 [She plops a whole stack of r√©sum√©s on his desk and leaves. He seems to think that she's right. He picks up one of the r√©sum√©s.] 
 [PPTH Training Room. Day. House strums his beloved guitar (with an unharmed tremolo arm) as he addresses a room full of prospective Ducklings. ECU of his hand and face.] 
 GREG HOUSE: Sometimes, I am wrong. I have a gift for observation. For reading people in situations. But sometimes, I am wrong. This will be the longest job interview of your life. I will test you in ways that you will often consider unfair, demeaning and illegal. And you will often be right. Look to your left. Now look to your right. By the end of six weeks, one of you will be gone. As will twenty-eight more of you. [beat, ominously] Wear a cup. 
 [With a flourish, he twangs his guitar. The loud sound emanating from the amplifier gives the unfortunate Duckling-hopefuls a start.]","[' \n [He puts on a monitor and looks.] \n GREG HOUSE: Scraping in the uterus indicates that she had an abortion.

house_4_10,412142,4,10,"[Pan over the Christmas-theme decorated ceiling of a rock climbing center. Zoom in on a girl who‚Äôs climbing, belayed by her mother on the ground.] 
 MAGGIE: You ok? 
 JANE: I‚Äôm thinking. 
 MAGGIE: Thinking‚Äôs not going to get you to the top. 
 JANE: [out of breath] Mom, you‚Äôre supposed to be encouraging me. 
 MAGGIE: No, I‚Äôm supposed to be coaching you. The slower you go, the more tired you‚Äôre going to get. 
 [Jane cringes and then reaches for another rock, successfully grabbing on and continuing upwards. Maggie smiles proudly.] 
 MAGGIE: There‚Äôs a hold about a foot above you on the left. 
 JANE: I know. [pauses and then leaps for it] 
 MAGGIE: Nice grab! Keep going! You‚Äôre almost there, babe. 
 JANE: [struggling to find a foothold] I can‚Äôt. My calf‚Äôs cramping. 
 MAGGIE: You need to get off your toes. Get on the ball of your foot. 
 JANE: I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ 
 MAGGIE: [nods] Yes, you can. You can get all the way to the top. 
 [Jane cringes, her leg still obviously cramping. She tries to reach for another rock and slips altogether, only suspended by the belay rope now.] 
 MAGGIE: It‚Äôs ok, I got you. You alright? 
 JANE: Looks like you were wrong. 
 MAGGIE: [laughs lightly] Yeah, but you did awesome. That‚Äôs the highest you‚Äôve gotten, I‚Äôm proud of you. 
 JANE: I don‚Äôt feel so good‚Ä¶ 
 MAGGIE: Ok, come on down. 
 [The rope starts sliding and Jane starts coming down. But we see that Maggie is staring at her hand and the rope, worried expression on her face.] 
 JANE: [looks down] Mom, you ok? 
 [Inside Maggie‚Äôs hand and arm, electrical impulses zap their way up and down the tendons.] 
 MAGGIE: Oh god‚Ä¶ [losing control of her hands] 
 [The rope is unleashed completely and Jane falls from the top of the rock, screaming until she hits the padded ground. Another climbing coach rushes over to see her wincing and clutching at her arm.] 
 JANE: My arm‚Ä¶ I think I broke it. 
 COACH: Don‚Äôt move. 
 MAGGIE: [kneels next to her] Oh Jane, I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶ 
 JANE: What happened? Did the rope break? 
 MAGGIE: [almost panicking] No‚Ä¶ My hands‚Ä¶ [stares at her own hands] I can‚Äôt move them‚Ä¶ 
 [Diagnostic‚Äôs office. There is a snowglobe and a few candy canes on the table, sparkly festive streamers are also hanging on the walls.] 
 TAUB: [making a cup of tea] She‚Äôs been to an ortho, two neuro‚Äôs, and an immunologist. None of the treatments have had any effect. 
 KUTNER: [licking at a candy cane] You think it‚Äôs over? 
 THIRTEEN: [studying the patient‚Äôs chart] It‚Äôs getting worse. Last neurologist found intermit numbness in both arms as well as the hand paralysis. 
 KUTNER: I meant the game. You think he‚Äôs gonna keep all four of us? 
 FOREMAN: Said he would. No sign of upper motor neuron involvement. 
 [We see House entering quietly behind Kutner.] 
 KUTNER: He lies. 
 HOUSE: [slightly amused tone] My ears are burning. 
 [Kutner freezes, eyes widening over his drink before he turns around to stare at House.] 
 FOREMAN: Tell him you‚Äôre done firing people. 
 HOUSE: Well if I lie, that would be little reassurance. [glances up and starts tearing down the streamers with his cane.] Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure? 
 KUTNER: [frowning] Wasn‚Äôt me. 
 HOUSE: He lied. [tosses a Santa plushie into the trashcan] Homie knows better, Hymie doesn‚Äôt care, and Huntington‚Äôs would have done a better job. 
 THIRTEEN: [looks up at House] I don‚Äôt have Huntington‚Äôs. 
 HOUSE: That you know of. 
 FOREMAN: Why would you‚Ä¶ 
 HOUSE: [cuts Foreman off and trashes more streamers] Because I got sued when I called you ‚Äúhoneybuns‚Äù. 
 KUTNER: [frustratedly] Am I fired if I put up- 
 THIRTEEN: [cuts Kutner off] The point of the game was to scare us. Telling us it‚Äôs over isn‚Äôt scary, therefore he has no reason to say that unless it‚Äôs true. [leveling House with a challenging gaze, House smiles at her and nods] 
 KUTNER: [perks up] Good. Then can we do a Secret Santa? [Foreman looks at him likes he‚Äôs an idiot] 
 HOUSE: I liked you fifteen seconds ago when you were afraid for your job. [more tearing down of streamers by the coffee bar] So who‚Äôs sick? 
 TAUB: Fourty-five year old single mom. It‚Äôs an odd presentation of paralysis. Any history of drug use? 
 THIRTEEN: No. 
 HOUSE: She says there‚Äôs no history. 
 THIRTEEN: She‚Äôs not a liar. 
 HOUSE: Ok, this is gonna be a tough case. I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology. 
 THIRTEEN: Everyone lies but there‚Äôs an exception to every rule. 
 HOUSE: Actually there isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs kinda what makes it a rule. 
 THIRTEEN: The patient‚Äôs mother died of breast cancer when she was seven and she never even knew her mom was sick. She promised herself she would never hide anything from her own daughter. 
 HOUSE: [patronizingly] Oh‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd promised. [Thirteen isn‚Äôt amused] 
 TAUB: And we‚Äôre not her daughter. Patient inherited the BRCA1 mutation from her mom, she got a prophylactic double mastectomy ten years ago. 
 HOUSE: She lied about it. 
 THIRTEEN: She told her co-worker, she told her kid. 
 HOUSE: She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that- 
 TAUB: She didn‚Äôt get reconstructive surgery. 
 [House looks at him, suddenly intrigued.] 
 KUTNER: Ok, we can rule out breast cancer. 
 TAUB: Actually, I was going to rule it in. Paralysis could be paraneoplastic. Even the best surgeon can‚Äôt remove every cell of breast tissue. 
 [Foreman seems convinced and looks to House, who‚Äôs drinking from his usual red cup and thinking.] 
 HOUSE: MRI what‚Äôs left of her chest. Set the machine to scan for irony. [sets his cup down, pausing] I‚Äôm going to go redo the patient history. 
 [Kutner looks confused, Thirteen doesn‚Äôt act surprised but she‚Äôs still annoyed.] 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. House and Jane are sitting side by side on some chairs, both sucking on a lollipop.] 
 HOUSE: You mom tell you about all the dr*gs she does? 
 JANE: [shrugs] She smokes pot once in a while, but not in a long time. 
 HOUSE: What about you? 
 JANE: How would that make her sick? 
 HOUSE: [sarcastically] Are you a doctor? 
 JANE: I‚Äôm eleven‚Ä¶ 
 HOUSE: That‚Äôs not an answer. It‚Äôs an evasion. [looks at his lollipop for a second] Are you drinking? You ever sneak a drink? 
 JANE: I don‚Äôt do any of that stuff. It‚Äôs bad for you. 
 HOUSE: I understand why you don‚Äôt want your mom to know, but I‚Äôm her doctor so- 
 JANE: And I would tell my mom. And I would tell you. 
 HOUSE: Why? 
 JANE: Because she would never lie to me. 
 HOUSE: [won‚Äôt give up yet] What‚Äôs her favorite way to have sex? 
 JANE: [frowns] I don‚Äôt get what sex has to do with breast cancer. 
 HOUSE: [rolls his eyes] Are you a doctor? Did you go to med school since the last time I asked? 
 JANE: You just think we gotta be lying- 
 HOUSE: [cuts her off] White lies? 
 JANE: What are those? 
 HOUSE: Those are lies we tell to make other people feel better. 
 JANE: I don‚Äôt lie. 
 HOUSE: Rationalizations? 
 JANE: What are those? 
 HOUSE: Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better. 
 JANE: No, we don‚Äôt- 
 HOUSE: [cuts her off again] Lies of omission? [Jane looks unsure] Saddlebronc or doggie? That‚Äôs sex talk. 
 JANE: [a moment‚Äôs contemplation] She used to like being on top, but now she likes to be on her stomach. That way she doesn‚Äôt have to see them looking at her scars. 
 [House stares at her for a while, seemingly understanding and drops the topic.] 
 [Hospital cafeteria. Wilson is standing next to House as they wait in line, looking at an MRI scan.] 
 HOUSE: It‚Äôs child abuse. 
 WILSON: Honesty? 
 HOUSE: There‚Äôs a reason that everybody lies. It works. It what allows society to function, it‚Äôs what separates man from beast. 
 WILSON: Oh, I thought that was our thumbs. 
 HOUSE: You wanna know every place your mom‚Äôs thumb has been? 
 WILSON: I‚Äôm sorry I missed rehearsal. Am I taking the ‚Äútruth is good‚Äù side? Don‚Äôt you usually take that side? 
 HOUSE: Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good‚Ä¶ No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like children. Hard work, but they‚Äôre worth it. Because the future depends on them. 
 WILSON: You are so full of love‚Ä¶ or something. [gestures for House to pay up] When you care about someone- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts] You lie to them! You pretend that their constant ponderous musing are interesting. You tell them they‚Äôre not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out. 
 WILSON: I stand corrected and may I say, it‚Äôs been a real pleasure chatting with you. [directs House‚Äôs attention back to the scan] Sila‚Äôs clean, surgical margins looks clear. No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing. It‚Äôs not cancer. 
 [Hospital hallway. Thirteen and Kutner are walking behind him.] 
 HOUSE: We need a new theory. 
 THIRTEEN: Did you catch her lying? 
 HOUSE: Not yet. 
 THIRTEEN: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt know‚Äù would have been a shorter answer. 
 HOUSE: Wouldn‚Äôt you not talking have made this a shorter conversation? Kid says mom‚Äôs a slut. 
 KUTNER: [incredulous] She called her mom a slut? 
 HOUSE: No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything will a pole and a pulse. Not that I‚Äôm judging here. Given her medical history, I‚Äôm actually impressed. 
 THIRTEEN: Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners. Which is why we already tested for, and ruled out, syphilis and any other STDs that could have caused her symptoms. 
 [They arrive just outside the door to House‚Äôs office and he turns around to appraise them.] 
 HOUSE: STDs aren‚Äôt the only risk in risky sex. Problem in sleeping with strangers is‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre strange. 
 KUTNER: We‚Äôll follow up with any recent partners. 
 HOUSE: Send Foreman and Taub. They‚Äôre better liars, more likely to get to the truth. 
 [House enters his office. Thirteen and Kutner sigh, then exit to presumably find the others.] 
 [Foreman and Taub are in an unknown man‚Äôs flat, sitting on low linen-covered chairs, shoeless feet resting on wood floors. Foreman stares at the man, someone Maggie has slept with, while Taub sips his coffee.] 
 ROGER: You think I drugged her? [glances at Taub, who is about to set his coffee onto the arm of his chair] Use a coaster. 
 [Taub picks his drink back up, obviously thinking that the guy has an issue with interior cleanliness that borders on neuroticism.] 
 FOREMAN: We‚Äôre not cops. Legally, we don‚Äôt care one way or another. 
 TAUB: But we need to know the truth so we can help her. 
 ROGER: I‚Äôd known her for less than an hour and she offered to take me home. There was no need to drug her. 
 [Foreman and Taub look at each other.] 
 ROGER: [chuckles nervously] Not that I would. 
 [Foreman and Taub stand up, presumably to leave.] 
 ROGER: But she‚Äôs gonna be ok, right? 
 TAUB: As long as she doesn‚Äôt have to pick up or hold anything. [nodding] 
 ROGER: [sighs then points to their shoeless feet] Uh, sorry. I just had the floors done. Reclaimed pine. 
 [They watch as Roger takes a long gulp out of a giant water bottle. Foreman looks at Taub knowingly.] 
 TAUB: You always this thirsty? 
 ROGER: I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Water‚Äôs supposed to be good for you, right? 
 TAUB: [looks at Foreman] Dehydration, anxiety, aggression‚Ä¶ 
 ROGER: I‚Äôm not aggressive. 
 FOREMAN: Spastic chorea in his right hand. 
 ROGER: [glances at his hand and shakes it uncertainly] What about my hand? 
 FOREMAN: How much do you weight? About 180, 190? 
 ROGER: [starting to panic now] 180. What is- 
 FOREMAN: [interrupts] You took what she did, it could take longer to hit you. Might affect you differently. 
 TAUB: But you didn‚Äôt give her anything. Right? 
 ROGER: [hesitates for a moment, smiling nervously] She was really drunk‚Ä¶ I just gave her some E, to help enhance things. 
 [Taub and Foreman look at each other, smiling lightly in victory.] 
 FOREMAN: Have any of it left? 
 ROGER: [goes to retrieve the pills from a drawer] Is my hand gonna be ok? 
 TAUB: There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. [smug] We lied. 
 [Clinc room. House is diagnosing an attractive blonde woman in a low cut shirt.] 
 MELANIE: I‚Äôve had a sore throat for a few days now. My stomach‚Äôs also been bothering me. I think my glands are swollen. 
 HOUSE: [feels her glands under her throat but then is distracted by the necklace she‚Äôs wearing] Saint Nicholas? 
 MELANIE: [smiles] Patron saint of children. 
 HOUSE: Also seamen, merchants, archers, prostitutes, and prisoners. 
 MELANIE: Hmm‚Ä¶ Must have been pretty hardworking. 
 HOUSE: [shrugs] Or just a credit hog. 
 [Melanie laughs lightly] 
 HOUSE: Open wide. [shines a flashlight into her mouth] Say ‚Äúaah‚Äù. 
 [Melanie says ‚Äúaah‚Äù and House clicks the flashlight off, turning to his paperwork.] You have strep. 
 MELANIE: Is it contagious? 
 HOUSE: Only for the next 24 hours as long as you take the antibiotics. 
 MELANIE: [worriedly] How contagious? 
 HOUSE: Take a personal day. 
 MELANIE: I can‚Äôt! 
 HOUSE: [looks at her with a mock serious expression] I‚Äôll write your pimp a note. 
 MELANIE: My pimp? 
 HOUSE: You‚Äôre tested for AIDS every three months and‚Ä¶ your necklace. 
 MELANIE: [amused] Prostitutes wear religious symbols? 
 HOUSE: I think they just like kneeling. [smiles] You don‚Äôt have the skin of a seaman, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant, or the attitude of an ex-con. So, just leaves one left. 
 MELANIE: Mmm‚Ä¶ Two actually. [gives him a flirtatious smile] But I‚Äôm not a child, am I? 
 [House gives her a conceding smile and hands her the prescription, then grabs his cane and exits. Cuddy meets up with him at the nurse‚Äôs station.] 
 CUDDY: You owe me 50 bucks. 
 HOUSE: Then you owe me half a lapdance. 
 CUDDY: It‚Äôs for the nurses‚Äô holiday bonus. I know you got the memo. 
 HOUSE: Got the memo last year. I want to hire forty more fellows. 
 CUDDY: You already fired the ones you hired? 
 HOUSE: They work better when they‚Äôre scared. 
 [Cuddy looks half confused until Taub walks in.] 
 TAUB: You were right. Guy slipped her Ecstasy. 
 [Cuddy looks up, obviously surprised.] 
 HOUSE: He have any symptoms? 
 TAUB: No. Kutner‚Äôs starting the patient on hemodialysis and Thirteen‚Äôs in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the dr*gs. [leaves the clinic] 
 [Cuddy blinks, still confused. House gestures to Taub to make his point.] 
 HOUSE: See? Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation, with absolutely no attitude or fear. [reaches to grab another patient‚Äôs file] 
 CUDDY: Something‚Äôs gotta be done. 
 HOUSE: Oh yeah. 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. Kutner has just finished setting her up on hemodialysis and checking her over.] 
 KUTNER: How are you feeling? 
 MAGGIE: I still can‚Äôt move my hands. 
 KUTNER: It will take a few more hours to cycle all your blood through the machine. 
 [Maggie looks up from her hands, blinking and looking confused.] 
 MAGGIE: What just happened? 
 KUTNER: [turns and looks around] Nothing. What‚Äôs wrong? 
 MAGGIE: What do you mean? The lights just went out. Didn‚Äôt they? 
 [Kutner sets down the file, unsure. Jane moves to her mom‚Äôs bedside.] 
 JANE: What did you do? 
 MAGGIE: Is this from the dr*gs? 
 KUTNER: [shines a flashlight over her eyes, no response] Most of the dr*gs should be out of your system by now and our dr*gs- 
 MAGGIE: I can‚Äôt see‚Ä¶ 
 JANE: [scared] Do something! 
 MAGGIE: I can‚Äôt see! I can‚Äôt see! 
 [Diagnostic‚Äôs office. House is writing things down on little slips of yellow paper when the duckies enter.] 
 THIRTEEN: Nothing in the Ecstasy except Ecstasy. 
 HOUSE: Well that never hurt anybody. 
 FOREMAN: Can‚Äôt make them blind days later. 
 HOUSE: [looks at one of the slips of paper in his hands, frowning] Do you spell ‚Äúhomie‚Äù with a Y? 
 [Kutner glances up, intrigued, but House folds the paper up without letting them see what‚Äôs written.] 
 HOUSE: I want to be respectful. 
 KUTNER: You‚Äôre actually going to let us do Secret Santa? 
 HOUSE: Not just you guys. [turns around to grab a Christmas socking and puts the slips of paper inside, shaking it up to mix them] I like presents too. [offers the stocking up to Taub] Pick a name. 
 TAUB: [looks suspicious] Why are you doing this? 
 HOUSE: See, this is why no one likes your people. 
 [Taub almost looks offended.] 
 HOUSE: The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, because it‚Äôs actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year. 
 FOREMAN: So you think this is the part of the year they screwed up? 
 HOUSE: On the other hand, you are now a team. Gotta work together and the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people so spend 25 bucks. Learn to love‚Ä¶ 
 [Taub seems unimpressed but indulges him anyways and goes to pick a name out of the stocking.] 
 THIRTEEN: Blindness could be a complication from the hemodialysis. 
 [House offers the stocking to Kutner next.] 
 KUTNER: No, the dialysate composition was within range. [looks at the name on his slip of paper, giving a nod and smiling to himself] Sweet. 
 HOUSE: Interesting. 
 THIRTEEN: The dialysate composition just indicates- 
 HOUSE: [cuts her off] Indicates nothing. I was referring to his reaction to the name he got. 
 KUTNER: I was pleased. I thought it‚Äôd be fun to buy for- 
 HOUSE: Means‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs someone here who wouldn‚Äôt be fun to buy for. [purposeful pause as he stares at Kutner] I wonder who. [offers up the stocking to Thirteen next] Pick a name, then go check out the patient‚Äôs house. 
 [Thirteen looks at her name and doesn‚Äôt seem to pleased with it. She shoves it into the pocket of her labcoat instead.] 
 HOUSE: [smiles slowly] Interesting‚Ä¶ 
 [Thirteen looks at him and they lock eyes for a moment as House seems to be calculating something in his mind.] 
 FOREMAN: We‚Äôre wasting time going to the home. Kearns-Sayer syndrome fits the symptoms. [takes a name from the stocking and tucks it into his jacket‚Äôs inner pocket without even looking.] 
 HOUSE: No family history of Kearns. Go to their house- 
 THIRTEEN: [interrupts] They would have told us if there were any other dr*gs. You met her, she couldn‚Äôt have been more candid. 
 HOUSE: You‚Äôre absolutely right. Go to their house- 
 TAUB: [cuts him off again] MS or a vascular problem fits better. They could affect hands and eyes. 
 HOUSE: Fine. Do an MRI, check for MS. And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere. 
 [The group gets up, ready to leave.] 
 HOUSE: Oh! And whoever goes to their house‚Ä¶ get me their computers. 
 [The duckies are obviously frustrated that he won‚Äôt drop the subject.] 
 HOUSE: You talk to your kid about sex so she‚Äôll think you‚Äôre being open about everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don‚Äôt want to talk about. [goes to grab the last name from the stocking for himself] 
 THIRTEEN: That‚Äôs right. Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is. 
 HOUSE: [looks at the slip of paper] Yes! Exactly who I wanted. This is going to be fun. 
 [The duckies leave and House simply smiles, turning to throw the stocking to the side.] 
 [Lab room. Taub and Foreman are about to perform the fluorescein angiogram on Maggie.] 
 TAUB: The dye may sting when it enters your bloodstream, 
 JANE: Are you scared, mom? 
 MAGGIE: [turns in the direction of her daughter‚Äôs voice] Yeah. Are you? 
 JANE: [nods] Yeah. 
 MAGGIE: Are they? 
 JANE: [looks at Foreman and Taub] They don‚Äôt look scared. 
 MAGGIE: Either they‚Äôre confident or they just don‚Äôt care. [laughs hesitantly] 
 FOREMAN: We‚Äôre confident. 
 TAUB: Okay if I shift you a bit? Get you into position. 
 [Taub settles her head on the chinrest of the machine and then moves to sit on the other side, pressing a few buttons to get it up and running.] 
 JANE: Your boss is weird. 
 TAUB: Yeah, he is. He thought he‚Äôd get information you may not have been telling us by‚Ä¶ 
 MAGGIE: Being a jerk? 
 TAUB: You‚Äôd be surprised how often it works. 
 FOREMAN: Choroidal flush looks good. 
 JANE: Why would people lie to a doctor? 
 FOREMAN: Dozens of reasons to lie, only one reason to tell the truth. 
 TAUB: You‚Äôre never even tempted? [glancing to Maggie] I mean, lies do sometimes smooth things out, make life easier. 
 MAGGIE: Yeah? Your life easy? 
 FOREMAN: Not even close. Dye‚Äôs reached the retinal capillary bed. No leakage. 
 [There‚Äôs a moment of silence as Taub and Foreman glance at each other, unsure.] 
 JANE: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ good, right? 
 TAUB: Means it‚Äôs not a vascular problem. 
 MAGGIE: But? 
 FOREMAN: Vascular problem, we could fix. 
 [Jane watches as Foreman and Taub look at each other again, both afraid to say anything else.] 
 JANE: They look worried now, mom. 
 [Employee‚Äôs lounge. House is playing foosball by himself when Wilson enters.] 
 WILSON: What‚Äôs with the Secret Santa? You trying to bring them together? 
 HOUSE: I want to drive them apart. 
 WILSON: With gift giving? 
 HOUSE: Conflict‚Äôs built right into the name. Santa‚Äôs about sharing, secret‚Äôs about withholding. [scores a goal and continues on playing by himself] 
 WILSON: Aside from the Trojan horse, gifts don‚Äôt usually- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts] What did you get your wife for your final anniversary? 
 WILSON: [thinks about it for a second] Uh‚Ä¶ a sweater. 
 HOUSE: She hated it. 
 WILSON: She loved it. 
 HOUSE: Then you didn‚Äôt buy it. [scores another goal, for the other team] 
 WILSON: I‚Ä¶ gave her some cash and‚Ä¶ 
 HOUSE: [stops and turns to look at Wilson, obviously not impressed] Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person and nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeon hole. 
 [House scores another goal on himself and Wilson is pretty much speechless.] 
 [Hospital main entrance. Kutner and Thirteen are returning from presumably searching Maggie‚Äôs home, as Thirteen is holding two laptops under her arm.] 
 KUTNER: I‚Äôm thinking of spending a few extra bucks on my Secret Santa. 
 THIRTEEN: Bad idea. You mind if I tell House you asked them for the key instead of breaking in? 
 [They walk further into the hospital, amusingly carrying two conversation at the same time.] 
 KUTNER: Yes, I do. Just another five bucks. 
 THIRTEEN: Five will be ten. The key‚Äôs proof she doesn‚Äôt have anything to hide. 
 KUTNER: The key is proof I didn‚Äôt do exactly what House told me to do. And what do you care if it‚Äôs another fifteen? 
 THIRTEEN: I‚Äôm gonna tell him. And who are you so anxious to please? 
 KUTNER: [scoffs and presses the elevator button as they arrive] Not you. You really think you‚Äôre going to prove people are capable of honesty using a mother and daughter you‚Äôve known for one day? 
 THIRTEEN: I‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs based his entire world view on the proposition. If I‚Äôm wrong, so what? If he‚Äôs wrong‚Ä¶ 
 [Elevator arrives and they step in, Kutner taking the hood of his hoodie to look at her.] 
 KUTNER: So you really have Huntington‚Äôs? 
 THIRTEEN: Nope. 
 KUTNER: But House said that- 
 THIRTEEN: [cuts him off defensively] If I wanted to talk about it, why didn‚Äôt I bring it up? 
 [Elevator door closes.] 
 [House‚Äôs office. House is trying passwords to hack into Maggie‚Äôs computer as the duckies look on. He‚Äôs slowly getting more impatient.] 
 TAUB: Fluorescein angiogram was clear. No leaks, no lesions, definitely not a vascular problem. 
 HOUSE: [frowns at the computer, still having no luck] Someone get their birthdays out of the file. 
 THIRTEEN: Have you tried leaving it blank? 
 [She steps up and enters in a blank password for him, logging them in immediately to show a desktop wallpaper of Maggie and Jane, lovingly smiling together and posing for the camera. House looks majorly disappointed.] 
 THIRTEEN: Tough to get into the head of someone who actually trusts people, huh? Found both computers in an office, on a desk they share. 
 TAUB: No sign of macular degeneration or optic neuritis. Her eyes are completely normal. 
 FOREMAN: Except she can‚Äôt see out of them. 
 HOUSE: [rifling through files on the computer] So she says. Find anything on the MRI? 
 FOREMAN: No sign of plaques. It‚Äôs not MS. 
 TAUB: We haven‚Äôt found anything abnormal on any test. 
 KUTNER: Except she can‚Äôt see or move her hands. 
 HOUSE: [with more emphasis this time] So she says. 
 THIRTEEN: You can‚Äôt lie about flaccid paralysis. 
 FOREMAN: Maybe she‚Äôs not lying. 
 [House looks up, intrigued.] 
 FOREMAN: Her brain is. What if it‚Äôs a conversion disorder? 
 HOUSE: [musingly] Lacks personal boundaries‚Ä¶ Promiscuous‚Ä¶ Inappropriate obsession with truth-telling‚Ä¶ Certainly sounds like a psych case. 
 KUTNER: Cool. I‚Äôll set up a psych consult and start her on anti-depressants. [starts to leave] 
 HOUSE: Nope. 
 [Kutner turns back around, confused.] 
 HOUSE: Her mind is tricking her body. We need to trick her mind. Or even better. 
 [House grabs his cane and exits, Thirteen seems to understand something, looks slightly worried, and proceeds to follow him out.] 
 [Hospital hallway. Thirteen follows House as he heads for Maggie‚Äôs room.] 
 THIRTEEN: You don‚Äôt need her. 
 HOUSE: I know. 
 THIRTEEN: Then this serves no medical purpose. 
 HOUSE: You have a genetic defect, you choose to ignore it. This woman has a genetic defect, chooses to butcher herself to be safe. Yet what you claim to be fascinated by, is her honesty. Interesting. 
 THIRTEEN: You claim to want the truth, and then you screw with people who actually live by it. Pathetic. 
 [They stop outside Maggie‚Äôs room and House turns to face her.] 
 HOUSE: Hey, I gave you credit for interesting. 
 [Thirteen sighs, knowing she‚Äôs lost the argument.] 
 HOUSE: You‚Äôre protecting her because you‚Äôre jealous she did what you couldn‚Äôt. 
 [Thirteen decides she can‚Äôt take this anymore and starts to walk off. House rolls his eyes.] 
 HOUSE: I need you. 
 THIRTEEN: [turns back around and shakes her head] I‚Äôm not lying to her. 
 HOUSE: Fine, keep your mouth shut. I still need you. If it doesn‚Äôt work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom. 
 [Thirteen gives him a skeptical look but he merely nods.] 
 HOUSE: That does actually serve a medical purpose. 
 [Thirteen seems to consent and House slides the door to the room open to catch the daughter‚Äôs attention.] 
 HOUSE: Jane. 
 [Hospital hallway, couches across from nurse‚Äôs station. Thirteen is pretending to read a file while House talks to Jane.] 
 JANE: I have to lie because she trusts me? 
 HOUSE: If you show doubt, the placebo treatment won‚Äôt work. 
 JANE: If it‚Äôs just depression, that‚Äôs good news right? 
 HOUSE: [nods] A lot of great medications. 
 JANE: So why can‚Äôt we just give her those? Why do we have to lie to her? 
 HOUSE: Because we might be wrong. And those medications take a long time to work and since your mom‚Äôs condition is declining, there‚Äôs a chance the dr*gs won‚Äôt tell us anything until it‚Äôs too late. 
 JANE: [still doesn‚Äôt seem convinced] My mom‚Äôs not depressed. 
 HOUSE: Maybe she‚Äôs hiding it from you. 
 JANE: [shakes her head] No. She wouldn‚Äôt- 
 HOUSE: Just doing what every good mom does. Protecting her child from bad news that she can‚Äôt do anything about. 
 JANE: My mom‚Äôs never lied to me. 
 HOUSE: You don‚Äôt know how to lie. You don‚Äôt know how to tell when you‚Äôre being lied to. 
 JANE: [stares at him for a moment and then drops her eyes, seemingly less unconvinced now] Maybe you‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ 
 HOUSE: I know‚Ä¶ 
 JANE: I was lying. [satisfied with her little show] I know how to lie. I just won‚Äôt do it to my mother. 
 [House licks his lips and glances subtly up at Thirteen. She shuts the file she‚Äôs been pretending to read and moves over to look at Jane.] 
 THIRTEEN: You like foosball? 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. Taub is preparing her for the placebo treatment.] 
 TAUB: Until the treatment of your infectious parapheresis takes effect, Jane can‚Äôt come back into the room. I‚Äôve already been inoculated. 
 MAGGIE: Can she have it already? 
 TAUB: Don‚Äôt worry. [hangs up the IV bag] It‚Äôs a very effective treatment, you should be feeling better in a matter of minutes. 
 [Maggie swallows hard, making a noise of discomfort as he sticks the IV needle in.] 
 TAUB: Don‚Äôt you think Jane deserves a few secrets? Some personal space? Room to uh‚Ä¶ make her own mistakes? [taking her wrist to take her pulse for a moment] 
 MAGGIE: She makes plenty of mistakes. Only difference is, I‚Äôm there to help her through them. 
 TAUB: [shakes his head and drops her hand] But she‚Äôs gotta know you‚Äôre looking over her shoulder. It‚Äôs gotta stifle- 
 MAGGIE: You think the world would be a better place if everybody always acted like their mom was looking over their shoulder? 
 [Maggie lies back down and closes her eyes, obviously still in pain. Taub takes a seat nearby, glancing at his watch and then moving to pick up a magazine to read.] 
 [Employee‚Äôs lounge. Kutner, Foreman, and Thirteen are keeping Jane busy by playing foosball with her.] 
 JANE: I wanna go see my mom. 
 KUTNER: She‚Äôs sleeping. Why don‚Äôt we just double the amount we can spend? 
 FOREMAN: Nope. 
 KUTNER: Can‚Äôt afford another twenty-five? 
 FOREMAN: We allow people fifty, people will spend sixty. 
 KUTNER: Ah, so you can‚Äôt afford another thirty-five. 
 THIRTEEN: You must really like who you got... 
 JANE: Or really dislike. 
 [Thirteen and Foreman stop playing and look up at her, intrigued.] 
 JANE: My mom always gives the best presents to the teachers I get along with the worst. 
 THIRTEEN/FOREMAN: [both look skeptical] No. 
 [Kutner looks confused too and Jane takes advantage of the opportunity to score a goal on them.] 
 KUTNER: [at Foreman and Thirteen] How do you know ‚Äúno‚Äù? 
 THIRTEEN: I know you didn‚Äôt get House. 
 FOREMAN: I know he didn‚Äôt get House. 
 [They look at each other, unsure for the moment.] 
 [Hospital hallway. House and Wilson are sitting down and eating pizza together.] 
 WILSON: You gave them all your name? 
 HOUSE: Mm-hmm. Figured I could sow some dissension and get a few ties and sweaters. 
 WILSON: What happens when they find out? 
 HOUSE: It‚Äôs Secret Santa. 
 WILSON: [nods] What happens when they find out? 
 HOUSE: [shrugs] They‚Äôll argue about with that information. Ties are less important than the dissension. 
 [Back in the employee‚Äôs lounge and the duckies are doing exactly what House predicted.] 
 KUTNER: Well we still have to buy him something. 
 FOREMAN: [arms crossed, obviously displeased] Not a chance! 
 KUTNER: We weren‚Äôt supposed to discuss this. We‚Äôre not supposed to know. 
 FOREMAN: He‚Äôs not supposed to put his name in there five times! 
 JANE: He wants presents. It‚Äôs sad‚Ä¶ 
 THIRTEEN: It‚Äôs pathetic. 
 [Jane looks lost, but Kutner shrugs.] 
 KUTNER: [smiling lightly] I‚Äôm still buying him a present. 
 THIRTEEN: [firmly] No. You‚Äôre not. 
 KUTNER: [glares at her] Fine. 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. She seems half conscious but it making sounds in her throat as if trying to speak. Taub, who has been napping, glances up.] 
 TAUB: What‚Äôs wrong? 
 MAGGIE: I think it‚Äôs getting worse. Can‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶ [struggles to catch her breath just as the monitors start beeping] 
 TAUB: [calls outside] I need a nurse in here! 
 [Taub shines a flashlight into her throat to look and we see her throat being slowly constricted with inflamed nodes or something like that.] 
 TAUB: Her lymph nodes are cutting off her airway. We gotta intubate! 
 [The nurses rush in with a cart and Taub proceeds to intubate Maggie.] 
 [We see Foreman and Cameron adjusting Maggie‚Äôs breathing apparatus as Jane looks on worriedly, outside the room. The scene then jumps over the House‚Äôs office where he is still reading files on the computers as the duckies look on.] 
 FOREMAN: Swollen lymph nodes were cutting off Maggie‚Äôs airway. We shrunk them with alcohol, she‚Äôs breathing on her own now. 
 HOUSE: [head in his hand, looking disappointed] Well, that sucks. 
 [Taub raises his eyebrows at that answer.] 
 HOUSE: 4300 saved emails and not a single mention of ‚Äúlesbionic‚Äù, ‚Äúsanchez‚Äù or ‚Äúman-gina‚Äù. 
 [Kutner perks up as he sees a small wrapped gift on House desk. Foreman isn‚Äôt amused by House‚Äôs answer.] 
 HOUSE: Swollen lymph nodes means it wasn‚Äôt psychological. 
 KUTNER: Who‚Äôs that from? 
 HOUSE: [glances to the present] Santa, obviously. ‚ÄòCause you know I worship him. [pauses and frowns] No wait, I mean Satan. I always get them confused. [continues to read through emails] What is‚Ä¶ an alpine butterfly? And why is she learning how to do one? 
 [Taub moves over to peer over House‚Äôs shoulder.] 
 FOREMAN: House, we already have a full history. You don‚Äôt need to waste time- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts] It‚Äôs just a climbing knot. 
 TAUB: But what does she use it for? Try ‚Äúbondage‚Äù. 
 [Thirteen glares at Taub indulging House‚Äôs antics.] 
 HOUSE: I did once. [sarcastically] And she just tied me down and whined about how hard it is to be Dean of Medicine. 
 [Thirteen is losing patience and Foreman drops his head, attempting to hide his amusement at that.] 
 KUTNER: Gyms aren‚Äôt exactly pristine, could be a fungal infection. Seriously, who‚Äôs it from? [nodding to the present again] 
 FOREMAN: No fever, no elevated white count. 
 HOUSE: [still staring at the screen, then laughs in a mocking way] That‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ Friend sent her a Garfield cartoon. That cat sure does love lasagna. 
 THIRTEEN: House. [finally had enough and slams the laptop lip on top of his hand] Stop obsessing. 
 HOUSE: [pausing for a moment] If it weren‚Äôt for my obsessions, you wouldn‚Äôt know that she has sarcoidosis. 
 [The duckies all stare at him as he turns the laptop around to show them.] 
 HOUSE: Eighteen months ago, she sold her Stairmaster. It was only two months old. Now either she needed the cash or climbing stairs was getting more difficult. [takes a sip out of his cup and continues to scroll through the emails to show them] Twelve months ago, she cancelled a hiking trip. Now she either just wanted to sit home and watch TV or walking was getting more difficult. She‚Äôs been suffering joint pain for the last two years. 
 [House takes the present box and offers it up to Thirteen. She gives him a cautious look.] 
 HOUSE: Pull my ribbon. [mockingly seductive] If you know what I mean. 
 THIRTEEN: ACE levels are too low for sarcoidosis. [stares at him for a moment and then pulls the ribbon] 
 HOUSE: That‚Äôs not what I meant. [proceeds to open the present] Could just be an inactive phase. 
 KUTNER: It‚Äôs not Christmas yet. 
 HOUSE: I remembered. I‚Äôm not a Satanist, I‚Äôm a druid. 
 FOREMAN: No lung involvement. 
 HOUSE: Yet. 
 TAUB: We‚Äôll need a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm it. 
 HOUSE: [makes a sad face] That‚Äôs a shame. I‚Äôm not gonna surprise her with one for Christmas. 
 [The duckies get up to leave and House finally unwraps his present to reveal an iPhone.] 
 HOUSE: Wow! 
 [The duckies stop and turn back to look at him.] 
 HOUSE: [grins] Now either that cost more than 25 bucks or I‚Äôm seriously starting to doubt Steve Jobs‚Äô business strategies. 
 [Thirteen rolls her eyes and Kutner looks speechless. They all leave.] 
 HOUSE: Thanks! 
 [Maggie is undergoing the bronchoalveolar lavage in a lab. Kutner is holding the tube down her throat while Thirteen assists.] 
 THIRTEEN: Last round of saline, Maggie. One more big breath. We‚Äôve gotta get the liquid to go all the way into your lungs, okay? [attaches a syringe to the scope and pushes the saline solution into the tube] Here we go. 
 KUTNER: Gift could be from a patient. 
 TAUB: [skeptical] Who sent it to the wrong doctor? 
 THIRTEEN: House obviously gave the present to himself. 
 [Hospital cafeteria. Wilson is eating and reading over a file until House walks over and hands the iPhone back to him, taking a seat himself. Wilson tries to control his anger.] 
 HOUSE: [pleased] They‚Äôre arguing right now. 
 WILSON: I‚Äôve been looking for this all morning. 
 HOUSE: Did you look in the box on my desk? Oh by the way, your mom called. Your dad‚Äôs dead. 
 WILSON: [puts the iPhone back into his pocket and raises an eyebrow] You left the present sitting on your desk? 
 HOUSE: Wouldn‚Äôt have been as effective sitting in my closet in my home. 
 WILSON: They‚Äôre gonna know it‚Äôs from you. 
 HOUSE: No, they‚Äôre gonna guess that it was from me. Might even be 90% sure that it was from me but all that means is, they‚Äôre 10% sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over. 
 WILSON: [blinks at that overwhelming explanation and gets up to dump his plate] Have you ever considered channeling your powers to, I don‚Äôt know... bring peace to the mid-east? 
 HOUSE: [gets up to follow him] I couldn‚Äôt do that. 
 WILSON: But if they ever got it, you could screw it up. 
 HOUSE: Yeah. That‚Äôs more where my powers lie. 
 [Back in the lab where the duckies are performing the bronchoalveolar lavage.] 
 TAUB: Gift could be from Wilson. 
 THIRTEEN: [firmly] It‚Äôs House. 
 KUTNER: Why do you have a problem with him speculating? 
 THIRTEEN: Because. That‚Äôs what House wants us to do. 
 TAUB: [moves away from the monitor] Lungs are pristine, no infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage. 
 KUTNER: Maggie, I‚Äôm gonna remove the scope. I need you to cough for me, okay? 
 [Maggie nods and coughs as Kutner starts pulling the tube back out of her throat.] 
 KUTNER: Littler harder. 
 [She does as told, nearly choking as Kutner removes the whole tube.] 
 KUTNER: Great. 
 [But Maggie keeps coughing and we see that there‚Äôs blood trickling out of her right eye now.] 
 TAUB: [cautiously] Maggie‚Ä¶ Open your eyes. 
 [Kutner and Thirteen turn back to look at her, both aware that something is wrong. Maggie opens her eyes and we see that the sclera has been stained with blood.] 
 MAGGIE: Why aren‚Äôt you saying anything? 
 [A pause as the duckies look at each other, more worried now.] 
 MAGGIE: What‚Äôs wrong? 
 [The clinic. Thirteen, Taub, and Kutner walk in to find House, who‚Äôs looking over charts at the nurse‚Äôs station.] 
 TAUB: Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis. 
 KUTNER: But she‚Äôs bleeding into her eyes now. 
 HOUSE: [looks genuinely concerned] Have her platelets dropped? 
 KUTNER: Plummeted. New labs show they‚Äôre under 40. She‚Äôll bleed out of every orifice if we don‚Äôt find the cause. 
 TAUB: Could be spleen sequestration, tuberculosis- 
 THIRTEEN: [interrupts] Brochet disease, TTP- 
 KUTNER: [continues to contribute] Hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis, lupus- 
 HOUSE: [frowns at them mockingly] Listing all the possible causes is only impressive if you can do it reverse alphabetically. We need to know why her platelet machine is broken. Go to the factory. Do a bone marrow aspiration. 
 [Thirteen and Taub exit but Kutner visibly lingers, first seeming unsure until he approaches House and House looks back at him cautiously.] 
 KUTNER: I‚Äôm your Secret Santa. 
 [Thirteen and Taub are out of hearing range but glance back to see why Kutner isn‚Äôt coming.] 
 HOUSE: [lowers his voice] Well you‚Äôre not supposed to tell. 
 KUTNER: But you got a present already. Which means you have more than one Secret Santa. 
 HOUSE: Or‚Ä¶ somebody else wants to make me happy. 
 KUTNER: [looks unconvinced and a little hurt but reaches into his pocket and hands House a present with a smile] Merry Christmas. 
 [Thirteen and Taub look at each other. House accepts the present with a hint of a smile and Kutner turns to leave, mouth dropping as he sees the other two and Thirteen gives him a death glare. House grins devilishly and exits.] 
 [Clinic examination room. The blonde woman, Melanie is back and she gives House a small wave as he enters, looking somewhat confused.] 
 HOUSE: On one hand, you should be in bed. [shuts the door] On the other hand, I told you to rest so‚Ä¶ I see your dilemma. 
 MELANIE: I don‚Äôt think resting is the problem. Can strep cause this? [pulls away her scarf to reveal red bulbous little growths all along her neck. They‚Äôre on the backs of her hands too.] 
 HOUSE: [in a singsong-y voice] Clap on. 
 MELANIE: Trust me, first place I went. No rash on my labia. Do you need to take a look? 
 HOUSE: [wants to say yes but then shuts his mouth] I‚Äôm saving my money for a Red Ryder BB-g*n. 
 [She gives him an amused look. He sits down in front of her and uses his cane to pull the equipment table closer.] 
 HOUSE: Darker shade of lipstick? 
 MELANIE: I‚Äôm not very any. 
 HOUSE: [leans closer to inspect her lips presumably] You tell your mother what you do? 
 [She gives him one of those looks that says ‚Äúis this really relevant?‚Äù.] 
 HOUSE: Doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm curious. 
 MELANIE: I don‚Äôt need to break her heart just do I can feel righteous. 
 HOUSE: [touches a finger to her lips and feels them] You do a donkey show? [a purposeful pause] I‚Äôm not curious. It matters. 
 MELANIE: It‚Äôs a donkey or a mule‚Ä¶ [gives him a knowing look] I can never remember. 
 HOUSE: Wow‚Ä¶ That is a creepy smile. [cringes lightly] I bet the donkey‚Äôs is even creepier. 
 MELANIE: [laughs lightly] Do I have to explain? 
 HOUSE: Nope. It‚Äôs my job. Contagious ecthyma. Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat. Has there been‚Ä¶ contact? [cringing again] 
 [She gives him a cute little nod.] 
 HOUSE: [starts writing her prescription] Okay. Antibiotic cream for you and a love glove for Francis. You‚Äôll both be fine. 
 MELANIE: [turns to grab an ad from her purse, which she hands to him] You should come see the show. I think you‚Äôd like it. [another insinuating smile] 
 HOUSE: Sorry, I hate Westerns. 
 [She smiles and leaves the ad with him anyways then exists with a smile. House reads the ad and smiles, understanding coming to him.] 
 [Operation room. Chase is performing the bone marrow aspiration on a ventilated Maggie as Foreman watches.] 
 CHASE: So they really never lie? 
 FOREMAN: Doesn‚Äôt seem like it. Admirable. You tell Cameron everything? 
 CHASE: Hah! No. 
 [Chase pries open the skin with forceps and Foreman nods.] 
 FOREMAN: You think she keeps secrets? 
 CHASE: If I knew, they would be secrets. I hope she does. People have a right to a little privacy, even from the people they love. 
 [Foreman hands him the drill and he starts drilling into Maggie‚Äôs bone.] 
 FOREMAN: You buy House a present? 
 CHASE: Why would I? 
 FOREMAN: To screw with me. 
 CHASE: Then I‚Äôm gonna say yes. 
 [Foreman stares at the monitor and shakes his head. We see that there‚Äôs smoke coming up from the hole in which Chase is drilling into.] 
 FOREMAN: No no, wait. Stop, stop. What‚Äôs that smell? 
 [Chase stops drilling. He and Foreman both look into the hole.] 
 FOREMAN: Her bone is smoking. 
 CHASE: Her bones are harder than the drill? 
 [Xray room. House and the duckies are looking over xray‚Äôs of the bones in Maggie‚Äôs body.] 
 KUTNER: We ran a full body bone scan to find the cause of hardening in the hip. No hotspots anywhere. 
 THIRTEEN: Tracer could have been inactive. 
 KUTNER: So I screwed up the test? 
 [Thirteen shrugs.] 
 TAUB: There‚Äôs so many ways that could have happened. Maybe it was inactive, maybe it didn‚Äôt fully circulate. 
 KUTNER: It circulated, the camera picked up- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts them] Hey, hey. It‚Äôs Christmas! Why are you guys fighting? 
 FOREMAN: Why do you think there are no hotspots? 
 KUTNER: I did not screw up! The density‚Äôs consistent. 
 FOREMAN: Just means the density was consistent, doesn‚Äôt mean it was cold. It‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶ all she has are hotspots. It‚Äôs consistent because her entire skeleton is turning to stone. 
 [The duckies, stunned, look to House for his opinions.] 
 HOUSE: Good for an aspiring superhero. Fatal for a human hoping to make it to Kwanzaa. 
 KUTNER: Well it‚Äôs gotta be from a carbonic anhydrase type 2 deficiency. 
 HOUSE: It has free will. It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything doesn‚Äôt want to be. 
 KUTNER: I meant, if it‚Äôs not CAII‚Ä¶ well, none of the other causes of osteopetrosis are treatable. 
 [House and all the duckeis ponder that depressing thought for a moment.] 
 HOUSE: [to Kutner] You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs gotta be. Go run her blood and hope that your sunny optimism isn‚Äôt misplaced. 
 [The duckies exit.] 
 [Nurse‚Äôs station in a hallway. House walks up to Wilson, who is reviewing a few files.] 
 HOUSE: They accused Kutner of screwing up a test. Because they hate him. 
 WILSON: You‚Äôre surprised? That‚Äôs the sort of crap that happens when you mess with people‚Äôs heads. 
 [Wilson turns to leave and House follows.] 
 HOUSE: Well one day he will screw up a test. If they don‚Äôt accuse him of that because they like him, someone could die. [a pause] Where are we going? 
 WILSON: Nowhere, I just know it hurts you. 
 [Wilson walks away and House stops, glaring at him but seemingly amused.] 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. Taub is talking with Maggie and Jane is in the room as well.] 
 TAUB: CAII deficiency is a genetic disorder that scrambles proteins. [draws some blood from her] If the blood test is positive, you‚Äôll need a bone marrow transplant. 
 MAGGIE: ‚ÄúTransplant‚Äù sounds like a euphemism for ‚Äúslim odds‚Äù. 
 TAUB: Uh‚Ä¶ Slim, but not none. 
 [Maggie sighs.] 
 TAUB: We‚Äôre gonna need to test Jane for a match. 
 MAGGIE: Don‚Äôt you have donor banks? 
 TAUB: Jane is your best bet. Procedure‚Äôs perfectly safe, there‚Äôs no risk. 
 MAGGIE: No risk. [scoffs] 
 TAUB: Any surgery has- 
 MAGGIE: [cuts him off] Then don‚Äôt tell me there‚Äôs no risk. You going to tell me there‚Äôs no pain either? 
 TAUB: The testing will hurt a little‚Ä¶ 
 JANE: I‚Äôll be fine. 
 TAUB: If she doesn‚Äôt do this and you don‚Äôt make it‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs going to spend the rest of her life blaming herself. 
 [Maggie stares at the ceiling, silent for a moment. Jane looks like she‚Äôs about to cry.] 
 JANE: Mom‚Ä¶ Please. 
 MAGGIE: Find someone else. Let someone else take the risk. 
 [Taub sighs silently and Maggie turns away from him and towards Jane.] 
 [House‚Äôs office. House is playing with a watch when Taub enters.] 
 TAUB: Donor bank turned up a 49 year old man in Cleveland who‚Äôs a five out of six HLA match. First flight out of Cleveland leaves- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts] Why is a 49 year old Cleveland man a closer match than her daughter? 
 TAUB: He may not be. Maggie didn‚Äôt let us test her. 
 HOUSE: [frowns and stop playing with his watch] Why not? 
 TAUB: Pain, danger, risk of- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts again] Only reason to give multiple reasons is you‚Äôre searching for what the person wants to hear. [stares at nothing in particular as the wheels in his mind turn] 
 TAUB: [looks around] House. 
 [House glances up and Taub hands him a wrapped gift. House takes the gift just as Thirteen enters.] 
 HOUSE: You‚Äôre wrong about sainted mommy. 
 THIRTEEN: Don‚Äôt care. You can forget the donor bank, there‚Äôs no CAII deficiency. Best we can do is make her comfortable. 
 [House drops his gaze, pondering for a moment until Thirteen sees the present in his hands.] 
 THIRTEEN: Is that from Taub? 
 HOUSE: [purposefully articulate] Yes. Yes, it is. 
 THIRTEEN: [pulls out a gift as well and sighs, dropping it onto his desk] Merry Christmas. Who‚Äôs going to tell the patient she‚Äôs dying? 
 HOUSE: [gaze lingers on her for a moment and then drops Taub‚Äôs present back onto his desk as well] I will. And nobody leaves here until we find out what k*lled her. 
 [House exits, Taub and Thirteen follow.] 
 [In the lab. The duckies are all running a panel of tests.] 
 KUTNER: Whatever she has is fatal. Makes no difference if it‚Äôs disease number 58 or 907. 
 [Foreman and Taub just look at him. Silence.] 
 KUTNER: You guys mad at me? 
 THIRTEEN: Nope. You had no choice. 
 KUTNER: Of course I had a choice. You had no choice once I made my choice. 
 THIRTEEN: And now I‚Äôm choosing not to be mad at you. 
 KUTNER: Why? 
 THIRTEEN: ‚ÄòCause it will drive House nuts. 
 [Kutner and Taub grin for a moment.] 
 FOREMAN: [frowns] And you think that‚Äôll make your lives better or worse? 
 [Thirteen is speechless for a moment but then Jane walks in and they turn to look at her.] 
 JANE: I told my mom I don‚Äôt care what she thinks. I want you to test my marrow. 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. House is sitting by her bedside.] 
 MAGGIE: I can‚Äôt be dying. 
 HOUSE: Sure you can. 
 MAGGIE: You‚Äôre wrong. [pushing down tears] You don‚Äôt even know what I have. 
 HOUSE: What you have, is one last Christmas with your daughter. One last chance to give her a present. [a purposeful pause] The truth. Inexpensive, highly valued, never have to stand in line to return it the day after Christmas. 
 MAGGIE: What are you talking about? 
 HOUSE: A mother who‚Äôs going to die doesn‚Äôt refuse a donor test because it might hurt. She refuses when she knows it won‚Äôt match. Which tends to happen when mother and daughter aren‚Äôt mother and daughter. 
 [Maggie seems to have no response to that.] 
 HOUSE: I could do DNA tests, if you‚Äôd rather keep lying to me. 
 MAGGIE: [shakes her head, obviously conflicted] I never wanted kids. I love them but with my genes‚Ä¶ I knew this woman, a drug addict. She got pregnant, didn‚Äôt want to have an abortion. But she also didn‚Äôt want her daughter to ever know who her real mother was. What she was. I promised never to tell. 
 HOUSE: A promise to an addict is worth more than a promise to your daughter? 
 MAGGIE: It‚Äôd be cruel to tell her. 
 HOUSE: Right. [shrugs] She lives a lie, you get to die a hypocrite. 
 [Jane enters with Thirteen behind her.] 
 JANE: Mom‚Ä¶ The doctors told me what‚Äôs happening. 
 MAGGIE: It‚Äôs gonna be okay, sweetheart. [nods] I promise you. Doctors can be wrong. There‚Äôs still a chance I can be- 
 JANE: [cuts her off] You really believe that? 
 [House and Thirteen both watch their conversation intently.] 
 MAGGIE: [trying to be strong] I do. 
 JANE: [shakes her head] No, mom. You‚Äôre dying. Nobody can help you. It‚Äôs not going to be okay. 
 [Jane swallows hard and Maggie exhales deeply as the truth sinks into her. House watches them for a moment longer and then gets up, leaving with Thirteen.] 
 THIRTEEN: [in disbelief, softly] That was cold. 
 HOUSE: Yeah. 
 [The Intensive Care Unit labeled door closes behind them.] 
 [House gets off the elevator and steps out into the hospital‚Äôs main lobby. Festive music is playing and the place is all decorated. Nurses and doctors are chatting together as if there is not work to be done. Everyone is happy but he merely frowns and walks up to the receptionist‚Äôs desk. Wilson approaches him, wearing a reindeer hat.] 
 WILSON: What did you get for Christmas? 
 HOUSE: I got a watch, a vintage LP, and a second edition Conan Doyle. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, my patient‚Äôs dying. 
 [House continues heading outside and Wilson follows him.] 
 WILSON: [sighs] Christmas deaths in a hospital, nothing more depressing. No one ever wants to go in the patient‚Äôs room, even the Candy Stripers leave them alone. [shivers from the cold] 
 HOUSE: I saw something amazing. 
 [Wilson looks at him, intrigued.] 
 HOUSE: Pure truth. She told her mother that she was dying. Stripped her of all hope. 
 WILSON: That sounds‚Ä¶ horrible. 
 HOUSE: It‚Äôs like watching some‚Ä¶ bizarre astronomical event that you know you‚Äôre never going to see again. 
 WILSON: [unconvinced] You tell people the cold hard truth all the time. You get off on it. 
 HOUSE: Because I don‚Äôt care. She cared. She did it anyway. [frowns for a second] She did it because she cared. 
 WILSON: [nods sarcastically] The angels of Christmas have finally given House a present he can appreciate. 
 HOUSE: Oh, don‚Äôt ruin it. Don‚Äôt pin this on Christ, he‚Äôs got enough nails in him. [scowls at Wilson‚Äôs reindeer hat] 
 WILSON: Patient had to die but- 
 HOUSE: [cuts him off] Why don‚Äôt you take off that hat? 
 WILSON: It‚Äôs Christmas! It‚Äôs a reindeer. 
 HOUSE: It‚Äôs a moose, on a Jew. 
 WILSON: Who cares? 
 [He tugs on an invisible strong and one of the reindeer‚Äôs horns waves at House.] 
 HOUSE: [sighs] Things have their place. You wouldn‚Äôt hang dreidels on a Christmas tree. 
 WILSON: You could. Things don‚Äôt care. 
 [House thinks about that for a moment and then seems to realize something.] 
 HOUSE: No. They don‚Äôt. [turns and goes back into the hospital] 
 WILSON: Happy Solstice, House. 
 [In the lab. The duckies are still working on tests when they heard House singing ‚ÄúGod Rest Ye Merry Gentleman‚Äù and turn to stare at him.] 
 HOUSE: [enters] To save us all from Satan‚Äôs power, when we were gone astray. Have you people no holiday spirit? Bring me the eggnog of good cheer! 
 FOREMAN: House, if you have something to say, say it. If you don‚Äôt, give us a chance to get home before Santa. 
 HOUSE: [stares at him] Scrooge. Give the patient rispiradone. 
 TAUB: That‚Äôs an anti-psychotic. She‚Äôs dying, she‚Äôs not crazy. 
 HOUSE: I am going to perform a Christmas miracle. 
 [He turns to leave, singing again. The duckies immediately get up to follow him.] 
 [Maggie‚Äôs room. House is feeling under her neck as the duckies look on.] 
 MAGGIE: You said all the causes of osteopetrosis are fatal. 
 HOUSE: Except for the one we discounted early, because it was impossible. When fetus forms, it‚Äôs just a mass of cells. [continues feeling her body, working down her shoulders] Breast tissue covers extensive portions of the body. As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places. [feeling down at her hip now] But sometimes, extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn‚Äôt belong. [down to her legs now] Rispiradone does a lot of things. One is, makes breast tissue swell so we can find it more easily. 
 MAGGIE: You‚Äôre telling me I could have breast cancer? Somewhere not in my breast? That doesn‚Äôt make sense. 
 HOUSE: Taub‚Äôs parents have a winter condo in Florida. They‚Äôre still New Yorkers. 
 TAUB: Actually, my parents- 
 HOUSE: [interrupts] Don‚Äôt care. I told a parable. And now, I‚Äôm going to raise the dead‚Ä¶ 
 [House turns Maggie‚Äôs leg to the side and we see that there is a swollen lump behind her knee.] 
 HOUSE: [to Thirteen] Give me that syringe. 
 THIRTEEN: That‚Äôs gotta be a fat deposit. 
 HOUSE: Yes, I could be wrong. If I am, she‚Äôs dead so shut up. 
 [House inserts the needle into the lump and extracts a white substance. Maggie and Jane both visibly cringe.] 
 TAUB: What‚Äôs that? 
 HOUSE: Rispiradone also causes galacteria. [pulls the needle out] 
 JANE: What‚Äôs that? Galactic‚Ä¶? 
 HOUSE: Open your mouth. 
 [Jane stares at him, hesitant.] 
 HOUSE: Relax, you‚Äôve had it before. 
 JANE: I am not- 
 [House squirts some of the white substance into her mouth. Kutner and Taub both flinch.] 
 JANE: Milk? Eww! [wipes her mouth and chin, obviously disgusted] 
 HOUSE: We‚Äôll cut out your mom‚Äôs tumor and start her on chemo. All the rest of your symptoms should go away. 
 [Maggie nods, relieved. Jane smiles and brushes her hand against her mother‚Äôs cheek.] 
 MAGGIE: I love you. 
 JANE: I know. 
 [Thirteen smiles and watches House, who‚Äôs observing the two like he still amazed by it all.] 
 HOUSE: Have a wonderful life. [exits] 
 [Hospital main lobby. Slow motion, no sound, only music is playing. We see Chase, Cameron, and Foreman talking and laughing with each other. Foreman turns and sees Kutner, Taub, and Thirteen. He beckons them over and Chase raises his drink as a toast. House steps out of the elevator and crosses the lobby, seeing his four employees and two ex-employees all chatting together. They see him as well but he merely gives them a curt nod and continues on his way out in true Scrooge fashion. Outside, he is struck by a thought and he smiles.] 
 [Regular camera speeds now but still no sound, just the holiday music. House walks down the aisle of a church and takes a seat next to a family with a little girl. The church is showing a Christmas play. From the side of the stage, a few people enter. One of which is Melanie, dressed up like the virgin Mary and sitting on top of a donkey. She spots House in the audience and gives him a coy smile as she is helped down from the donkey. He returns her smile with a devilish, knowing smile of his own.]","[' them but with my genes‚Ä¶ I knew this woman, a drug addict. She got pregnant, didn‚Äôt want to have an abortion.

 P.A. Announcer: Come on, Toros. Let's make some noise! 
 Bobby: Nice to meet the pride of Trois-Rivieres. I still got your Wings rookie card. 
 Szabo: So what's that worth? 
 Bobby: It's a collector's item. They don't make them like you anymore. 
 Szabo: So do you wanna go? 
 Bobby: [nods] Square up. Good luck. 
 Linesman: He didn't get a hand on you? You're going to be a force in the show. 
 Toros Fan: Whoo! 
 Spartans Fan: Boo! 
 Toros Fan: Come on, Toros! 
 [In the center of the rink, Szabo has rolled over to his back. He looks around. Bobby, who is just about to enter the penalty box watches and coughs a couple of times. He coughs more deeply and drops to his knees on the ice. One more cough and there‚Äôs a blood on the ice. The next cough adds a few more drops as he lands with his face in a puddle of his own blood.] 
 Linesman: Get a trainer over here! 
 OPENING CREDITS 
 [Cut to House playing table-top hockey by himself. The game is set up on the Diagnostics conference table.] 
 House: Capacity crowd is on its feet. Five seconds on the clock. Ah. How is it possible for one man to be blessed with so much skill? Ahhh. [The imaginary crowd roars] 
 [The team enters and sits down.] 
 Taub: I had one just like this, except it was Bruins and the Habs. Where did you get it? 
 House: [distributing copies of the patient file] Birthday present for someone in pediatric oncology. 22-year-old enforcer with hemoptysis. 
 Adams: He's a hockey player? 
 House: No, he's a superhero. 
 Taub: He's coughing up blood because he probably broke a rib and punctured a lung while breaking someone else's rib and puncturing their lung in the name of sport. 
 House: Nice conclusion to which the E.R. already jumped 18 hours ago. [he sh**t] Short man equals bullied child. 
 Taub: I was average height as a kid and never bullied. 
 Adams: Until now. X-ray ruled out traumatic sequelae, overt TB, and lung cancer. 
 Chase: Sarcoidosis. Nodules could be too small to show up on an X-ray. Fighting's the best part of hockey. Without it, you've got the Ice Capades. 
 Taub: Fighting has nothing to do with hockey. It's like the cheerleaders at a basketball game. 
 Chase: Cheerleading's the best part of basketball. Without it you've got‚Ä¶ basketball. 
 Adams: He's a duck hunter. He could've contracted psittacosis from exposure to fowl. 
 Taub: He had three teeth knocked out two weeks ago. Infection could've led to oral bleeding. 
 Park: Not without continuing dental pain. 
 Taub: Then he took an elbow to the gut, which caused an esophageal tear. 
 House: Chase, CT the patient. Check for sarcoid. [He tosses Chase one of the hockey players from the game.] Adams, sputum cultures and serologies for psittacosis. Taub‚Ä¶ I'd tell you why I think your theory is not just wrong but ill-conceived, but it's more fun to prove it by having you check the stool for blood. And while we wait for the stool fairy, I'm a man down, so you want to drop your pants and hit the ice. 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub and Adams are interviewing Bobby.] 
 Bobby: The faster you guys can do this, the better. The NHL's been sniffing around, and being in the hospital is not really helping my marketability. 
 Adams: You have to be pretty good to get called up. 
 Bobby: Yeah, leading the league in penalty minutes. 
 Taub: And visits to the E.R., not counting the ones you've caused. 
 Bobby: Not a hockey fan, I gather? 
 Taub: I am. That's the point. Fighting cheapens a great sport. 
 Bobby: Oh, come on, that's like saying passing cheapens football. It's part of the game. I don't cause injuries. 
 Taub: They're self-inflicted? 
 Bobby: No, I prevent them. I take the hit so the smaller guys don't have to. I thought you'd appreciate that. 
 [Cut to Wilson‚Äôs office. House opens the door. The room is dark and Wilson is asleep on the sofa. He wakes up, squinting, as House turns on the light and closes the door.] 
 House: Neighbor's baby again? 
 Wilson: I could hear it through earplugs, two pillows, and three sleeping pills. 
 House: Hmm. 
 Wilson: [exasperated] What is wrong with you? 
 House: I just said, ""hmm."" 
 Wilson: You're trying to figure out some deeper significance to my having a couple of crappy nights. 
 House: Which one of us is analyzing the word ""hmm"" here? 
 Wilson: [waves House off] Fine. Sorry. 
 House: Apology accepted. However‚Ä¶ 
 Wilson: Mm. 
 House: It's not the crying that's keeping you awake. The sound of a needy child is stirring your paternal juices. 
 Wilson: The sound of a needy child at 112 decibels has stirred my inner m*rder*r. Don't mess with me. 
 House: Explain the stains on your shirt. You're lactating. The fact that you're the only fruit on your family tree is getting to you. 
 Wilson: It's not a big deal. So I'll probably never be a dad. It's‚Äìit sucks. I'll lose a little sleep, but‚Äî 
 House: You're not supposed to feel bad when you dodge a b*llet. It's like you got survivor's guilt. 
 Wilson: There are actually things in this world that give life even more meaning than soap operas and monster trucks. And we happen to be missing out on at least one of them. 
 [Wilson covers his eyes with his arm. House looks at him for a long moment, thinking about something.] 
 House: Remember the falconer? 
 Wilson: Beth? 
 House: You dated two falconers? Yes, Beth. The night the two of you split up, you came around to my place, wallowing in self-pity and tequila. You passed out. She called that night, asked me to give you a message. She said she was pregnant‚Ä¶ Which, God and Planned Parenthood willing, means you are the father of an 11-year-old. [Long pause as Wilson takes in this information.] I told you the next morning‚Ä¶ hypothetically. I asked you how you'd feel if Beth had gotten pregnant, and you said, and I quote, ""It would be the worst mistake of my life."" 
 Wilson: And‚Ä¶ scene. Two performances Sunday, dark Mondays? 
 House: Just as well. 
 [House gets up and leaves. Despite saying that House was acting, Wilson looks like he‚Äôs considering the news.] 
 [Cut to Bobby getting a CT. Chase and Park are monitoring him.] 
 Park: I want to k*ll my mother. My Popo's on her own, and my mother always needs me to take care of her. 
 Chase: Well, you could k*ll Popo instead. 
 Park: I have to take her shopping, to her friends, to Atlantic City. I love her, but every night, every weekend‚Ä¶ 
 Chase: And only if there was some solution, someplace where you could live‚Ä¶ that's not there. 
 Park: My mom would freak. It would be the ultimate sign of disrespect. 
 Chase: Okay. Then stay. And maybe you consider not bitching about it? 
 Park: Not everyone's lucky enough to have your independence. 
 Chase: Don't worry. When you lose your family, you'll have it too. 
 Park: [looking at the screen] He doesn't have sarcoid. 
 Chase: Look at that. 
 Park: That's his spleen. 
 Chase: I know. But he's gotten it supersized. 
 [Cut to the team following House into his office.] 
 Taub: Deep vein thrombosis caused by any one of his many injuries or surgeries. 
 Park: Leukemia's a better fit. 
 Taub: We have a guy who is punishing his body on a daily basis. Don't you think that's a more likely cause than cancer? 
 Adams: No, because she doesn't have an agenda. 
 House: [to Adams] Well, that was incredibly unprofessional. Well, it was really Taub's fault. [Taub stops smirking] If you're not prepared to slam her into the boards, she's got no reason not to go after you. Might I suggest pulling her jersey over her head first? 
 Chase: We should get an ultrasound for DVT and WBC for leukemia. 
 [House waves for them to do it.] 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub is drawing blood.] 
 Bobby: You think I could have cancer? 
 Taub: More likely, it's just a DVT. 
 [Bobby‚Äôs cell phone, which is on his bed, rings.] 
 Bobby: This is my agent. I gotta get this, man. Give me some good news, Kenny. I thought you said any day. Okay. All right. [As Bobby talks, Taub notices something under his robe. He pulls the front open. Bobby has pronounced breasts. Bobby looks down and sees them.] I gotta go. 
 [Cut to the balcony outside House and Wilson‚Äôs offices. It‚Äôs night. Wilson is looking into the distance. House comes out.] 
 Wilson: I called Beth. I have an 11-year-old son. 
 [END OF ACT ONE] 
 [ACT TWO] 
 [Cut to Diagnostics. House is at the table, with an open Macbook. The team enters.] 
 Chase: Liver failure could alter hormone levels, cause abnormal breast development. 
 Park: Alcoholism. We should search his home and locker room. 
 House: Note that the person who wants to search the home didn't sleep in one last night. You have the imprint of a seatbelt buckle in your cheek. 
 Park: I got in a fight with my mother. 
 House: She hit you with a seatbelt? 
 Chase: Could be hemochromatosis. 
 Adams: Explains the liver and the spleen, but hemoptysis is a stretch. What about leptospirosis? 
 Taub: That's a good fit, if you ignore the fact that he's a pro athlete who looks like the Incredible Hulk, which means he's gotta be on steroids, which is a better fit. 
 House: All we really know for sure is it was his evil job that caused the problems. 
 Taub: Yes, I don't like him. Doesn't mean my judgment's affected. 
 House: Maybe. Let's take a look at the instant replay. [He turns the computer around and plays a video of Szabo checking Wallace.] This is the hit that precipitated Booby Orr's fight. Dirty or clean? 
 [They all watch.] 
 Taub: The hit was clean. 
 Adams: Really? The guy released the puck at least a second before the hit. 
 Taub: We have a difference of opinion. That's all. 
 House: Absolutely. Maybe she's as biased as you. Or maybe the entire league is. [He hands Taub a document.] After review, the league disciplinary commissioner ruled the hit illegal and dangerous and suspended the player for three games. Adams and Taub, run antibody titers for lepto. Chase and Park, check out the home, the locker room for booze, steroids, and Taub's objectivity. 
 [Cut to the Toros‚Äô locker room. Chase and Park are inspecting the lockers, shelves, carrying bags, etc.] 
 Chase: At least you're free. Going to get your own place? 
 Park: If I can find a place I can afford, so‚Ä¶ no. 
 Chase: If you want, you can crash at my place in the spare bedroom. 
 Park: That might be kind of weird. 
 Chase: I live in an apartment, not a dungeon. 
 Park: It's just two single people, opposite sex. I‚Äî 
 Chase: Your bedroom door has a lock on the inside. [Park looks at an athletic cup she pulled from a bag. She quickly drops it.] Hey, if you prefer your car, be my guest. 
 [Park unzips another bag and finds a drugstore bag.] 
 Park: Scrip for glanciclovir. If his neighbor has mono, could mean he has mono. If he has mono, explains his spleen and hemoptysis. And it's caused by Epstein-Barr virus, which explains his liver. And my moonroof leaks. Thank you. 
 [Apparently after a few months working for House, Park has learned how to accept a favor from someone.] 
 [Cut to a toy store. House and Wilson are shopping.] 
 House: Why don't we just assume that you're not the dad? [Wilson takes out his phone and shows House a picture. House studies it for a moment.] Either you're the dad, or she cheated on you with your dad. 
 Wilson: Oh! Sand art. I used to love this. 
 House: He's bitter, not mentally handicapped. Who knows what Beth told him about you? At worst, you're a r*pist. At best, you're a r*pist. 
 Wilson: Maybe she said I was a dead w*r hero. 
 House: Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father. Oh, I know! Squirrel handcuffs. You think he's gotten any of those? 
 Wilson: If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information, then why did you give it to me? 
 House: Because you were pining for a kid, and you deserved to know that you already had one. But your parental cravings are more theoretical than applied. You want vicarious immortality more than you want a lifelong burden. 
 Wilson: You're assuming he's going to be a nightmare. What if he's a good kid? 
 House: He's a kid. Best you can hope for is he's a nightmare. 
 Wilson: House, I'm not naive. I realize that this thing could go very badly, but the point is my son wants to meet me. And I want to meet him. 
 [He walks off.] 
 [Cut to Chase‚Äôs apartment. He enters and drops his messenger bag by the door. He sees an elderly, Asian woman sitting on the couch, knitting. She watches him, soundlessly.] 
 Chase: Popo, I presume. 
 [Popo nods and keeps knitting. Park enters from the spare bedroom.] 
 Park: Hey, uh, I let myself in. Um, this is‚Äî 
 Chase: We've met. [quietly] I thought the whole point of this was to get away from Popo. 
 Park: My dad's getting a cyst removed, and my mother had to take him to the clinic. Don't worry. She'll be gone in an hour. 
 Chase: I'm not worried, because it's not my issue. [looks at Popo] She seems awfully quiet. 
 Park: You haven't seen her drunk. 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub enters and looks around. He doesn‚Äôt see anyone but hears someone crying. He looks on the far side of the bed. Bobby is there, sitting on the floor, crying quietly.] 
 Taub: Bobby? 
 ** 
 [Cut to Diagnostics the next morning. The team is doing a DDX. House enters and, ignoring them, goes to his office to drop his backpack and flip through his mail.] 
 Taub: I found him crying in the fetal position. 
 Park: It's not a new symptom. He's crying because his liver failure threw his hormones out of whack. 
 Adams: Aside from the crying, he's actually recovering nicely. 
 Taub: Aside from the guy in the book depository, the Kennedys had a lovely trip to Dallas. Repetitive blows to the head can cause chronic traumatic encephalopathy, symptoms of which are aggressive behavior and depression. 
 House: So your theory is that his aggressive behavior caused his aggressive behavior. He's not depressed. He's just bummed because he knows he's a talentless moron who's only one lost fight away from being a barista. I understand that can get to a guy after a while. 
 [He drops all the mail, unopened, into the trash.] 
 Taub: If he quits being an enforcer, it could save his life. 
 House: You don't want to save his life. [joining them] You want to k*ll his career. 
 Park: I moved into Chase's apartment. [Chase looks up.] He knows. He was staring at our matching cups. I told you we should split up. We're not having sex. With each other‚Ä¶ 
 House: Yet. 
 Park: Yes. 
 Chase: [what???] Yes? 
 Park: I just mean no one knows the future right now, so we don't really know‚Ä¶ The only conclusive test for CTE is post-mortem. 
 Taub: But an MRI of his brain could reveal white matter disintegrity, which is the effect of CTE. 
 House: Why? Are you trying to sleep with her? 'Cause the simpler technique is just to ask. 
 Chase: I was doing something nice. 
 House: Mm, no. Th‚Äî mm. No, that doesn't fit. 
 Adams: He's only had three concussions since he was ten. It's not enough to cause CTE. 
 Chase: Three reported concussions. These guys are taught in high school how to dupe the tests. 
 House: Guilt? 
 Park: This is really insulting. 
 Chase: It's not guilt. Park is a friend. 
 House: So it's guilt. Chase convinced you to leave mommy, and now he feels responsible. No MRI. Do a psych eval. If he doesn't start weeping again, send him home. 
 [Cut to a diner. Wilson is in a booth, looking out the window.] 
 Duncan: Dr. Wilson? 
 Wilson: Duncan. Uh, James. 
 [They shake hands and Duncan sits opposite Wilson. Duncan is a thin, good-looking boy with lots of brown hair. He doesn‚Äôt have Wilson‚Äôs mile-high cheekbones but otherwise does look like him.] 
 Duncan: Uh, n-n-nice to meet you. 
 Wilson: It's nice to meet you. Um‚Ä¶ How are you doing? 
 Duncan: Good. 
 Wilson: Good. I got you this. 
 [He hands Duncan a book-shaped package with yellow wrapping paper.] 
 Duncan: Oh. Thank you. 
 Wilson: Go ahead. 
 Duncan: Okay. 
 [He unwraps Gamedeck, a computer game console.] 
 Wilson: It's got three games built in, but you can download more from the website. 
 Duncan: Yeah, I know. 
 Wilson: You already have one. 
 Duncan: I can always use a backup. 
 Waitress: Hi, can I start you with something to drink? 
 Duncan: Just water, please. 
 Waitress: You got a Gamedeck? Way to go, Dad. 
 Taub: According to your psych eval, the only thing happier than you is Disneyland. 
 Bobby: I'm sorry you had to see me like that last night. I'm just upset about being in the hospital and‚Ä¶ I'm on some weird meds, but they must be working, because I'm feeling a lot better now. 
 Taub: Depression could be the symptom of a serious illness. CTE. 
 Bobby: Yeah, my aunt sends me every article she can find on it. 
 Taub: And you know it could k*ll you. 
 Bobby: In the long run, like a lot of things. 
 Taub: You might be right. And an MRI could confirm that. 
 Bobby: I have enough evidence of head trauma in my file already, so‚Ä¶ 
 [Cut to the diner.] 
 Duncan: My mom said you had trouble maintaining relationships with normal people. She also said you were a nice guy. I always figured she was lying 'cause she didn't want me to hate my deadbeat dad. 
 Wilson: I didn't know‚Äî 
 Duncan: I-I know‚Ä¶ now. 
 Wilson: You're a bright kid. 
 Duncan: Thanks to you. Thanks to my mom, I'm also a big, soft-hearted wuss. 
 Wilson: [laughs] I think you may have gotten that from both of us. 
 Duncan: Uh, I gotta go, but it was really nice meeting you. 
 Wilson: It was nice meeting you, Duncan. 
 Duncan: Uh, you want to hang out again? 
 Wilson: [laughs] Absolutely. 
 Duncan: Tonight? 
 Wilson: Tonight? Well, I-I-there's, um‚Ä¶ [He looks at Duncan who is trying not to look like it‚Äôs important to him.] That would be great. 
 Duncan: Okay. I'll text you. 
 [He leaves.] 
 [Cut to the MRI room. Chase is observing. Taub enters.] 
 Taub: Thank you. How did you talk him into it? 
 Chase: He agreed once I promised him anonymity. [hands Taub a file] Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked the name John apparently. Unfortunately we just wasted his time and proved House right. 
 Taub: Nothing? [points to the screen] What about that? 
 Chase: That's an artifact. 
 Taub: That's a density. I know you think I'm convincing myself, but this brain has been hammered for years, meaning evidence may be subtle, but it's there. 
 House: [voice] Meaning you see what you want to see. [Taub turns on another monitor. House is getting the MRI.] Unless, of course, Chase is an idiot, and I do have brain damage. 
 [Taub‚Äôs and Chase‚Äôs beepers go off.] 
 Chase: Patient's stroking out. 
 [They leave.] 
 House: Chase? Can you get me out of‚Äî Ohh‚Ä¶ Hello? 
 [House, on the monitor, tries to figure out how to get out of an MRI machine.] 
 ** 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. House is moving his finger for Bobby to follow with his eyes.] 
 House: The good news is, it's isolated ophthalmoplegia, which means you didn't have a stroke. [House replaces the eye patch.] Bad news is, Taub was right. You're still sick. [to Taub] I said ""right,"" not ""competent."" Bursts your CTE bubble. You're going to need a whole new theory to keep Uncle Jesse and his Olsen twins on the bench. 
 Taub: Can we discuss my incompetence somewhere else? 
 Bobby: Dr. House. Could I talk to you for a minute? 
 [Cut to Chase and Taub in the hall. After he talks to Bobby, House joins them.] 
 Taub: Could be neurosyphilis. 
 Chase: He's only 22. 
 Taub: And he's been on the road since he was 14. 
 House: So he was trash even before he was trash? You curious about what he wanted? 
 Taub: I assume he wanted me off the case, and you told him I was hit in the head as a child, and your mother made you promise to take care of me. 
 House: He was doing what he always does ‚Äî sticking up for the little guy. He told me to apologize to you, or he would‚Ä¶ excrete down my throat. I'm paraphrasing. [Taub looks puzzled.] So if he should ask, I was a gentleman, or I will excrete down your throat. 
 Chase: Microscopic polyangiitis fits. 
 Taub: We should start plasmapheresis immediately. 
 Chase: We need to run an ANCA panel to confirm first. Putting him on plasmapheresis could make him bleed out. 
 Taub: MPA can progress quickly. We may not have time before it reaches his lungs. 
 House: I think you're right. Thus confirming my objectivity. Start the treatment. 
 [House and Chase leave. Taub waves slightly to Bobby, then leaves.] 
 [Cut to the cafeteria. House joins Wilson in a booth.] 
 House: Miserable yet? 
 Wilson: He‚Äôs polite, well-adjusted and a straight-A student. 
 House: Which means he doesn't need you. So why don't you get out while the butterfly effect is still in the cocoon stage? 
 Wilson: I'm making him dinner. 
 House: You don't make an 11-year-old dinner. You give him a jar of peanut butter. 
 Wilson: It'll be fine. I could give this kid a quinoa salad, and he would eat it just to be nice. 
 House: 'Cause he's a gutless placater, just like his dad. 
 Wilson: He's nice. 
 House: This is a terrible idea. 
 Wilson: Because we like each other? 
 House: Yes. 'Cause of the statement ""we like each other."" You've known him 25 minutes. All you know about him is that he'd lie about a quinoa salad, whatever the hell that is. 
 Wilson: You're jealous of an 11-year-old because you are an 11-year-old. 
 [House stops chewing and opens his mouth wide to show Wilson the food inside.] 
 [Cut to Wilson‚Äôs condo. Wilson and Duncan are making pizza.] 
 Wilson: So tell me about yourself. I mean, you're smart, you're nice, but what else? 
 Duncan: I don't know. I'm a kid. 
 Wilson: Right. [Duncan looks at the toppings Wilson has laid out.] What are you looking for? 
 Duncan: Nothing. 
 Wilson: You want‚Ä¶ peanut butter? 
 Duncan: Do you have prosciutto? 
 Wilson: You like prosciutto? 
 Duncan: I'm weird. 
 Wilson: No, no. I-I like it too. I've got some in the fridge. 
 Duncan: How about goat cheese? 
 Wilson: [chuckles happily] I love goat cheese. 
 Wilson: I think that was the best pizza I ever had. 
 [Wilson heads for the refrigerator. Duncan smiles.] 
 [Cut to Wilson‚Äôs car.] 
 Wilson: I think that was the best pizza I ever had. 
 Duncan: It was the hint of Dijon. 
 Wilson: Do you have any aunts or uncles or grandparents? 
 Duncan: My mom got into some stupid fight with my grandfather. They all kind of cut us off. 
 Wilson: Hmmph. 
 Duncan: Are you talking to your parents? 
 Wilson: Yes, and they're going to be very surprised and excited to meet you. 
 Duncan: That's awesome. 
 GPS Voice: You have arrived at your destination. 
 Wilson: Well‚Äî 
 Duncan: Thanks for the pizza. 
 Wilson: Sure, sure. It was, uh‚Äî I mean, it was great to spend time with you and‚Äî 
 [Duncan hugs Wilson.] 
 Duncan: I love you, Dad. 
 [Duncan gets out of the car. Wilson laughs a little to himself.] 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub is monitoring him and bonding.] 
 Taub: Can't be easy doing what you do. I mean, do you love it? Is it fun? I had my own plastic surgery practice making lots of money, but I wasn't happy. It wasn't what I went to med school for. 
 Bobby: [long pause] Every winter my dad would flood the backyard and made a rink. I was Lemieux. My little brother was Gretzky. I was good. I won the NDHA scoring title three years in a row. I kept getting bigger and stronger and better‚Ä¶ ‚Äôtil I didn't. My Juniors coach told me that, if I wanted to stay on the team, then I'd have to use my size. Every game, I got less and less ice time until it was all fighting and no hockey. I, uh‚Ä¶ [looks around] There's something going on with my arms. I can't feel them. I‚Äî Doctor, I can't feel my arms. 
 [END OF ACT FOUR] 
 [ACT FIVE] 
 [Cut to Diagnostics the next morning. The team is doing a DDX. House enters. He swings his backpack to get some momentum going and tosses it behind him, into his office.] 
 Taub: Patient's arms are now paralyzed. ANCA panel was negative. It's not MPA. 
 Adams: Lyme disease could cause paralysis. If he was hunting, he'd be exposed to ticks. 
 House: No target rash or cardiac involvement. [to Chase] Roomies with benefits keeping you up? 
 Chase: Cribbage. I played with Park's Popo. 
 House: Is that two separate events? 
 Chase: Grandmother. ALS could explain the symptoms. 
 Park: Sensory involvement rules out ALS. 
 House: Okay, yeah. Now this is interesting. We'll get back to the patient in a second. Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except‚Ä¶ you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks. You don't feel guilty about getting Park thrown out of her home. You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over. My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires. 
 Chase: Park's a friend. Popo's fun. 
 Taub: Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms, meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark of botulism. 
 House: So it was something he ate. How innocuous. You've overcome your bias by reversing it. The only problem is that being in love with a patient is just as judgmental as being in hate. We didn't find any contaminated‚Äî 
 Taub: No contaminated food. I'm not an idiot. But what if it's not from ingesting but from injecting? He was treated for intractable muscle spasms by the team's trainers. Sometimes they use botox. 
 Adams: We need to start the antitoxin‚Äî 
 Taub: The antitoxin could cause anaphylaxis. We need to test first to confirm. 
 House: As if to prove my point, last time you said there wasn't enough time to test prior to a more dangerous treatment. 
 Taub: It's a different situation, different symptom, different diagnosis. 
 House: Different emotion. Give him the antitoxin. 
 [He leaves. Taub lifts his hands in a ‚Äúwhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI give up‚Äù gesture.] 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub is there. Park enters.] 
 Park: Anything? 
 Taub: No adverse effects. 
 [Park rolls a stool over and sits down.] 
 Park: Chase let me move in with him to get away from my grandmother. Then he practically let my grandmother move in with the both of us. He's being way more than nice. 
 Taub: Then which answer is it? Chase feels guilty for pushing you to move out? 
 Park: He didn't push me. 
 Taub: Guilt about skanks. 
 Park: He loves skanks. 
 Taub: It's not the other option. 
 Park: There are people that like me. People even want to sleep with me. Some of them are even good-looking. 
 Taub: That good-looking? [Park tries to answer but no words come out. Bobby‚Äôs forefinger moves.] Did you see that? [to Bobby] You're feeling something? 
 Bobby: [who has been awake through this entire conversation] Yeah. 
 [Cut to House and Wilson in the elevator.] 
 Wilson: I could give you crap for making me wait 11 years, but instead I'm going to thank you for not making me wait another 11. 
 House: Every little girl wants a pony till they have to clean up after it. 
 Wilson: You think I'm going to quit on this? On an 11-year-old? 
 House: The only relationship you haven't quit on has been with me. 
 Wilson: Hmm. A needy, truculent narcissist. I think it's been perfect training for parenthood. 
 House: [stares at him, serious] That's not even close. This is the rest of your life. You screw this up, you don't get to run away. You get to ruin both your lives. This is a bigger responsibility than any you've ever taken on and screwed up. 
 Wilson: I know. That's why I'm so excited about it. 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. Taub has moved the table-top hockey game there. He and Bobby are playing.] 
 Bobby: You're really happier doing this than looking at boobs all day? 
 Taub: Luckily I get patients like you every now and again who let me reexperience the joy. 
 Bobby: You know, the best part of my day is when I'm sitting in that penalty box after I beat someone up. That's the only time I know I'm safe. Think Lemieux ever felt that way? I'm not going back. 
 Taub: To hockey? 
 Bobby: To enforcing‚Ä¶ whatever that costs. 
 Taub: Good for you. [he sh**t] Ooh! First goal for the pocket rocket. Bobby? [Bobby is holding his chest and having trouble breathing.] We need a team in here! 
 [END OF ACT FIVE] 
 [ACT SIX] 
 [Cut to Diagnostics. House enters.] 
 Taub: He's completely paralyzed, and he tested negative for botulism. 
 House: I am now accepting long sh*ts. 
 Adams: Polio. Some kids were never vaccinated. 
 Taub: Unless they played sports all their lives and had two physicals a year. 
 Park: How about MLD? 
 Taub: That's a bad fit. I say that not because there's no treatment for MLD but because it's a bad fit. His cognitive abilities are unaffected. 
 Chase: Prion disease could explain the waxing and waning symptoms. 
 Taub: The test for Prions is a brain biopsy. Given his history, there's got to be brain swelling. We can't risk drilling into his skull. 
 House: Pretty sure we can. 
 Taub: We also could keep talking until we can find an answer we all can agree on. 
 House: All of us? Those who love him, those who hate him, those who don't give a crap about him or you‚Äî 
 Taub: Or I could just discuss it on my own with Foreman. 
 House: He's not your friend. 
 Taub: I get it. He's a patient. I'm not‚Äî 
 House: He never had your back. He didn't insist that I apologize to you. He asked me to take you off the case. [Taub takes in this information.] Biopsy his brain. 
 [Cut to the diner. Duncan joins Wilson at the counter.] 
 Duncan: Hey, Dad. 
 Wilson: Hey. 
 Duncan: Sorry I'm late. Got in a fight with my mom. She's such a tool. 
 Wilson: I'm sure she means well. 
 Duncan: She wants to open a reserve in Costa Rica for rescued birds of prey. 
 Wilson: But how serious is she? From my recollection, she used to talk about doing a lot‚Äî 
 Duncan: Yeah, but she bought plane tickets for Monday. 
 Wilson: [after a couple of false starts] Well, Costa Rica is beautiful. And the schools are supposed to be great. 
 Duncan: Oh, I'm not going. It's her stupid dream, not mine. 
 Wilson: Then what will you do? 
 Duncan: Uh‚Ä¶ I-I thought maybe I could, uh‚Ä¶ Maybe I could stay with you? Uh, y-your place is only 3 miles away from my school. I could bus it every day. [Wilson starts shaking his head slightly.] And I do my own laundry. I keep my room tidy. 
 Wilson: Duncan, th-this-this is very sudden. 
 Duncan: I know. I'm sorry. [pause] Please don't send me to the jungle. 
 [Wilson stops shaking his head and sits up a little straighter.] 
 Wilson: If it's okay with your mother, it's okay with me. 
 [Duncan grabs him in a hug.] 
 [Cut to House‚Äôs office.] 
 Taub: Take me off the case. I've obviously completely lost my objectivity. I'm not helping, I'm not even neutral. 
 House: Agreed. So why shouldn't I take you off all my cases? 
 Taub: Because you were right. I hate bullies. 
 House: You work for me. 
 Taub: You're not a bully. 
 House: Pretty sure I am, dickwad. 
 Taub: I've known a lot of bullies ‚Äî people who didn't like me because I'm short, people who didn't like me because I'm Jewish‚Äî 
 House: Yeah, I get it. There's a long list of reasons not to like you. 
 Taub: You relentlessly mock, but it's not for self-aggrandizement. It's because ideas are bigger than feelings. At least that's what I choose to believe. I also thought you had the side effect of desensitizing me. 
 [He starts to leave.] 
 House: You little Hebe. Here's some ideas for you. You screwed up. You kept on screwing up. Everything you said is true, except‚Ä¶ it doesn't mean you walk away. You just learn to trust nothing. Everything you think you feel, everything you think you know. Question every call, play through every whistle. 
 [Taub almost turns toward the door again when he gets a ‚Äúeureka‚Äù expression.] 
 Taub: I just had a light bulb. Maybe. 
 House: You can trust light bulbs. 
 [Cut to the OR. Taub rushes in, followed by House.] 
 Taub: Stop. It's not prions. Epstein-Barr gave him mono. It also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome. The plasmapheresis played through the whistle. We gave it to him for MPA, but when he got worse, we took him off. When he got better, we thought it was the antitoxin. But it was actually the plasmapheresis still working. We had the right treatment, just the wrong diagnosis. 
 House: It was my metaphor that solved the case. Put him back on plasmapheresis. He'll be fine. Nice save. Didn't quite make up for being a sieve the rest of the game. 
 [House leaves. Chase starts to remove the cage holding Bobby‚Äôs head in place for the biopsy.] 
 [Cut to Wilson‚Äôs office. He‚Äôs lying in the dark again. House enters and flips on the light.] 
 House: Ex-girlfriend's baby again? 
 Wilson: His mother is moving to Costa Rica. He asked if he could move in with me. [mirthless chuckle] And I said yes. 
 House: Well, it's only six or seven years. Unless he can't get into college, in which case, it's more a matter of your life expectancy. 
 Wilson: I said yes, knowing I'm not remotely ready for that, knowing he's not ready to be separated from his mother. This isn't the act of a mature, rational adult. I-I can't do this, House. You were right. 
 House: I have an idea‚Ä¶ that can make this entire problem go away. 
 Wilson: Yes, I really want to hear your clever late-term abortion joke. You were right about everything. This is life. It's real. It doesn't just go away. 
 House: None of that is true. 
 [He opens the door and jerks his head in a ‚Äúcome here‚Äù gestures. Duncan, who is on a bench in the hall, come in. He‚Äôs holding an 9x12 manila envelope.] 
 Duncan: Hey. 
 Wilson: Duncan. 
 Duncan: Actually‚Ä¶ Wendel. [He opens the envelope and pulls out a headshot with his credits printed on the back of the photo.] One ""l."" If you're going to get pissy, remember, it was House's idea. 
 Wilson: You're an actor? 
 Duncan: [proudly] Five commercials and a recurring on Days of Our Lives. 
 House: You were regretting not having kids, so I gave you one‚Ä¶ thereby rendering you regret-free. It's a priceless gift. 
 Wilson: Get out. 
 House: Well, it's not priceless 'cause he charges SAG minimum. 
 Wilson: [very angry] Get out! 
 Duncan: Chillax, Dad. 
 House: Can you do an Australian accent? 
 [House and Duncan leave. Wilson, still staring at the picture, sinks onto his couch. He flips the photo toward the table and sits there, thinking. He chuckles softly.] 
 [Cut to Bobby‚Äôs room. 
 Bobby: I just got the call. Three-year deal. $2.1 million. 
 [Taub looks impressed but‚Ä¶] 
 Taub: What about the flooded backyard and pretending to be Lemieux? 
 Bobby: That's why I took it. After all I did to get here, half a dream is better than nothing. Maybe my new coach will see what my Juniors coach didn't. 
 Taub: That'd be nice. 
 [Cut to Chase and Park in the elevator. He‚Äôs looking at the door, she‚Äôs looking at him.] 
 Park: [after a pause] I'm not sleeping with you. 
 Chase: That's a shame. 
 Park: [realizing something] This is about Popo. 
 Chase: She's not sleeping with me either, right? 
 Park: You were jealous of me. My family. 
 Chase: [confessing] Maybe you've got too much, and I've got too little. 
 [They get off the elevator and head for home.] 
 Park: I might sleep with you after all. 
 [Montage to Lee Dorsey's Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky] 
 [Chase and Popo play cribbage. She is smiling. He takes a sip from his drink. She picks up her glass and they clink glasses.] 
 ‚ô™‚ô´ Everything I do gon' be funky 
 ‚ô™‚ô´ From now on 
 ‚ô™‚ô´ Yeah 
 [The front door of a house opens. Park is on the doorstep. Her mother, who opened the door, steps back to let Park come back home.] 
 Wilson: The woman that I called ‚Äî that was really Beth? 
 House: Found her on Facebook. 
 Wilson: How much did she charge? 
 House: Nothing. She's still pissed at you. 
 House: Pass the bacon. 
 Wilson: I thought you liked prosciutto. 
 House: Nobody likes prosciutto.","[""at can make this entire problem go away. \n Wilson: Yes, I really want to hear your clever late-term abortion joke. You were right about everything. This is life. It's real. It doesn't just go away. \n House: N""]",True
scrubs_5_16,285403,5,16,"Nurses' Station. Turk walks through with a tracking device that is beeping. 
 Elliot: What is that? 
 Turk: This here is an electronic hide and seek game. The other person wears a sensor and the closer you get, the more it beeps. 
 Elliot: Ah. Funsies. So Mrs. Facter here has a ??? and needs a surgical consult. 
 (Turk switches off the tracker.) 
 Turk: Fire away. 
 Elliot: See her red highlights? 
 Turk: Yes. 
 Elliot: Could I pull those off or am I so kidding myself? 
 Turk: I really don't have time for this. 
 Elliot: Turk, you're playing hide and seek. 
 Turk: with my nine year-old gleoblastoma patient, Eric. He's been in the hospital for a month. I think he deserves a little fun, don't you? 
 Elliot: Sorry, Turk. 
 (Turk switches the tracker back on and walks on. The beeping gets faster as he approaches a storage cabinet.) 
 Turk: Hee hee hee hee! 
 (Turk opens the cabinet and finds J.D.) 
 J.D.: How bad would she look with red highlights? 
 Turk: I know. It is now my turn to hide. 
 (They exchange the tracker and sensor.) 
 J.D.: All right, I'll count. Close a brother up. 
 (Turk closes the cabinet, then runs away. Cut to ICU.) 
 Elliot: So, I like to remember all of the carpal bones in the hand with a simple mnemonic device: Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetrum, Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate and Hamate. Some Lovers Try Positions that They Can't Handle.

 Dr. Cox: Excuse me, but does anyone here happen to have a plate of Jeebies? Because these two here just have me a big, old scoop of the Heebies. Seriously, it cannot just be me. 
 (Dr. Cox speaks into a pen like a microphone, imitating a talk show host.) 
 Dr. Cox: I want to hear from the audience, I do. Dating in the workplace: She's the boss, he's the pretty intern, tell me what's bugging you. Courage. 
 (Dr. Cox points the pen at Gloria. Gloria clears her throat.) 
 Gloria: Well, sometimes they arrive in the morning and they smell like sex. 
 Dr. Cox: Gloria, telling it like it smells. I'm proud of you. Barbie, who hurt you? 
 Elliot: Is there something you want? 
 (Dr. Cox throws the pen away.) 
 Dr. Cox: Actually, yes. It is one of those rare days where you can be of use to me. You speak German, I have a patient from Berlin, and I need to tell the gentleman he has fluid in his lungs.

 Dr. Cox: Schoenen busen. How are you?

 (Cut back to apartment. The microwave beeps. Carla looks at the test.) 
 Carla: It's negative. 
 Turk: Look at me. Hey, look at me. It's gonna happen. 
 Carla: Eat your pizza rolls. I gotta get to work. 
 (She throws the test in the trash.) 
 Carla: By the way, next time buy a name-brand pregnancy test, not that cheap generic one. 
 Turk: If you would raise my allowance, I wouldn't have to bargain shop so I could buy pizza rolls. Secondly, this pregnancy test works just as well as the name-brand one! 
 (Carla exits.) 
 Turk: Wait a second. [reading the box] Results in three minutes. 
 (Cut to hallway. Dr. Cox gets ejected forcefully out of a room against the wall.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: Some things deserve to get tossed out on their asses. 
 Dr. Cox: OH! Oooh! Schoenen busen. 
 (Cut to Turk's and Carla'a apartment. Turk digs through the trash for the pregnancy test.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: But the thing you shouldn't toss out is a pregnancy test that takes two minutes longer than you thought. 
 (Turk looks at the test. It changes from pink to blue.) 
 Turk: [stunned] Oh my God, we're pregnant. 
 (He collapses on a stool and absentmindedly eats a still-hot pizza roll.) 
 Turk: WAAHAAA! AAAAAHAAAAAAHAAAAAA!! 
 Admissions Area. 
 Laverne: Mr. Roberts and I just love our above ground pool. In high school I was actually an all-state swimmer. 
 Todd: Breaststroke five! Maybe later. 
 J.D.'s Narration: Every workplace has that guy who just has t top everyone's story. 
 Janitor: When I was 19, I was a world-class 110-meter hurdler. 
 (Flashback: a track meet, circa 1984. Janitor is wearing a tracksuit, an 80's style haircut and mustache and smoking a cigarette.) 
 Janitor: Still remember nationals like they were yesterday. 
 Announcer: Runners, take your positions. On your mark, set... 
 (A g*nsh*t goes off. They begin the race. Janitor easily wins the race. Someone hands him his cigarette.) 
 Janitor: Good race. 
 (End flashback.) 
 Janitor: They offered me a full ride and Grambling, but then I slept with the President's daughter. Not the college president, the President of the United States. But, hey, if Amy Carter asks you out for a nightcap, you do not say no. 
 J.D.: No. No more. Here are some of the lies you've told us over the last five years: You went to Harvard. You have a wife who only has a pointer and thumb-pinky. You have a--a brother-dad, a mother-sister. You have two kids, no wait, you have one kid, no wait, you had a baby with a Chinese local, you're a deaf-mute, oh wait, now you're telling us that you're a world class hurdler and you slept with the beautiful and irreplaceable Amy Carter? 
 Janitor: I--I didn't sleep with Amy Carter. We did everything but. 
 J.D.: Ohh... 
 Janitor: And I really was a world-class hurdler. 
 J.D.: We're not buying it, are we g*ng? 
 Everyone: No, nah, heck no... 
 (Everyone departs.) 
 J.D.: The people have spoken. Allow me to bask in the glow. 
 (Turk enters, excited.) 
 Turk: Oh-ho! J.D., guess what? 
 J.D.: Not now, Turk, I'm glow-basking. 
 Turk: Dude, listen to me!! 
 (Cut to ICU. Turk enters with J.D. riding piggyback, making a lot of noise.) 
 Turk: Where is Carla? 
 Dr. Cox: She just went downstairs. What is all the excitement? 
 J.D.: You tell him. Aw, just wait a mi--OK, you tell him. 
 Turk: We're having a baby. 
 Dr. Cox: Red states be damned, I'm sure you're going to make great fathers. 
 (Elliot enters.) 
 Elliot: What's going on? 
 J.D.: Why don't I tell-- 
 Turk: OK, you go-- 
 J.D.: Uh, Carla, preggo! 
 Elliot: [emotionally] Oh, my God, Turk! Carla must be so happy! 
 Turk: I haven't told her yet. I'm gonna go tell her now. 
 J.D.: Wait, Turk! When has a man ever been able to tell his wife that she's pregnant? Allow me to paint you a picture with my imagination brush, OK? You two come out in the parking lot where all Carla's friends have gathered. They're holding a giant banner that says ""Carla, you're pregnant, and I dove you."" Did I say ""dove?"" I did, Turk. That's when I cue the bird-wrangler who releases 500 white doves into the air. Where do they land? I don't know. But one thing Carla knows is that in her uterus is a little, soft, baby Turk. 
 Turk: Are you forgetting what happened when you made me have doves at my parents' anniversary party? 
 J.D.: This won't be indoors, Turk, and there certainly won't be all those people throwing bird seed. Why were people throwing seed? It's a--the point is that you, my friend, have a chance to be on the greatest surprise a husband has ever pulled for his wife. And you get credit for it the length of your entire marriage. 
 Turk: I'm in! 
 J.D.: Great, I'll tell everybody. You find Carla. Dr. Cox-- 
 Dr. Cox: Halt! I will be doing nothing. 
 Elliot: Well, you at least won't tell Carla, right? 
 Dr. Cox: Ever since I was blitzkrieg'd this morning by an enraged German named Otto, a certain Dr. Barbie no longer exists for me. So, if she was to ask me a question, I wouldn't be able to hear it, and you'd have to repeat it. 
 J.D.: Can you just please not tell Carla? 
 Dr. Cox: Fine. 
 J.D.: And Elliot, if you see Carla, don't get emotional. 
 Elliot: Oh, no problem. 
 J.D.: Really? Baby. 
 Elliot: [emotionally] Oh, my God, Turk, Carla's gonna be so happy! 
 (Cut to Nurses' Station.) 
 Turk: The family wants me to do hip surgery, what are they thinking? The guy is 92! 
 Carla: He's their grandfather. It's not like they can go to a kennel and they can pick out another one. 
 (Cut to J.D.'s fantasy. A grandfather kennel full of old men.) 
 Woman: We just got a lot of great new grandfathers in. 
 J.D.: OK. Oooh, look at this one, he's so cute! 
 Old man: Hey! Get out of my yard! 
 Woman: He's not good with people. 
 (Cut to another cage with an old couple inside.) 
 Woman: He's great, but we don't want to separate them. 
 J.D.: I already have a grandma. 
 (Cut to another cage. J.D. is in a rocking chair with an old man on his lap.) 
 J.D.: If I get one this little, everyone's gonna think I'm gay. 
 (Cut to another cage. An old man is hiding behind a chair.) 
 J.D.: Aw, look at this fellow. Come here boy, I got a little hard candy for you. 
 (The old man comes out and takes the candy. J.D. reaches in and scratches him behind the ear.) 
 J.D.: Yes, you're a good boy. You got a candy you can unwrap in a movie theater! 
 (End fantasy.) 
 J.D.: I'd name him Sebastian. 
 Carla: Hey, what's up with the Janitor? He seems a little more lurky than usual. 
 (Pan to Janitor, his head behind an open panel.) 
 J.D.: Yeah, I pissed him off earlier today. How am I supposed to avoid him? 
 Turk: You should put the hide and seek sensor on him. That way you'll always know where he is. 
 J.D.: It would take a very clever plan to hide this tiny, penny-like sensor on him. 
 (Cut to a hallway. Turk has the sensor and a five dollar bill in his hand as Janitor walks by.) 
 Turk: Five bucks if you eat this penny? 
 Janitor: Done. And done. 
 (Janitor eats the sensor and snatches the money from Turk.) 
 Turk: We pulled it off. See if it works. 
 (J.D. Comes out from behind the desk with the tracker. The beeps get farther apart as Janitor walks away from them.) 
 J.D.: Mr friend, we have just Lo-Jacked the Janitor. Hello. 
 (Cut to ICU.) 
 Elliot: Dr. Cox, I've got a patient with osteo-myelitis who needs a bone biopsy. Who do you use? 
 Dr. Cox: You've put me in an awkward spot, because I'm a healer and I want to help, but speaking to you would acknowledge your existence, and you don't exist. So, I'm going to address the stapler. Hi, stapler, the red is k*ller. By the way, there's a certain Dr. Brownsfield who is just the most wonderful bone guy... 
 (Elliot mouths ""Thank you"" and turns to leave.) 
 Dr. Cox: ...what's that? What's that, stapler? Oh no, she's an actual doctor. 
 Elliot: Neither of you are very funny! 
 Carla: Elliot, here are you lab results. 
 Elliot: [emotionally] Oh, my God, Carla... 
 Carla: Elliot, honey, what's wrong? 
 (Turk gives Elliot a ""cut it out"" signal behind Carla.) 
 Turk: Yeah, Elliot, honey, what's wrong? 
 Elliot: [emotionally] Nothing, I'm just very emotional, because, um, Keith dumped me. I have to go. 
 (Elliot and Turk exit.) 
 Carla: Another one. sh**t. 
 (Carla exits. Dr. Cox walks across the room and fetches Keith in fast motion.) 
 Dr. Cox: Keith, I, uh, I've been watching you and you've got some potential. You do, but can I give you one piece of advice? 
 Keith: Please. 
 Dr. Cox: It is all about confidence. Hell, be a cocky bastard. Throw 'em a wink every once in a while. Show me a wink. Show me the wink. Give a me a wink. 
 (Keith practices winking. Dr. Cox runs to another room and fetches Carla in fast motion.) 
 Dr. Cox: That's the guy. That's the guy who broke our friend's heart. 
 Carla: Well, hey, he's probably hurting, too. 
 Dr. Cox: Mmm? 
 (Keith winks at them.) 
 Keith: Hey, baby! 
 Carla: Oh no, he did not just wink at me. For the next five minutes, I am not a nurse. 
 (She takes off her stethoscope and name badge and shoves them at Dr. Cox, who stops her.) 
 Dr. Cox: Uh, no, Carla. There is a better way. I don't like it, but Jordan tells her friends intimate details about me. Our sex lives, my parenting deficiencies, the point is, I'm sure Elliot has told you things about Keith. So instead of yelling at him, why not calmly let him know that you know things that he thinks no-one knows. 
 (Carla grins.) 
 Carla: Oh, Keith, mind taking a walk with me? 
 Keith: Yeah. 
 (Carla and Keith exit. Elliot enters.) 
 Elliot: Is Carla gone? 
 Dr. Cox: Yeah, she sure is. Say, Barbie. 
 Elliot: Hmm. 
 Dr. Cox: We're even. 
 (Dr. Cox exits.) 
 Elliot: Oh no. 
 (Cut to hospital parking lot. Many people are assembled with balloons and signs.) 
 J.D.: All right everybody, before Carla arrives I want to thank you all for turning out, especially you, Father Rosenberg. Incidentally, when all this is over, I'd love to get the back story on that name of yours, OK? 
 (J.D.'s tracker starts beeping.) 
 J.D.: Excuse me. 
 (J.D. ducks down as Janitor comes outside, looks around and then returns inside.) 
 J.D.: OK, coming through. OK, now apparently they don't have fetus balloons. Who knew? So what I've done is attach string to the belly buttons of these baby balloons to signify the umbilical cord. OK, make sure everybody gets one. 
 Elliot: Keith, you seem to have missed the point here. We're not really broken up. 
 Keith: I just can't believe you told Carla that I made out with my sister in the sixth grade. 
 Elliot: Yeah, I don't understand why you're so embarrassed about that. I've met Denise. She's gorgeous. 
 (Cut to hallway.) 
 Turk: We're just going to have to face that fact that you might not get pregnant for a very, very, very long time. 
 Carla: I know it's going to happen, Turk. And you know what I'm looking forward to the most? 
 Turk: What's that? 
 Carla: When we can go around to our friends and tell them one by one I'm pregnant. I can't wait to see the look of surprise on each one of their faces. I think about it every day. Anyone who tries to take those moments away from me, I'll k*ll them. 
 Turk: Me too. Just need to send a quick text. 
 (Cut to parking lot. J.D. is reading his phone.) 
 J.D.: Oh no. We got a glitch. Abort the plan! Abort the surprise! Abort the babies! 
 (J.D. pops the baby balloon Father Rosenberg is holding.) 
 J.D.: EVERYBODY RUN! 
 (Cut to hallway. Turk and Carla exit to the parking lot, which is now deserted. Pan to the bushes.) 
 J.D.: [whispering] Sorry about the whole ""abort the babies"" thing. 
 Father Rosenberg: [whispering] Actually, I'm pro-choice. 
 Turk's and Carla's apartment. Turk and J.D. are in the living room. Carla brings wine for the three of them.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: Knowing someone's pregnant when they don't know it themselves can get a bit complicated. 
 Turk: You know what, let me take that from you. Um, you left the fridge open. 
 (Carla looks and Turk dumps her wine out on the floor.) 
 Turk: Aw, I spilled it. 
 Carla: I'll get another one. 
 Turk: Sorry. 
 (Carla goes into the kitchen. J.D. grabs a plug.) 
 Turk: What are you doing? 
 J.D.: I may have gotten over-excited and told one or two of her family members that she's pregnant. 
 (Carla presses the play button on the answering machine.) 
 Answering Machine: You have 59 messages. 
 Relative: Carla... 
 (J.D. unplugs the machine.) 
 Carla: Turk, I think the answering machine is broken. And I don't think we have any more wine. Can I have some of yours? 
 J.D.'s Narration: I felt like Turk was starting to blame me for all of this. 
 (Turk throws his wine in J.D.'s face.) 
 Turk: I spilled mine, too, honey. You know what you should do? Ask for some of J.D.'s. 
 (J.D. spills his wine on his pants.) 
 J.D.: Spilled mine, too. 
 Carla: I'm going to bed. 
 (Carla exits to the bedroom.) 
 J.D.: What are you going to do? 
 Turk: I'm gonna go tell her the truth and hope that she's so tired from being pregnant that she doesn't have the strength to kick my ass for more than a few hours. 
 J.D.: Wait, Turk! I have an idea. 
 Turk: You have another idea, huh? I gotta tell you, I'm done with your ideas. And not just for now, but forever. OK, are we clear on that? 
 J.D.: It's a good 'un. 
 Turk: I'm listening. 
 (Cut to cafeteria.) 
 J.D.: OK, we need Carla to find out she's pregnant on her own and we need your help. Can we count on you? 
 Dr. Cox: Absolutely not. 
 Elliot: No way in hell. 
 Dr. Kelso: Who's pregnant? 
 J.D.: If we go down, we're taking you with us. 
 Dr. Cox: What? 
 Elliot: Why? 
 Dr. Kelso: Would someone please tell me who's pregnant? 
 Turk: Carla. 
 Dr. Kelso: Another kid? My God, how many does that make? 
 Turk: This is her first one. 
 Dr. Kelso: If you say so, son. 
 Elliot: You can't blackmail us. 
 J.D.: Really? Because I think you're both very close to Carla, aren't you? And yet you chose not to tell her she was pregnant. Turk how would that go down for them? 
 Turk: Unpleasantly. 
 J.D.: Unpleasantly. 
 Dr. Kelso: Ha. Got you two by the short ones. 
 Turk: Dr. Kelso, it's true you didn't know anything, but I'm willing to bet that these guys would swear on their life that you did. 
 Dr. Cox: [in unison] Definitely. 
 Elliot: [in unison] On my life. 
 J.D.: [in unison] And I'd enjoy it. 
 Dr. Kelso: Well played, Turkleton. 
 Turk: Thank you. 
 J.D.: OK, listen up. Everyone in the hospital knows Carla's pregnant, but they don't know that she doesn't know. We need her to find out on her own before anyone congratulates her, OK? Here's the plan. The three of us are going to run interference. Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, I need you to get her to take another pregnancy test. This plan is foolproof. 
 Dr. Cox: That's impossible. You two are involved. 
 Turk: Heh, we'll see about that. 
 (Turk and J.D. move to exit, but bump into each other.) 
 J.D.: You go left. 
 Turk: OK. That was right. 
 J.D.: Actually, I need to come with you. 
 (Cut to Nurses' Station. Laverne enters with a fruit basket and card that says ""You're pregnant"".) 
 Laverne: Where's Carla? 
 J.D.: Uh, she went up to the roof to get some air. 
 Laverne: Oh. 
 (Laverne exits.) 
 J.D.: Follow her. Lock her up there. 
 Elliot: You got it. 
 (J.D.'s tracker starts beeping.) 
 J.D.: Hello, Janitor, waiting around the corner to grab me. 
 (Janitor comes out from behind a corner with a large cloth sack.) 
 Janitor: How'd you know that was me? 
 J.D.: I'm holding a GPS warning device that goes off whenever you come within a hundred meters of me. It's responding to a tiny sensor in your stomach. 
 Janitor: I knew that wasn't a penny. 
 J.D.: You'll never get anywhere near me. 
 Janitor: We'll see. 
 J.D.: Yeah, we will see. 
 Janitor: Oh, we're gonna see. 
 J.D.: The only thing left to do? See. 
 Janitor: You're going to pay. 
 J.D.: We'll see. 
 Janitor: No time. 
 J.D.: OK, bye. 
 (Cut to ICU.) 
 Turk: Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso, look who I found. 
 Dr. Cox: Hey, Carla, you're glowing. 
 Carla: Really? 
 Dr. Kelso: Nurse Espinosa, have your breasts gotten bigger? 
 Carla: Whoa, Dr. Kelso, that is inappropriate. 
 Turk: Baby, that sounds like a compliment to me. Maybe you're just a little hormonal. 
 (Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso walk away.) 
 Dr. Cox: Well done, Bob, a little direct, but I think we've definitely put the idea of pregnancy in her head. 
 Dr. Kelso: Oh, is that what we were doing? I was just making conversation. 
 (Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso exit.) 
 Carla: I have been a little moody. 
 Turk: Yes, you have, baby. 
 Carla: Plus, this morning I was nauseous, but I thought it was just the pizza rolls I had for breakfast. Yes, I like them, we can get them from now on. Still, Turk, do you think that I should go home and take another pregnancy test? 
 Turk: It's your call, baby. 
 (Cut to parking lot. Laverne is on the roof.) 
 Laverne: Hey!! Somebody get me down from here! 
 Carla: What's she yelling about? 
 J.D.: I don't know, I'll have someone from the psych ward check her out. 
 (Turk and Carla drive away. An intern enters.) 
 Intern: Hey. Dr. Dorian, I got those batteries you asked for. 
 J.D.'s Narration: I was a little anxious because it was tie to change Mr. Beeper's batteries. All clear to the left, all clear to the right. You can do this. 
 (Camera changes to a pair of binoculars looking at J.D. Janitor is watching him from behind a bush.) 
 Janitor: He's 100 meters away, and it's going to take him at least ten seconds to change those batteries. That's not even a world record pace. Ready, set, go. 
 (Janitor takes off running. A stopwatch appears on the screen as the camera changes back and forth between Janitor hurdling obstacles in the parking lot and J.D. attempting to change the batteries. Janitor body slams J.D. and sends him flying.) 
 Janitor: Time! 
 (The clock stops at 9.98) 
 Janitor: Still got it. 
 J.D.'s Narration: As I lay there, watching Nurse Roberts hammer-throw 23 pounds of high end fruit my way, I could take solace in one thing. 
 (Laverne hurls the basket of fruit off the roof which lands on J.D. Cut to Turk's and Carla's apartment.) 
 Carla: [excited] We're having a baby!! 
 (Turk and Carla hug. Cut to the bar - exterior.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: Any second now, Carla and Turk were coming to tell me they were pregnant. Carla had to believe that I was truly surprised. 
 (Carla and Turk enter.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: I was the lynch pin of our plan. Showtime. 
 Carla: Hey, J.D. We have such big news! 
 J.D.: What's the scoop? I would have no clue what it could be. 
 Carla: We're having a baby! 
 J.D.: Oh! 
 (Carla and J.D. hug.) 
 J.D.'s Thoughts: Now give them the ten minute emotional roller coaster ride that is the speech you've been practicing all afternoon. 
 J.D.: Carla, when Turk first told me, I -- 
 Carla: [interrupting] What do you mean ""when Turk first told you?"" 
 J.D.: Oh boy. 
 Turk: Uh...We've known for a day. That pregnancy test you took yesterday was positive. Yeah, I wanted to have everybody at the hospital gather outside and surprise you with balloons and stuff. 
 J.D.: What would you have thought of doves? 
 Turk: J.D., not now. I just wanted to do something really memorable, you know? And I messed that up. 
 Carla: So everybody already knows? 
 (Turk nods.) 
 J.D.'s Narration: Then I witnessed one of those moments that let me know in my heart that these two would be together forever. 
 Carla: Who cares? We're having a baby. We're having a baby! 
 J.D.: Yeah, we are. 
 Carla: A baby! A little you. 
 Turk: Yeah, but a lot of you. 
 (Turk and Carla kiss. Cut to interior. Everyone is there. Carla, Turk and J.D. enter and everyone turns to look. Elliot slaps Keith upon seeing Carla.) 
 Carla: It's OK. I already know. I'm pregnant. 
 ( Montage: Everyone cheers. Carla hugs Elliot. Todd high-fives Turk. Carla hugs Laverne. Keith offers a handshake to Carla, who shoves his hand away and hugs him. Carla hugs Dr. Cox. Carla kisses J.D. and hugs him. Carla hugs Jordan. Everybody celebrates.)","['nd a quick text. \n (Cut to parking lot. J.D. is reading his phone.) \n J.D.: Oh no. We got a glitch. Abort the plan!

scrubs_6_2,285403,6,2,"You're a fatty fatty fatty... 
 What's your son doing? 
 Apparently, he's doing the ""fatty"" dance. 
 Inappropriate? 
 Well, maybe, but I'm raising my son to be a straight sh**t. 
 That's his mom right over there. Oh, thanks for including me. 
 J.D.: Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. 
 My brand-new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do. 
 Should we keep it or get rid of it? I don't know. 
 If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster. 
 Okay, enough pizza talk. I mean, we're clearly stalling here. 
 You're right. So let's go. Do you like kids? 
 Of course I do. What about you? Any nieces or nephews? 
 Yeah, I have a nephew, although he's 45. 
 But occasionally, I do have to change his diaper. 
 He was kicked by a horse. Oh, no. 
 Yeah. Now, how do you feel about adoption? 
 So, beautiful, I hope you keep some ice in this locket 
 'cause you're making me hot all over. 
 Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. 
 Do you want to see it? What? Oh, sure. 
 I'll take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning, huh? 
 Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption. 
 You think if it's a girl you'd doink her? I know I will. 
 Yup. All right. Well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? 
 I mean, plenty of time... I'm totally fine with stalling. 
 Great, because if I hear the word ""baby"" one more time, I'm gonna lose it! 
 Dude, Carla's in labor! Meet me at the apartment! 
 Go, go, go! 
 Is he coming? Is he coming? Turk, she's barely in labor. 
 Oh, he's not talking about the baby. 
 He's here, and now we can have our baby! 
 Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub. 
 Suitcase. Check. 
 Stylish big daddy hat. Check. 
 Big-time collegiate drum line. Check. 
 I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby! 
 Maybe we should just take your car. 
 Okay, ladies, we're here. Calm down. 
 What the hell took you so long? Oh, my God. Did you stop for food? 
 We had to, honey. J.D. Promised the band that we'd feed them. 
 Yeah, let me get 23 cheeseburgers, 23 milkshakes... 
 Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries. 
 Twenty-three... You know what? Twenty-two fries. 
 Twenty-two fries. You didn't think I'd do it, did you? 
 Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way. 
 Yay, congratulations, whoopee. All right, see you. 
 We are so happy for you. 
 He's so sweet. 
 You put one of those inside me. What are we going to do? 
 Turk, you brought my suitcase, right? 
 Of course I have your suitcase, honey. 
 What are you doing? 
 Sometimes, when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra, extra hard. 
 You wanna help me out? Fo' shizzle. 
 Please, Lord... 
 Nothing. 
 Baby, changed my mind. 
 I don't have your suitcase. Turk, what the hell? 
 It's okay, it's okay, Carla, because I packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in and I got you an orderly to take you to your room. 
 Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace. 
 Yeah, I think you're looking for me. 
 Move it along before I eat you! Chop-chop! 
 Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken. 
 Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice. 
 Pretend... You know, pretend it's gin. What's gin? 
 Gin is an alcoholic beverage, which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life. 
 First the fat lady, now this? 
 He's three, Perry. Do you have to be so blunt with him? 
 I'm not gonna BS my own kid. What's the big deal? 
 Hiya, sport! 
 Your skin is wrinkly. Yeah? 
 Well, that shirt you're wearing is gay. 
 Hey, baby, I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you. 
 I spent all weekend talking to my cousin, who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd. 
 That's a black nerd. 
 Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam. 
 Turk, that's so sweet. You know, I do what I do. 
 All we gotta do is wait for the cameraman to get here. 
 ""Cameraman""? 
 No man's gonna be filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual. 
 Hello! Oh, hey, Ted. Cool. 
 All right, I'm gonna go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off. 
 All right, Carla, let's check how dilated you are. 
 Looking real good, Carla. Okay, we're live in three, two, one... 
 Okay, looks like you're at about three centimeters. 
 Greatest show ever. 
 And record. 
 Cool, Swamp Thing. 
 What's that, Daddy? 
 Oh, that's the vag*na of a 35-year-old Latina woman. 
 Baby? 
 What the... 
 J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable. 
 There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mentioned yet. 
 The ""A"" word. I know. 
 Abortion. Appletinis. 
 What? 
 I thought that we could discuss abortion over Appletinis. 
 Did somebody just say ""abortion""? 
 Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business or Jesus'. 
 I believe he would beg to differ. 
 She's right, J.D. Every life is precious. 
 But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us? 
 Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple. No abortions, okay? 
 But what if... No abortions. 
 Let me finish. 
 What if the parents were, like, abusive drug-addicts who would neglect their kid? 
 Oh, well, in that case, it'd be okay. 
 Really? No abortions! 
 How are you not getting this? 
 This sucks. 
 I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get, and even then all I did was open up an Us Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity. 
 Kirsten Dunst? Owen Wilson. Yeah. 
 You know what's making this so hard? 
 This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term. 
 You know what might give us an inkling? 
 We haven't technically had sex yet. 
 That might help us find out if we're on the same page, you know, in the boudoir. Are you hitting on me? 
 I'm sorry. I'm being an idiot, aren't I? No. Clothes off, we're doing it. 
 Yeah! 
 All right, we are definitely sexually compatible. 
 I'm putting that down in the pro ""let's have a baby"" category. 
 That's exactly what we should do. 
 We should make a list of pros and cons. 
 What did you two just do? 
 Because I sure don't see any wedding rings! 
 Laverne, is this your Jesus? 
 Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here. 
 Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you. 
 Great vag*na. 
 So helpful! Don't take it out on The Todd. 
 He was just giving me a compliment. 
 Thank you, Todd. Hey, happy to say it. 
 So, what's next, Turk? 
 Because so far I'm half-deaf from a drum line, I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen Ms. Priscilla. 
 I named her after my high school art teacher. 
 Oh, my God, so did I! 
 Mr. Hebler. 
 (IMITATING MAN'S VOICE) ""It's nice to meet you."" 
 Okay, let me just read the last of the cons. 
 We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is $400,000. 
 Okay. Here are the final pros. 
 Kids are great, we both make good money, your boobs will get huge, I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great... 
 Which you already said. ...tax deductions. 
 Oh, yeah, awesome. Oh, nice one. 
 All right, so then what's the final tally? Nice. Let's see. 
 That's 20 cons and 19 pros. 
 I guess we gotta abort. Yup. 
 Wait, I'm sorry. That's an eyelash, I made a wish. 
 It's a tie. Abortion's off. Okay. 
 So now what? 
 J.D.: Every couple has its share of problems. 
 Congrats, Perry. My son just asked me if my vag*na had ever been on television. 
 And did you tell him not since the late '80s when you were trying to make it as an ""actress""? 
 Whether it's someone digging in... 
 Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy? 
 Jordan, I'm not going to change who I am, all right? 
 End of story. Jackie. 
 (WHISTLING) 
 Or someone's stealing your thunder... 
 Okay, candles are all lit, lavender-scented, your favorite. 
 And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you. 
 And then I got this kit in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it as a key chain. I practiced at home on some calamari. 
 Elliot, you're amazing. 
 Well, is there anything I can do to help? 
 Elliot's got everything covered. 
 Still, nothing's worse than facing the biggest decision of your life and not getting anywhere. 
 Don't you wish it was this easy? Heads yes, tails no. 
 You don't see that every day. 
 You know what? We're getting nowhere. 
 Let's split up for an hour and do some soul-searching. 
 Where are you going? I was just gonna walk around. 
 Why, where do you go when you soul-search? 
 All right, Justin, what should my specialty be? 
 Oncology or radiology? 
 I go someplace wonderful. 
 Anyway, I was thinking we need new table linens for the dining room. 
 Well, not so much table linens as place mats. 
 What do you think's prettier, burgundy or mauve? 
 What the hell's with her? She's mad, but she can't give me the silent treatment because she knows I'd actually love that. 
 So she's giving me talk-until-I-want-to- commit-su1c1de treatment. 
 Sucks to be you. You have no idea. 
 What else do I need for that? Oh, I need new pillow shams and I like cotton, but I think we should get a cotton blend because that's easier to clean and I hate ironing. 
 Maybe we need a new housekeeper. 
 Maybe the housekeeper should come every single day now. 
 Look, Elliot, I'm really trying to be involved in the birth of my child, but you just keep boxing me out. 
 That is not true. Now, out of my way, I've gotta order the birth announcements, put in the car seat and find a yard to bury the placenta... 
 Oh, my God, I'm a monster. Turk, I am so sorry. 
 I just love babies so much. It's true. 
 Sometimes she makes me wear a diaper. 
 Keith, private! 
 So, what is Elliot's plan? Oh, it's really simple. 
 See, when Carla says, ""I'm thirsty,"" 
 Elliot'll say, ""Oh, no, I forgot the ice chips."" 
 That's when I walk in, ice in hand, and I say, ""Christopher Turk, at your cervix."" 
 Should I have a baby, too? 
 You know, I'm a little preoccupied right now. 
 Why don't you ask your unicorn? This is way over Justin's head. 
 He's never even been in love. Not real love, anyway. 
 What's up with the ice? 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I mean, having a baby can completely ruin your life, you know? 
 Not to mention, as a urologist, I have seen what childbirth can do to you down there. 
 I mean, I examined this one woman last month and it was like, (IMITATING ECHO) ""Hello, hello, hello..."" 
 Not a good time, Kim. 
 Oh, God, I'm thirsty. Really? 
 Unfortunately, I forgot the ice chips. 
 Ice chips! 
 Dude, help. I'm totally stuck. Why don't you just yank it out? 
 I would not do that. 
 BOTH: That's how it happened! 
 Ice chips, ice chips, ice-ice chips-chips! 
 Hey, guys. 
 Carla, let me just see how far you can reach here. 
 Okay, perfect. 
 Turk would like you to call him because he's stuck in an ice machine. 
 What? 
 See, that's why I took the precaution. 
 Kim, would you be a sweetie and give Turk a call for me? 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 Hey, baby, look, I... Yeah, he's right here. 
 Hold on. She won't talk to me. Hi. 
 Yes, I know, he missed your wedding, too. 
 All right, hold on. 
 That was from her, not me. Go. 
 Relax, I'll have him out in one second. 
 All right, now hold still. Nobody likes a jagged stump. 
 No! 
 He's being unreasonable. Okay. 
 That was from me. 
 Hey, there. Hey. 
 So, have you decided what you want to do? 
 You know what? Neither one of us should have to go first. 
 How about, on the count of three, we both say what we think we should do? 
 Okay. One, two, three... 
 I got nothing. Appletinis. 
 So, you guys gonna keep it? 
 There's a lot to... Maybe, but if we do, we can... 
 Because... Then we can... 
 Probably. BOTH: Maybe not. 
 You know, I had an abortion. 
 All right, Jackie. As promised, let's go find ourselves a little stethoscope so you can hear what your butt sounds like. 
 Daddy, what's an abortion? Enjoy. 
 My mommy had an abortion! 
 My mommy had an abortion! My mommy had an abortion! 
 My mommy had an abortion. How you doing? 
 Okay, Janitor, Carla's starting to push. Tell Turk. 
 Got it. Your baby has a tail. 
 I told her to stay away from the microwave. 
 Elliot, I can't do it! Okay, okay, I want you to imagine that your uterus is like a tube of toothpaste and you're just trying to squeeze out all that minty-fresh gel, but instead of minty-fresh gel inside, there's a little black baby. 
 We have a prolapsed umbilical cord. She needs a C-section, right now. 
 Put Turk on the phone, damn it! It's okay. 
 Baby, listen. I'm not angry that you got stuck. 
 I know you were just trying to be nice because you're a good-hearted, wonderful, thoughtful man, but listen to me. 
 They're giving me a C-section, and I'm really scared and I need you to be here right now. 
 Something about a C-section. Smile. 
 Almost there? Almost there. 
 Baby! I'm here! Turk, I'm scared! 
 Sorry, Dr. Turk, no ice machines. No! 
 I was 19 and working in Nantucket as a waitress and dating this amazing guy named Andy. 
 Curly blond hair and dimples and eyes that were either sky blue, powder blue, I could never figure out which. 
 Anyway, his best friend, Curt, knocked me up. 
 Don't look at me like that. That was the first guy I had ever slept with. Oh, we're not judging you. 
 J.D.: Whore! 
 I think about it from time to time, but it would have been the biggest mistake to have that baby. 
 We've talked, we've made lists, and we've been as logical as we can here, and we've still got nothing. 
 It's not a logical decision. If it's right, you'll feel it in your heart. 
 Yeah, but what if we don't feel anything? 
 Maybe that's your answer. 
 Carla's having a C-section. 
 Jordan, you okay? 
 My mommy had an abortion. She sure did, sweetie. 
 How are my boys? 
 What's going on? 
 They're about to start. Turkleton! 
 If you are trying to get the same $5 million settlement that damn hook-handed security guard got, you're out of luck, stud, 'cause I put a release button right here on top. 
 Well, what are you waiting for, son? Get in there. 
 How you doing, beautiful? Turk, you're here. 
 I'm so hot. 
 Don't sweat it. I got you. 
 Guys, I have an announcement. 
 (DRUM ROLL) 
 Miguel, please! 
 The baby's out, but the cord was wrapped around its neck, so we had to take it to the NICU. 
 They say you never realize your capacity to love until you have a child. It can change who you are. 
 Where do babies come from? 
 Where do babies come from? Well... 
 When a mommy and a daddy love each other very, very much, sometimes they close their eyes and they make a wish. 
 It can fill you with joy. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to Isabella Turk. 
 I'm a daddy! I'm a daddy! 
 It can even give your heart the answer you thought you'd never find.

scrubs_6_10,285403,6,10,"J.D.: My license had been suspended for a month for drunkenly pushing my scooter home. 
 So old Sasha had become a perch for a local bird g*ng. 
 (CAR HONKING) 
 Luckily, I found another way to get around. 
 What's up? 
 Thanks for the ride, Lloyd. This DUI is such a hassle. 
 Been there, bro. Been there. 
 Alcohol? Crack. 
 Hey, by any chance, do you like speed metal? 
 I did not. 
 (HEAVY METAL SONG PLAYING) 
 (LIP-SYNCHING) 
 I know... Here, sweetie. 
 Oh, babe, I didn't want whipped cream. 
 Oh, well, let me fix it for you, babe. 
 And this isn't soy. Sucks to be you. 
 I'll go get your coffee. 
 Do you know how lucky you are to have a husband? 
 I mean, I've got a brand new home, I am totally ready to start my life, but I just don't know if Keith is marriage material. 
 My mom thinks I should test his love by saying I'm knocked up. 
 If he doesn't propose on the spot, I just demand that he gives me $600 for the abortion, dump him, and ease my sadness with a brand-new pair of Jimmy Choos. 
 That's how she got her rad shoe collection in college. 
 Elliot, you can't test love. When I met Turk, it seemed he was more in love with his best friend than with me. 
 Honey, they got that almond biscotti J.D. Loves. 
 I was wondering if I could borrow some money so I could get him some. 
 No, you got him a present yesterday. 
 The point is, you can't force it, okay? Yeah. 
 Here you go, babe. 
 I think we should move in together. Awesome! 
 Oh, babe! Turk, where's my coffee? 
 Turk? 
 (GIGGLING) 
 Turk? 
 Hey, thanks for the biscotti, Obi-Brown. 
 No problem, Luke. 
 And thanks for answering my page. I really want to rent this place, but once I told the landlord about my DUI and how I sometimes pass out when I poo, he said I need someone to co-sign the lease. 
 What's with that? I have no idea. 
 Awesome ceiling fan. 
 What happened, are you okay? It was a totally unavoidable accident. 
 Check out the hand skills. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 That is awesome. 
 Yeah, you want to see awesome? Turn it up. 
 (CRUNCHING) 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (WHOOPING) 
 Turn it off! Turn it off! This thing came off. 
 This thing came off. 
 He was a beautiful black blur. 
 J.D.: There is not a doctor in the world that would disagree with Brian Dancer when he said... 
 Head wounds suck. 
 I mean, I feel better, but I still can't concentrate and my motor skills are shot. Hell, I can't even write. 
 ANNE: Hi, Brian. 
 Oh, my God. It's an angel. 
 That nasty burlesque dancer with syphilis forgot her damn ostrich feathers. 
 We're a little busy in here, Laverne. 
 That was a weird one. 
 Hi, I'm Anne Chase, Brian's physical therapist. 
 (GREETING IN JAPANESE) 
 I'd love to put my ear on her butt to see if I could hear the ocean. 
 Brian, you're doing that thing where you say your thoughts out loud. 
 It's a side-effect of his injury. 
 Oh. 
 It wasn't, but we'd been having fun since we came up with that. 
 All right, Brian, what do you think we should set as a goal? 
 I want to be able to write my name by the end of the month. 
 Yup, the next month was gonna be really difficult for a lot of us. 
 See, this way, I will know if Keith and I have a future in a month. 
 So, anyway, I can't do surgery for a month. 
 Hey, Dr. Kelso, I was wondering, how does one apply for paid disability leave? 
 Nice try, Turkleton, but the medical staff is shorthanded, what with Gloria on bed rest. 
 Gloria's having twins! My lady's having my babies! 
 Damn right. 
 I'm gonna have your babies so hard, baby. 
 So, you're saying I'm going to be a medical attending for a month? 
 Attending? You don't have the training for that. 
 You're going to be a resident again. 
 Good morning, reasons why I drink. 
 You may have noticed that we have a new face in our group. 
 Oh, these glasses, they're not prescription, but I figured I'd wear them so I could fit in with you medical geeks. 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 Cool, a new black resident! 
 Oh, it's just Turk. 
 Hey, Turk! What's happening, J.D.? 
 Hey, hey, hey! What is up with the giant novelty pen? 
 It's an occupational therapy pen. Brian can't hold small objects. 
 I had an ex-girlfriend who had the same problem. 
 Kidding, no she didn't. That's... That's awkward. 
 Son of a bitch, that's hot. 
 Brian, such foul language should never be uttered in front of a lady with such delicate, soft ears. 
 I have another appointment. 
 Right? Man, why don't you just ask her out? 
 Brian, expertly flirting is one thing, but I'm not ready to get back in the game yet. 
 I just got out of a serious relationship, plus I'm a tent-dwelling poop-fainter who can't drive. 
 I have a fiberglass skull. It's always a competition with you. 
 (MOANING) 
 Oh, my God, that was amazing. 
 I know. Were you thinking about me? Totally. Were you thinking about me? 
 I always think about you when I'm in the box, you know that. 
 Oh, babe. 
 Sweetie? This is actually my grandmother's coffee table, so if you could just use coaster from now on. 
 Oh, the coaster argument. 
 You would not believe the stuff I had to put up with when Turk and I first moved in together. 
 Do you know what I caught him doing in bed, even though I was sleeping right next to him? 
 (TURK MOANING) 
 (GASPING) 
 Hot wing? 
 (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) 
 Look, the point is, it's an adjustment. Get ready for some arguing. 
 Not us. He doesn't even mind sleeping in separate rooms. 
 Living with a guy before marriage makes me feel too whorey. 
 You can live in separate states, but if you're doing the nasty before you get married, your ass is gonna burn. 
 Okay, kids, time to put the spotlight on Mr. Cocky-Pants. 
 Name a test, any test, that you would run for lupus. 
 Lupus... 
 Does she live on the second floor? 
 Does she live upstairs from you? 
 I think you have seen her before... 
 Still waiting. 
 Antinuclear antibody test. Anti-something, something test. 
 It really is just super that you're here with us as a reminder that surgeons really are simply ignorant scalpel jocks. 
 Hell, after surgery, if there's the slightest medical issue, you just turf the patient right down to us, the real doctors, so we can pick up your slack. You cut and run, if you will. 
 That's right, it's not just a phrase used by political pundits who wear bow ties. 
 It is also the number one reason that all of you should pray to God, or in your case, Rex, Moko the Samoan Bird King, that you never have to be treated by these flesh-hungry butchers. 
 Jenny, take his glasses as a trophy. 
 I don't understand why you're so devoted to that guy. 
 He's got this strange power. 
 You wait, eventually you'll crave his approval and become just like me. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 TURK: And still, as I thought about Dr. Cox, I knew J.D. was right. 
 See? 
 Hey! Looks like I caught you admiring the old facial hair, huh? 
 Oh, God! Thank you. 
 I just found out that my great, great, great grandfather was mutton chop enthusiast Ambrose Burnsides. 
 I'm bringing back the look to honor his memory. 
 It looks like tiny hamsters died all over your face. 
 That happened once, but no, this is just how I grow facial hair. 
 It starts out patchy, then it gloriously erupts, you'll see. 
 When this fills in, this look's gonna spread like wildfire. 
 Read 'em and weep. 
 What are you doing in here? Hiding from Anne, man. 
 Physical therapy is too hard. I'm getting nowhere. 
 I know you're scared, but you gotta stick with it. 
 That means a lot coming from someone who's scared to ask girls out on dates. 
 You know what, I'll make you a deal. 
 You stick with the physical therapy and I will ask Anne out. 
 Deal? Yeah. 
 J.D.: I wonder what the odds are of Anne saying yes. 
 Never gonna happen, Q-Tip. 
 Kelso just had his car washed. I'm on it. 
 What did I eat last night? 
 Wow, everything's unpacked. Your stuff looks great, by the way. 
 You mean her stuff. She wouldn't let me put up my stuff. 
 (SHUSHING) 
 Everything's awesome, we're great, everything's great. 
 What do you mean we're great? We haven't had box sex in days. 
 Everything was fine until Elliot broke out her unending list of insane rules, like ""Put all open cereal in giant Ziploc bags."" 
 Yeah, I don't see what's insane about not wanting spiders to lay eggs in my Corn Flakes. That's how Carla's mom died. 
 No, it wasn't. You're supposed to be my best friend! 
 Elliot, you gotta cut each other a little bit of slack. 
 You know what, Keith? Carla's right. I mean, if we're gonna try... 
 Oh, my God! 
 How hard is it for you to use a fricking coaster, you fricking fricky-frick? 
 What... Calm down, all right? So I forget once in a while. 
 Oh, ""Once in a while""? 
 ELLIOT: There. 
 (PANTING) 
 J.D.: As I went to ask Anne out and felt the familiar light-headedness I get right before a poo-faint... 
 All better. 
 ... I thought about the deals we sometimes make. 
 Hello. Okay. 
 You know, Dr. Cox, I wouldn't mind all the crap you've been giving me if I was actually doing anything. You haven't asked me for help once. 
 J.D.: Sometimes deals sting. 
 Because you can't. 
 Make a deal there, Gandhi. I will stop mocking you if you just shut up and stay out of our way. 
 And sometimes a deal can ruin everything. 
 Here's the deal, Keith. My house, my rules. 
 Well, I thought this was our place. 
 No, Keith, this is my place. You just rent a room. 
 Still, my deal with Brian was to ask Anne out and he was watching, so I only had one option, ask her a random question I knew she'd say yes to. 
 Was Papa Smurf the leader? Yes. 
 She said yes! We're going out Friday. 
 (HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING) 
 J.D.: (SHOUTING) I felt bad about my lie to Brian! Still, I... 
 (MUSIC STOPS) 
 I felt bad about my lie to Brian. Still, I knew I had to keep it going. 
 (MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Done. 
 Later, babe. 
 Check out the back scratches. 
 Wow. Good first date, I take it. 
 Okay, go. 
 (SCREAMING) 
 (SCREAMS) 
 Let's just say, ""Kitty like to scratchy."" Oh, yeah, she does. 
 Hey, but don't tell her that you know about us, okay? 
 Trying to keep it on the DL. That's how I roll. 
 Oh, yeah, sure. 
 Now, Dr. Cox, there's gotta be something I can do to help. 
 Well, now, Gandhi, since you don't grasp the fact that I think you're incompetent... 
 Ladies and gentlemen, pay attention, please. 
 Presenting, the world's longest shush. 
 (INHALING HEAVILY) 
 (MOANING) 
 (SHUSHING) 
 I'm gonna go ahead and stop. 
 I'm not committing the way I normally do. 
 I'm gonna go away, regroup, maybe see you later. 
 TURK: I knew right then that somehow I'd make Dr. Cox... 
 Seriously, dude, stop doing that. That's my thing. 
 So, since I told Keith he only rents a room, he refuses to come out of it. It doesn't matter, he'll crack. 
 Probably not until after his party next week. 
 A party in his room? 
 Well, I'm off to my family vacation in Bermuda. 
 Every God-awful year Enid's wheelchair rusts in the salt water, Harrison spends my money getting his hair braided by trannies and I fall asleep in the sun. Don't page me. 
 Damned trannies got me in my sleep. That's just wrong. 
 What are you up to, baby? 
 I've been using all my down time to study medicine, so I can prove to Dr. Cox I'm not just another dumb surgeon. 
 But every time I crack open these books, my brain says, ""Who cares about this crap?"" 
 Then I wonder if we have any frozen sugar-free fruit juice pops at home. 
 I'm gonna help you study tonight and for every right answer that you get, I'm gonna give you a bite of frozen fruit juice pop or, if you'd prefer, I can remove an item of clothing. 
 Okay, a major indicator of hypokalemia is? 
 A potassium level under 3.5. Right! And here comes your reward! 
 Yeah, come to daddy! Yeah. 
 Say, baby, what happened to your shirt? 
 Oh, Izzy spit up on me earlier. 
 Well, how come you ain't put a new one on? 
 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) 
 (PEOPLE CLAMORING) 
 To mutton chops! 
 (ALL CHEERING) 
 Actually, these are fake. You all look ridiculous. 
 Now, I did this to make a point, okay? 
 You have to think for yourself, don't be a sheep, follow the fold. 
 I want you to repeat after me, I think for myself. 
 I think for myself. I think for myself. 
 You can't tell me what say. 
 You can't tell me what say. You can't tell me what say. 
 I won't say this. 
 I won't say this. I won't say this. 
 (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) 
 (ALL SPEAKING GIBBERISH) 
 Unbelievable. 
 Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 
 Hello. It's a little noisy, Keith. 
 Hey, everyone, my landlord wants us to keep quiet. 
 (ALL BOOING) 
 Carla? 
 Give me a break. I haven't partied since the baby was born. 
 I told Brian I was taking Anne to the Poconos, now he wants pictures. 
 You have to help me morph the photos I secretly took of her on my camera phone onto the pictures from our fall foliage getaway. 
 Dude, why don't you just ask Anne out? 
 I don't know. 
 That way you don't have to lie to Brian. 
 It's the right thing to do, just like me studying my ass off. 
 Now, if you'll excuse me, watch me drop some knowledge on Dr. Kizz-ox. 
 Good luck. 
 Excuse me, coming through. 
 So, this patient has fever of 103, renal failure and platelets of 25,000. 
 What is the diagnosis and management? 
 Put them down! 
 It's obvious the patient is septic. I'd treat him with an activated protein C. 
 (EXCLAIMING) 
 Dr. Turk, that's just an excellent diagnosis. 
 (EXCLAIMING) 
 However, with his low platelet count, treatment with activated protein C would cause what, class? 
 Brain hemorrhage! Brain hemorrhage! 
 And what would that cause? His death! 
 Sorry, I got so excited. Everyone's yelling things out. 
 Hey, Ron. 
 CARLA: I told you this would happen. 
 I can't take you seriously until you take off the janitor's mutton chops. 
 Why is it that when it comes to relationships, people can't take advice from someone that's already been through it? 
 We're different than you and Turk. You aren't. 
 We're not gonna go through the same things you did. 
 You are. 
 Our love is special. It isn't. 
 How can you say that? Well, she doesn't get it, babe. 
 Oh, babe. 
 (MOANING) 
 (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) 
 I need some new people in my life. 
 Okay, it's now or never. 
 Excuse me, Anne? Hey. 
 My life really hasn't been in the best place lately. 
 I recently broke up with my girlfriend, who I impregnated on the first date. 
 Don't worry, she miscarried, okay. 
 And I haven't even begun to think about asking anyone else out, mostly because I'm concerned that the stress that lovemaking would put on my body might cause me to pass out, much like I do when I defecate. I also live in a tent and just got a DUI. 
 I know that as a physical therapist, you can appreciate someone who's trying to get their life back on track. 
 Will you please let me take you to dinner and show you that I'm really just a nice guy who's fallen on some hard times? 
 No. 
 Well, just no? Do you wanna elaborate on the ""no""? 
 Nope. 
 So, I lied. 
 And when I finally did ask Anne out, she said no. 
 Well, did she elaborate? She did not. 
 J.D.: The thing about failure is how supportive the people close to you can be. 
 Well, hey, man, it's no big deal. 
 At least you got back in the game, right? 
 So, Dr. Cox, the cast comes off tomorrow. 
 Any last-minute sh*ts you want to take at me? 
 You have diabetes and you can't eat cupcakes. 
 Wow! 
 Look, you may never have the same grasp on medicine as we real doctors do, but you're miles ahead of your fellow numb-nut surgeons. 
 We're okay for now, but I still don't know if Keith is marriage material. 
 You guys made it through a month and you still wanna live together. 
 A lot of couples never make it that far. 
 Yeah, but... 
 ALL: I don't feel like I accomplished anything. 
 (TURN PLAYING) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Brian would like to sign his name on the insurance papers. 
 Here you go. All right. 
 Not bad, huh? That's great. 
 J.D.: Brian made us realize how huge our smallest accomplishments really are. 
 Whether it's having a little more knowledge than your colleagues... 
 Todd, our appendectomy patient may be hypertensive. 
 Let the medical wienies deal with it. Wienie-roast five! 
 Dude, don't be such a surgeon. Let's go check her out. 
 ... or easing up on the rules for the sake of your relationship, 
 or finally being ready to get back in the game. 
 Hey, Katie. You wanna grab a drink? Yeah, but not with you. 
 I'm back! 
 So, they let you back on the road, huh? 
 Well, sort of. 
 They hooked up this nifty breathalyzer on my scooter. 
 If there's any trace of alcohol at all on my breath, it won't start for 24 hours. 
 Yeah, that's where you blow. 
 (ENGINE MISFIRING) 
 Well, better start my shift.","[""ng I'm knocked up. \n If he doesn't propose on the spot, I just demand that he gives me $600 for the abortion, dump him, and ease my sadness with a brand-new pair of Jimmy Choos. \n That's how she got her rad s""]",True
