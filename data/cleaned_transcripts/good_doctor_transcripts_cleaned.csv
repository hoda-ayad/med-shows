 Autism... a mental condition characterized by difficulty in communicating and using language and abstract concepts.

 He's not Rain Man. 
 He's high functioning, he's capable of living on his own, capable of managing his own affairs. 
 ""High functioning""? 
 Is that our new hiring standard? 
 If it were, you wouldn't be here. 
 I'm sorry. Is this really necessary? Really?

 You've wanted his job since day one. 
 Everyone in this room knows that. 
 And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital.

 So let's all play nice, shall we? 
 Stop acting like you're stunned that you're standing there. 
 You tried to slip one past us. 
 I vetted him like I would any other candidate.

 I met Shaun Murphy when he was    years old. 
 I was living in Wyoming at the time. 
 He was, and he still is, an extraordinary young man. 
 Yes, he has autism, but he also has savant syndrome...genius-level skills in several areas. 
 He has almost perfect recall. 
 He has spatial intelligence. 
 And he sees things and analyzes things in ways that... that are just remarkable. 
 In ways that we can't even begin to understand. 
 Those are assets. Undeniable assets for any doctor, particularly a surgeon. 
 You've known him since he was   ?

 You said he'd been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma. 
 Evan was diagnosed with the flu eight months ago, 
 but his symptoms were actually a better fit 
 with Epstein-Barr virus,

 which causes osteolytic lesions 
 in the long bones of the upper limbs.

 You don't make life-altering decisions

 We used to let Quinn do whatever she wanted at home.

 The big issue with the bilateral 
 is Quinn will never be able to have biological children. 
 If Quinn's parents think that Quinn's mature enough 
 and strong enough in her beliefs, 
 then they should do it now. 
 It's an elective surgery on a child. 
 There is no medical necessity. 
 Except with a previous su1c1de attempt, 
 she's still at risk. 
 Her situation is different now. 
 She's socially transitioned and living as a girl.

 He, uh... He already tried to make a direct donation 
 a few months ago, 
 but the patient died before the surgery. 
 I contacted him, which wasn't easy, 
 but he still wants to be a donor. 
 That's amazing. 
 Great job. 
 What's the catch? 
 He wants to be a donor, but he's not on the registry? 
 I mean, there's got to be a catch. 
 He, uh... He can't be on the registry 
 because he is in prison. 
 For m*rder. 
 Actually, um, seven murders. 
 ♪ 
 Boris Tirayan was 
 a Russian Mafia enforcer convicted of seven murders. 
 Who now wants to make amends. 
 He tried to be a donor a few months ago, 
 but the patient died before the red tape could be worked out. 
 But now that it has... 
 Are there any laws against an inmate becoming a donor? 
 No, but there is a ton of liability. 
 What if he att*cks someone here? 
 He'll be guarded by state prison guards 
 on a separate level, 
 away from patients and all nonessential staff. 
 Everyone deserves the chance to turn their life around. 
 The guy wants to do something decent, 
 we should let him. 
 I don't think we owe a m*rder*r anything. 
 But maybe he owes us something. He has a debt to society. 
 Which he would repay by donating his inner organs. 
 Isn't it a slippery slope 
 between a guy who wants to make amends 
 and turning our prison system 
 into a superstore for body parts? 
 A slippery slope that saves a child's life. 
 PARK: It'll never happen. 
 He's just trying to get a hospital, 
 where it'll be easier to escape. 
 You have no idea what his motivation is. 
 I know he's a lying sociopath 
 who doesn't care about anyone but himself. 
 He's been a model inmate for nine years, 
 tutors other prisoners in the library... 
 Yeah, because he's trying to get someone to trust him, 
 to give him an inch, and as soon as they do... 
 We got approval. 
 He's gonna stall, make excuses, and when he sees his chance, 
 someone's gonna get hurt. 
 I think it's worth taking that chance.

 [SIGHS] Eric, there's no such thing 
 as a good or bad liver. 
 It's just a... just an organ. 
 CLAIRE: Eric, this is your only choice. 
 If we don't do the transplant, you will die. 
 ERIC: I don't want him to be a part of me, 
 inside me forever, all right? 
 I don't care what you or anybody else says, okay? 
 It's my body, and I don't want it! 
 That's ridiculous. 
 Personality traits aren't transferred in an organ transplant. 
 It's also irrelevant. 
 Children don't consent to surgeries... 
 their parents do. 
 But if he doesn't cooperate with the anti-rejection regimen, 
 we could be wasting a liver that could save someone else's life. 
 PARK: No one's getting saved by Tirayan. 
 I found a Type-A donor. It's not a perfect match, but... 
 His body's already rejected a perfect match. 
 There's no way it can tolerate an incompatible blood type. 
 No, the only way to save Eric 
 is to do the transplant with Tirayan's liver. 
 That is it. 
 We have no other option. 
 Let the O.R. know we're gonna need more restraints. 
 Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta 
 developed an experimental resorbable material. 
 It would allow us to expand her rib cage 
 and create room to fit her heart inside. 
 LIM: An artificial sternum. 
 That would actually grow along with the patient. 
 The surgery isn't reversible. 
 If it doesn't work, 
 we can't just move her heart back to where it was. 
 It would allow her to have a life. 
 She has a life, and she'll be healthy 
 as long as she stays out of crowds, 
 doesn't hug anyone, 
 or do anything where she might fall. 
 I get you're autistic, but I know even you realize 
 when a patient cries and throws her phone against the wall, 
 they're not happy with their current health. 
 There's no reason to make this personal. 
 There is if his medical judgment is biased. 
 I saw she was upset. 
 You saw it, but you didn't 
 understand 
 it. 
 You're very competitive. 
 Are you trying to make Dr. Lim think I'm biased, 
 or are you trying to undermine my confidence? 
 I'm actually trying to help you and the patient. 
 She wants to be able to rub elbows, 
 and you need to learn how to trade elbows. 
 The resorbable plate is experimental and risky. 
 But my medical judgment is that it's worth it. 
 Make sure she agrees and then get her prepped.

 Came into the E.R. this morning complaining of severe neck pain. 
 X-rays show anterolisthesis. 
 A herniated disc...    a little young for that, isn't it? 
 Unless there's a history of spinal trauma. 
 There is. 
 Hunter fractured seven vertebrae in his neck and back 
 in a motorcycle accident    years ago. 
 He's one of my first patients... 
 suffered complete paralysis from the chest down. 
 ...A few months back, just gnawing pain. 
 Ibuprofen usually took the edge off. 
 Every day? 
 Uh, yeah, give or take. 
 It's not that bad. 
 Last night things changed. 
 He couldn't move his neck at all,

 Yes. At this point,

 I wanted to buy a laptop for school

 Hunter's phantom pain is real.

 It's very rare, but after many years 
 with a bruised cord like yours that isn't severed, 
 it can start to function again. 
 So, this mass is causing Hunter's pain? 
 Yes. 
 If the cord is healthy, 
 why aren't I feeling more than pain? 
 The mass is compressing the healthy cord, 
 just letting the pain through. 
 We still have to do 
 some more advanced imaging to map the mass, 
 but I am fairly confident 
 that if we removed it that could change. 
 You may be able to walk again.

 EMMA: I'm fine. 
 She's just being thorough, honey. 
 You've been over my body three times. 
 Early infections often mimic blemishes. 
 It pays to be thorough. 
 Is this sore? 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] 
 Maybe a little. 
 What's wrong? 
 It could be nothing, 
 or it could be a carbuncle, an early sign of infection. 
 Dr. Andrews needs to have a look at this. 
 This varicocele is raising testicular temperature 
 and causing your sperm count to be low. 
 Surgically, I go in, ligate the varicocele 
 and re-check your numbers in a few weeks. 
 It's done under a local, 
 so no anesthesia risks, minimal blood loss. 
 There's a risk of low testosterone and impotence, 
 but recovery time's usually a week at most. 
 So, I could have kids, I just might not be able to make them? 
 As I said, it's low risk. 
 I only mention it because I'm obligated to inform you. 
 Well, you're obligated to inform me because it's a risk. 
 It's an unlikely complication, but, yes, it happens. 
 It's outpatient.

 Look, I see a lot of men with this issue. 
 Sure, they come in because they want kids, 
 but I think what they really want is to reaffirm themselves. 
 And that's a good thing. 
 Thank you. 
 It's a spinal arachnoid meningioma. 
 Have you seen one of these before? 
 MELENDEZ: Much smaller. 
 They usually don't get this big 
 because the pain and weakness 
 brings the patient into the E.R. fast. 
 But in this case, no pain, 
 no E.R. visit until it got this big. 
 And it's wrapped around the spinal cord tightly 
 and fused with the dura. 
 Can we get a fiber-optic laser and take it out in segments? 
 No, I don't think so. 
 It stopped growing and settled in this position. 
 But I do think that we can dissect 
 along the subarachnoid plane 
 down to the largest segment at T 
 and remove it in one piece. 
 That's an extension of the mass. 
 Mm, no. It's the medullary pyramids. 
 No. It's an extension of the mass. 
 The pyramids are more central and the color is wrong. 
 Murphy's right. 
 The extension's tightly adhered to the brainstem. 
 ANDREWS: Who caught it? 
 Jared did. 
 Nice work. 
 Most first-year residents would have missed this. 
 It's very small on the surface, 
 but I can feel the fluctuance under the skin. 
 What do we need to do to fix it? 
 [REMOVES GLOVES] 
 We need to remove all of the implants 
 and some of the healthy underlying tissue as well. 
 Unfortunately, it will cause significant permanent scarring. 
 No, no, no, you... you can't do that. 
 I'll look worse than I did before. 
 I-I don't get it. You removed the bad part from her face, 
 and it's fixed... looks good, no more infection. 
 Let's just do the same with the rest of 'em. 
 It's not that simple. 
 When we removed the infection from Emma's cheek, 
 it was under the pretense it was a localized issue. 
 If we just take out the infection from the new area, 
 it could jump again. 
 I won't do it. 
 When an infection spreads, it often moves very quickly. 
 What Dr. Andrews is saying... 
 I understand what he's saying. 
 I'm    years old. 
 When I went to drop my daughter off at Michigan, 
 we went to that bar on Liberty Street, 
 where we first met. 
 I saw myself sitting there   years ago... 
 young, confident, full of potential. 
 Then you raise a kid 
 and look after your husband, a home. 
 You lose touch with who you were. 
 You... you said it was an infection, right? 
 Like strep throat or something. 
 That's what antibiotics are for. 
 Couldn't we just use that? 
 We could try strong, broad-spectrum antibiotics, 
 but I really don't want to do that. 
 You could become septic. 
 You could die. 
 ♪ 
 It'll work. It has to. 
 The brainstem is complex.

 So, then, you would just leave the cyst in him? 
 SHAUN: Other than the pain, it's not harming Hunter.

 No.

 CLAIRE: 
 It doesn't make any sense. 
 We are the only hospital on the West Coast     that hasn't adopted the ACGME mandate     on a   -hour max shift length. 
 And numerous studies have shown the negative effects     that sleep deprivation has on critical thinking,     which can cause residents to make mistakes     that not only harm patients, but that waste money. 
 You've done your homework. 
 Um, it's something I've been thinking about for a long time. 
 I actually did a paper on it at med school. 
 Well, Dr. Browne, I've also thought about it. 
 In fact, when the new ACGME guidelines were released,     I joined a nationwide study analyzing a flextime schedule. 
 It found that as long as a weekly max of    hours is adhered to,     patient outcomes and resident satisfaction scores are better     than at hospitals with a daily max. 
 So we're just going to have to agree to disagree     about whether my foolish new policies ""make any sense.""     No, I didn't say... 
 And I know I told you to be more assertive.

 It's called diastematomyelia. 
 It's a congenital disorder in which

 Congenital? So he's had it since birth? 
 Why didn't anyone see it? 
 It's rare, and with no obvious symptoms, 
 doctors generally have no reason to look. 
 The problem is, when Finn hit puberty, 
 the split spinal cords rapidly stretched. 
 The two strands got tethered to his spinal canal, 
 which led to the weakness in his leg. 
 As he grows, he's put at risk for paraplegia. 
 And we can go in and untangle it. 
 But anytime you're dealing with the spinal cord, 
 things can get complicated.

 How do you think that made me feel? 
 You liked it? 
 No, Shaun. I loved it. 
 You want to know why? 
 Because a car to a sixteen-year-old kid 
 means independence, 
 which means he can go wherever he wants 
 whenever he wants. 
 And that doesn't change with age, Shaun; 
 in fact, it means even more. 
 When you took my license, that's what you took from me. 
 I don't expect you to understand. 
 So you don't have to pretend. 
 Hey. Is Andrews stalking you?

 I'm sorry. 
 I wasn't really getting my hopes up anyway. 
 My dad taught me that. 
 He'd say, ""You know what, Billy?""

 Yeah. Her vitals have recovered slightly. 
 The CDC is sending a PCR test 
 based off the virus in the Malaysian outbreak. 
 So what's their treatment protocol? 
 Antivirals, steroids, inhaled nitric oxide 
 and anti-TNF receptor antibodies. 
 That's what we did for the two plane patients. 
 And Tyler. 
 We got to Dr. Lim sooner, that should make a difference. 
 How's Dr. Murphy? 
 He's fine. 
 I saw his breakdown on the security feed. 
 Better. He's closing on Santa Pete. 
 Do you have a strategy for dealing with him?

 Perfect.

 You're still here? 
 What did they say? 
 Very kind of you. 
 No wonder you and Shaun get along so well. 
 What did they say? 
 Did the new tests show anything new? 
 They need time to process the CT images, 
 send them off to Dr. Blaize. 
 So you might have been wrong about your cancer coming back? 
 No. 
 No? 
 How can you know you're not wrong 
 if you don't 
 know you're not wrong? 
 This is how they do it. 
 First they tell you there 
 might 
 be something, 
 and then they order new tests to test the previous tests... 
 only to inform you that it was what they suspected all along. 
 Very effective way of breaking bad news. 
 Okay... 
 And if your tumor really is back, what does that mean? 
 It means that I had surgery and let them pump radiation 
 into my brain for nothing. 
 It means that my memory loss is because my brain is dying. 
 It means that I probably have a year, maybe    months. 
 Enough meaning for you? 
 ♪ 
 What are we gonna tell Shaun? 
 Nothing. 
 St. Bonaventure's opened up a room for family and friends. 
 You want to come? 
 We expand the quarantine, we move our marrow donor 
 and 
 our patient into... 
 If the donor has the virus, his marrow will transmit it 
 to your immunocompromised patient. 
 He'll be dead in hours. 
 As he will be without the transplant. 
 We create a sterile pathway from the E.R. 
 into this procedure room using polyethylene sheeting... 
 No, you won't. 
 The only people taking any risks here 
 are my people, the patient, and the donor... 
 And this hospital and everyone in it if you screw anything up. 
 But my larger objection is... it won't work. 
 That procedure room isn't negative pressure, 
 which leaves the virus free to escape to the main vent system. 
 [PENCIL CLATTERS] 
 I'll figure something else... 
 Janitors' closets. 
 They're negative pressure 
 because of the cleansers, sterilizing agents. 
 Don't want those odors and toxins 
 to disperse to patient areas. 
 Here. 
 That closet doesn't have room for two patients. 
 We can do the extraction there, but not the transplant. 
 [PAPER RUSTLES] 
 We could use this linen room, in the basement, 
 which is also negative pressure 
 and connects to the janitors' closet 
 through this laundry chute. 
 Once the bone marrow is extracted, 
 it'd travel through the laundry chute into the linen room. 
 Where you could do the transplant.

 That's not something to worry about. 
 I either have the virus or I don't,

 Oh, we don't need to, Dr. Han. 
 We can make a plug small enough for her heart... a PTFE disc with a stem like a mushroom. 
 Then we can insert the stem through one of the holes until the disc presses against the wall, covering all the holes.

 The higher pressure on the left side of her heart would keep it in place.

 You were on duty when Dr. Murphy passed out, right? 
 I was first one in. 
 Is this where he was standing? 
 I think he was closer to the patient. 
 Hmm... 
 W-What about the blinds? 
 Were they like that? 
 Please, I need to know what Shaun's experience was when he was standing here. 
 Also, could I get a step stool? 
 Sure. 
 Thanks. 
 Why can't you get him his job back? 
 You were the president for, like, a hundred years. 
 I'm gonna fight for him, but I'm only one vote. 
 We all get smacked around. 
 We got to learn to take the hits, lick our wounds, and move on. 
 He likes you, you know? 
 Yeah, I like him, too. 
 He likes you more. 
 When he gets rejected, I'm glad it's coming from somebody who cares about him.

 Hey, Shaun. 
 It's me, Auntie Em. 
 What are you doing in my room? 
 No, Shaun, we're in the hospital. 
 You were pretty bad earlier, 
 - but now you... 
 - Zack... Zack... 
 Zack has the wrong diagnosis. 
 - No, no, no, Shaun. I know. 
 - No, no, he'll... 
 - It's fine. It's actually fine. 
 - He'll die unless he's treated immediately. 
 - Shaun, it's fine. 
 - No, he needs... 
 ""Trampoline."" 
 Zack had an aortic arch aneurysm with signs of impending rupture, the evidence of which was a pulsatile mass in his neck. 
 That and his erratic gait and behavior are explained by the fact that he had tertiary syphilis. 
 Also known as... Treponema. 
 Zack misheard you, but we were able to repair the aneurysm, and he is stable now. 
 GLASSMAN: Okay. 
 Okay. 
 All right. 
 Lie down, Dorothy. 
 Get some rest, all right? 
 We finally got her history. 
 Those doctors who said Junie wouldn't survive the night, they were right. 
 Three days before her  th birthday, Junie died. 
 Ida never had any grandchildren. 
 What about her husband? 
 He did pass away two years ago, but he and Ida separated after their daughter's death.

 Good. 
 I saw a movie last weekend. 
 Which one? Was it good? 
 What kind of movies do you like? 
 Oh. This looks delicious. Thank you. 
 I said no pickles. 
 Pardon me? 
 It's okay. They can just take that off... 
 I said no pickles. 
 Oh. I am so sorry. 
 I said no pickles. 
 It was a disaster. 
 What happened? 
 Don't you all have work to do? 
 Sorry. We were just... 
 Shaun was on a date. 
 Hmm. 
 Congratulations on your promotion. 
 I believe you're our first female Chief of Surgery. 
 That's nice. Uh, thank you. Yes. 
 And you're still not working. 
 Not you. 
 We need to go to H.R. and break up. 
 We need a head CT and a trauma panel. 
 Please! Someone! Help my wife! 
 We've been married for    years. 
 Two children. 
 Eh, so far. 
 Oh, stop it. 
 Ricky and Tammy. 
 Ricky's got two kids of his own. 
 When did you first notice the pain? 
 - This morning. 
 - No, on Saturday. 
 He has a history of kidney stones. 
 I try to get him to drink more water... 
 You ""try""? 
 When did I ever say no to you? 
 It's probably another stone, but we'll do some imaging to rule out anything more serious. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Did you tell them about the kids? 
 We have two, you know. 
 So far. 
 That's nice. 
 - Not it. 
 - What? 
 He's got dementia, and even worse, it's boring. 
 Probably stones. 
 Best case scenario, it's a kidney tumor. 
 We've assisted on eight nephrectomies. 
 It's your case, your chart, you're primary. 
 Kellan's coming to town. 
 I need to be out of here at a decent hour, and we are not children. 
 We do not decide things by who called it. 
 You touched the chart first. It's yours. 
 - Did not. 
 - Did so. 
 We walked up together, Petringa handed the chart to you. 
 - Did not. 
 - Did so. 
 - Did not. 
 - Did so. 
 Why? 
 It just wasn't working out. 
 Oh. Well, I certainly hope it's not because in light of 
 Dr. Lim's recent promotion to Chief of Surgery that she's now your supervisor? 
 We knew that arrangement would be unacceptable, and since we only recently started seeing each other... 
 You were seeing each other secretly for some time before you reported it, correct? 
 So, maybe you've just gone back to seeing each other in secret. 
 No. Uh, we made the decision that this opportunity for Dr. Lim is just... 
 You're... What... What are you writing? 
 I have accepted your explanation and report. 
 Thank you. 
 But I don't believe it. 
 You're going to keep seeing each other, and I can't do anything to stop that, nor do I even want to. 
 But know this... love doesn't conquer all, lust doesn't either, and like doesn't even come close. 
 This is gonna be a lot more complicated than either of you think. 
 Looks like you have a large uterine fibroid that's bled. 
 It has to be removed surgically. 
 Yes, routine surgery. You should be fine. 
 Uterine? Am I gonna be able to have... 
 The surgery won't affect your ability to have children. 
 I didn't let her finish her question because 
 I anticipated what she was going to ask because the uterus has very few functions. 
 - Nicely done. 
 - Yes. 
 To improve O.R. access, we're going to a*t*matic block release and implement staggered starts for anesthesia. 
 Any questions? 
 Dr. Andrews and Dr. Han wouldn't authorize staff overtime. 
 Now, our nurses... 
 Good point. Thank you. 
 Yes. Authorized. 
 One other thing, and this is really for our third years, but it will affect all of you. 
 Traditionally, you don't get to lead surgeries until fourth year. 
 That will be changing. 
 The earlier you get in there and take responsibility, the more chance you have to learn. 
 When the right surgery comes along... something simple, basic, it'll be yours. 
 Start prepping. 
 Maybe I did touch the chart first. 
 Relax. It's okay. 
 I can stay late now and again. 
 This is my job. 
 Stop it. 
 You don't want the case. 
 It's boring. I get it. 
 I know you get it. 
 Boring is now exciting. 
 Boring means it's a routine surgery, which means it's a surgery that Lim just said one of us may well lead. 
 This one's probably no surgery at all. 
 It's probably just kidney stones and late nights with a man with dementia. 
 I'll take that chance. 
 You hate people. 
 People don't know that. 
 People like me. 
 You need to be with your family. 
 Kellan's   . He barely talks to me. 
 It's who touched the chart first, which, as you said, was me. 
 - And as you said... 
 - Excuse me. 
 Y-Yes, Harvey? Is everything okay? 
 Why am I in here? 
 Nothing to worry about. 
 It's likely just a kidney stone. 
 You just have to... 
 Yes! It's cancer. 
 Nicely isolated, simple surgery. 
 Perfect for a resident. 
 Put some traction on the uterus to expose the broad ligament. 
 I'll slide the pelvic retractor under the fundus. 
 Did the wine spill all over you? 
 Um... 
 Did it spill all over Carly? 
 S-Stop. 
 Look above the posterior cul De sac. 
 - Cancer. 
 - Yes. 
 Very extensive, I think. 
 It appears to have metastasized everywhere. 
 Liver, kidney, abdominal wall. 
 Close her up. 
 I rang the doorbell. 
 Yes, you did. 
 Are you gonna spend the rest of your life lying around in this backyard? 
 That, and lying next to my future wife. 
 Congratulations. I heard. 
 But what are you going to do professionally? 
 When people think they're going to die, like you did, they assess their life, reevaluate what's important. 
 You're going to need to make a difference. 
 Do you have a puppy for me to adopt? 
 I have a vacancy at President. 
 Again? 
 You're interested, but you think things have to change. 
 They don't. 
 You led a meaningful life before cancer, and you will lead a meaningful life after. 
 Well, thank you. I'm very inspired. 
 Think about it. 
 Also, sunscreen. 
 What's going on behind the pancreas at the root of the superior mesenteric artery? 
 We need a better angle. 
 We're not gonna get a better angle. 
 Definitely not when we're actually operating. 
 So what's the solution? 
 There isn't one. 
 Not surgically. 
 We should refer them to an oncologist. 
 Chemo might help, but I'm not hopeful. 
 What are you gonna tell them? 
 You guys are third year. 
 You want stuff to learn by doing? 
 How about sympathetic communication? 
 Shaun, let the bride know she's probably dying. 
 This morning, who did you give the Calderon chart to? 
 I gave it to you guys. 
 Uh, but you handed it to one of us. 
 One of us actually took it from you. 
 It was me, right? 
 I don't know. What does it matter? 
 You just came up and... 
 From the right. 
 I came up on Morgan's left. 
 You're left-handed? 
 It only makes sense that I would be closer to... 
 Excuse me. 
 Is there any news about my husband? 
 Harvey, you remember Drs. Park and Reznick. 
 They did your scan. 
 R-Right. For my, uh... 
 They were looking for kidney stones. 
 Unfortunately, we found some cancer. 
 - It's on your left kidney. 
 - Cancer? 
 The good news is it's isolated and in a very operable location. 
 Cancer. 
 I have cancer? 
 We have to tell the children. 
 We'll do a biopsy to confirm, but I'm confident that we caught it early. 
 This is terrible. I... I can't die. 
 I... You need me. 
 I know. 
 But with surgery, radiation, and immunotherapy, the prognosis is excellent. 
 You're supposed to be talking to our patient. 
 They can wait until we're sure. 
 We are sure. Dr. Melendez is sure. 
 Dr. Lim told us we're ready for more responsibility, so I decided I can make a decision on my own, and I decided to do some more research. 
 Shaun, you need to learn how to do this, and stalling just makes it worse. 
 I think maybe you're feeling bad about your date, and you're in here burying yourself in things you subconsciously think you can control. 
 How do people know what's going on in their subconscious? 
 What happened, Shaun... when you jumped up? 
 Your phone is ringing. 
 - It can wait. 
 - Mm. 
 It's your mother. 
 It can wait. 
 What went wrong? What was the disaster? 
 She called earlier, too. 
 If stalling is bad, then why are you avoiding your mother's calls? 
 Did you ever forgive your mother for not protecting you? 
 Is that what your mother wants to know? 
 My mother was a terrible mother. 
 It wasn't all her fault. She was bipolar. 
 That doesn't change the fact that she was terrible. 
 I... I don't think it's good for her to be in my life. 
 Are you looking for guidance... from me? 
 Am I a role model to you? 
 On some issues, absolutely. 
 I don't usually think about the past. 
 It doesn't help. 
 But the date. 
 Mm-mm. 
 Yesterday is part of the past, and the past matters. 
 What happened? 
 I... told a joke. 
 - No. 
 - Yes. 
 Lea said I should. 
 No. That is not what I said. 
 Does this tie look good? 
 Yes. But not with those pants. 
 And what I was saying was that jokes are the types of things people do on dates. 
 They talk about the weather, hobbies, where they went to college. 
 I'm a person. 
 Should I change my pants with you in the room? 
 No. 
 And, yes, I know you're a person, Shaun, but we all have strengths and weaknesses. 
 Telling jokes is easy. 
 There are books full of them. 
 I said no. 
 Yes, there are a lot of jokes, but you have to know how to tell them. 
 You have to know when to tell them. 
 So, I took a gap year before college, which, in hindsight, I think might have been a mistake. 
 Staying at home. 
 My relationship with my dad... 
 Caesar walked into a bar and asked the bartender for a martinus. 
 The bartender said, ""Do you mean a martini?"" 
 And Caesar says, ""If I wanted two, I would have ordered two."" 
 Uh... did she laugh? 
 I'm not sure. 
 Well, what did she say? 
 She made a sound. 
 ""Heh. Heh heh heh."" 
 You got a chuckle, I think. 
 - That's... That's good. 
 - No, it's not. 
 I read six joke books, and all I got was a... ""Heh. Heh, heh, heh."" 
 It was a disaster. 
 Because of a joke? 
 Something bigger must have gone wrong. 
 What happened? 
 A young woman may be dying. 
 I have a lot of research to do. 
 Boom. My chart, my case, my patient, my surgery. 
 You took it from me. 
 It touched my fingers... I know it did... 
 - and then you took it from me. 
 - All I know is 
 I'm the one holding the chart. 
 That's the evidence we got to deal with. 
 If you could prove... 
 Angles. We need more angles. 
 How many cameras do we have in that section? 
 Dr. Lim, I'm glad you made that decision on the overtime. 
 Oh. You're welcome. 
 But I thought you'd want to know the real issue isn't the overtime. 
 It's being understaffed. 
 We need two more nurses on this floor alone, one in ICU... 
 I'm sorry. I'm sure you're right, but we just don't have the budget. 
 Excuse me? 
 Nothing, ma'am. 
 I gave you the OT. You're not being fair. 
 Aren't I? 
 You told me I was right, then you told me you're not gonna do it. 
 Who's being unfair? 
 Nobody said this job... 
 Shaun. 
 Come with me. 
 Is everything okay? 
 The nurse told us you didn't finish the surgery. 
 Suzanne... 
 ...you have very extensive cancer throughout your abdomen. 
 It appears to be malignant. 
 And it appears to have metastasized around every organ. 
 But there's hope with surgery. 
 We can't see the retrohepatic part of the cancer because of the liver. 
 We can't see the retroperitoneal part because of the right kidney. 
 Yes, I know. That's why we should take out the organs. 
 You want to remove her liver and right kidney? 
 Yes. 
 And also her left kidney and her pancreas and her intestinal tract and the stomach. 
 You do know that several of those organs are quite essential. 
 We'll put them back. 
 We remove them, clean up the cancer, then put them back. 
 Ex vivo surgery. 
 It's been done for pancreatic cancer. 
 Without much success. 
 No. 
 You think it'd work better here? 
 Not really. 
 But the alternative is death. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 How are you? 
 Good. 
 N-Not working? 
 Yeah. 
 It's been    hours, and I still haven't found a job. 
 Relax. I'll be fine. 
 I got some irons in the fire. 
 What do you need? 
 How do you say no to a person? 
 I don't think I'm doing it right. 
 Okay. Watch closely. 
 Really? 
 If you're gonna give up that easily, you might as well just quit now. 
 The biopsy confirmed that the kidney cancer is a renal cell carcinoma. 
 Cancer? I have cancer? 
 Yes. 
 Why didn't you tell me? 
 We did. 
 The good news is that it's treatable with surgery and immunotherapy and radiation. 
 We have to tell the children. 
 The children know. 
 How do they know? 
 What's going on? 
 Am I dying? 
 The cancer is serious, but... 
 Ruby, we'd like to talk to you outside. 
 I'll be right back. 
 The problem isn't how you said no. 
 The problem is how you said yes. 
 She seemed quite happy with the yes. 
 It came too quickly. 
 You made her think she was helping you instead of the other way around, so she came asking for more, feeling she was entitled to more. 
 So I should have said no when I wanted to say yes? 
 You shouldn't tell her what you want to tell her. 
 You should tell her what she needs to hear. 
 See, it's your job to figure out what you can give them, convince them that's what they need, and then make them feel like they owe you. 
 N-None of that sounds like me. 
 And you want to do the job your way, without changing who you are? 
 Is that amusing to you? Yes, I do. 
 Yesterday, you were an attending. 
 Today, you're Chief. 
 You are a different person. 
 Want an espresso? 
 Without surgery, your husband would probably live another two to five years. 
 He would have very little discomfort until very close to the end, and that can be managed. 
 - You said it was treatable. 
 - It is. 
 But fighting cancer's never easy. 
 We have to weigh the benefits against the suffering, and the surgery itself is usually the easiest part. 
 He's strong. He's healthy. 
 He's not healthy. Not mentally. 
 And the burden on you... 
 I am not letting my husband die because caring for him is inconvenient, because I'm gonna have to repeat a conversation. 
 Just go to hell. 
 This type of surgery's never been done for this condition. 
 We'd be dealing with every one of your abdominal organs, and something could go wrong with any of them. 
 You could be on dialysis for the rest of your life. 
 You could have a very compromised digestive tract, lifelong diabetes. 
 You could have liver failure. 
 That's not a complete list. 
 You could die. 
 And, um... if we don't do the surgery? 
 Chemotherapy and radiation. 
 Although the likelihood of success is slim, about   %. 
 You may prefer hospice care. 
 You'd probably live maybe a year, but it'd be a good year. 
 Could you give us some time to think about it? 
 Of course. 
 We're supposed to be at lunch. 
 We're gonna be late. 
 Why? 
 Why? Because I need meaning in my life. 
 Your heart seems fine. 
 Your liver... seems to be in the right place. 
 You're a brain surgeon. 
 You don't think you can get meaning being a brain surgeon? 
 This is a boring patient with boring symptoms. 
 Shaun, meet Marco Higgins, diesel mechanic, currently in between jobs. 
 Three sons, two of whom he hasn't spoken to in quite some time, but he's working on that. 
 Open. 
 Wide. 
 It's good to get to know people, Shaun. 
 It makes you a better doctor. 
 Say, ""Ah."" 
 Ah. 
 You have boring symptoms. 
 That's a good thing. 
 You do not want exciting symptoms. 
 You had a date last night, didn't you? 
 Mm. 
 I want to hear about this. 
 Marco, you want to hear about this? 
 Yes, please. 
 Yes, please. Open. 
 It was a disaster. 
 Oh, thank you, Shaun, but it's really not... 
 No, it's polite and chivalrous... 
 ...and even though chivalry is a problematic notion, politeness is a good thing, no matter which... 
 - Ohh! 
 - Shaun! 
 - Are you okay? 
 - Oh, my.

 - She might not be okay. 
 - No, I am okay. 
 - Okay. Don't get up. 
 I'm pretty sure she's okay. 
 Take off his boots. 
 What? 
 Do you think Marco's diabetic? 
 Based on the color of his skin in the crease of his neck, I do. 
 Based on what it says on his chart, I do, too. 
 He could have an infection in his feet, and the pain is being masked by diabetic neuropathy. 
 That infection could be causing the abdominal symptoms. 
 Marco, would you mind taking off your boots? 
 I was wrong. It's not boring. 
 I can do it myself. 
 I'm sure, but our job here is to help each other, and today I didn't do that. 
 I'm trying to make up for that with a jar of pickles. 
 I overstepped and... 
 ...undercut you in front of the patient's wife. 
 I accept your apology. 
 What I should have done was privately tell you that you're wrong. 
 - Give me the jar back. 
 - And let you, as lead doctor, tell them that this surgery's a bad idea. 
 Because we should let a   -year-old man die of a treatable condition? 
 Because we shouldn't condemn a   -year-old man to years of confusion and fear. 
 His life still has value. 
 Seriously? 
 He has memory issues. 
 He's not a vegetable. 
 He's funny, he's charming. 
 They've lived a life together. 
 He brings happiness to his wife, to his children. 
 - He's happy. 
 - Exactly. 
 Let him stay happy for whatever time he has left. 
 Nurse Petringa. 
 I'm sorry if I overstepped. 
 I didn't track you down for an apology. 
 You gonna get us the additional staff? 
 No. 
 If I get you the additional staff, you lose hours, you lose overtime. 
 So you're doing us a favor by making sure we never see our families? 
 Your problem isn't the staff. 
 Your problem is the actual work, the crap part of the work that takes too long and too many of you.

 I'm well aware of what he'll be going through. 
 My sister had cancer. 
 The chemo, the radiation... 
 They beat the crap out of her, didn't they? 
 Yeah. 
 Now imagine going through that and not understanding, every day. 
 Throwing up and not knowing why, losing your hair and not knowing why, learning he has cancer and being devastated by it day after day. 
 But at the end... 
 There are no guarantees. 
 He's old, and his body's breaking down. 
 His mind is breaking down, and it's gonna end, no matter what we do. 
 In    years, I have never once lied to him. 
 When memory goes, all that's left is emotion. 
 What we've learned doesn't matter. 
 What we had for lunch, where we went for vacation, none of it matters. 
 But how we feel... who we're close to... 
 He's the same man I've always loved. 
 Same sense of humor. 
 Same everything. 
 He hasn't changed. 
 And what I owe him hasn't changed. 
 Have you decided? 
 Not yet. 
 Take your time. There is no urgency to... 
 What are you waiting for? 
 Dr. Murphy, they are kind of facing an impossible choice. 
 But they have to make it. 
 What additional information are you waiting for? 
 - Shaun... 
 - I'll be a better doctor if I understand the patient. 
 True, but right now, your skills are secondary to their... 
 Are you debating whether you should find somebody else to fall in love with, someone healthy? 
 No. No, of course not. 
 You should be. 
 We're kids. 
 You shouldn't have to spend the rest of your life taking care of an invalid. 
 You think that's the issue? 
 Me? A-A burden on me? 
 This is so much easier on me than you. 
 No, it's not. 
 Whatever happens to me is gonna happen, and I have to live with it. 
 You... 
 You have a choice.

 Now, if this had happened yesterday... 
 So... it's not that difficult a decision then, right? 
 I guess not. 
 I can feel her humeral head outside the glenoid fossa. 
 It's an anterior dislocation. 
 I can reduce that. 
 Here? 
 Yes, with traction and external rotation. 
 Ow! 
 Oh. Oh. 
 Oh, my, that... that... that feels better. 
 I bumped you. 
 Oh, d-d-don't worry. 
 It happens. I-I wasn't watching, either.

 You bumped into a very understanding woman, you amazingly caught a bottle of wine.

 Unclamp the superior mesenteric to perfuse the organs.

 We'll need to resect all the necrotic segments. 
 Claire, find the first viable part of the ilium and clamp proximal to it. 
 I don't think your irons in the fire are very hot. 
 Any job interviews you get, you're gonna spend a large chunk of time trying to explain why you lasted less than a year as President at St. Bonaventure. 
 I mean, how do you put a positive spin on why you spent a fortune on a Chief of Surgery you fired weeks later to protect a second-year resident? 
 You think I made a mistake? 
 No, I think you did the right thing. 
 I admire you, which is why I want to do you a favor. 
 What you need to do is prove that you haven't burned any bridges, which means you have to come back to work at St. Bonaventure. 
 As what? As a surgeon working for you? 
 And the fact that you're undoubtedly in need of a surgical attending to replace yourself is just a coincidence? 
 It's what you need. 
 I admire the effort. 
 But don't con a con man. 
 Your greatest strength and your greatest weakness as a leader was your stubbornness. 
 Don't let it be a weakness today. 
 My back hurts on the left side. 
 That's where you had your biopsy.

 Anything could happen at any time. 
 Anything did. 
 There was too much to remember to do, too much to remember not to do, and none of it made sense. 
 It was hard, uncomfortable, unpleasant. 
 I spent the whole evening doing unnatural things to make her happy, and I have no idea if she was happy, and I know I wasn't happy.

 The surgery went very well. 
 We're confident that we got all of the cancer. 
 There's a bag by her side. 
 Is that just to drain stuff post-surgery? 
 There were complications. 
 We had to remove a large portion of your bowel and divert the waste through a stoma in your skin. 
 That's an ileostomy bag. 
 How long will I have that? 
 Forever.

 Yes.

 Hey, Shaun? 
 You got a minute? 
 Okay. 
 [SIGHS] Debbie wanted me to talk to you. 
 To tell you... not to give up on love. 
 Don't give up on love. 
 Okay. 
 Do you want me to let her know you told me? 
 Yes, please.

 Hey, Shaun? 
 I know this, uh, dating thing can be scary. 
 You're good at dating. 
 Well, before Debbie, the last time I went on a date, 
 ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" was the big hit. 
 'Cause a-a-after Maddie and the divorce, 
 I kind of shut down for a while. 
 Yeah, I... and it felt better to be in a place where I couldn't get hurt. 
 But then, last year, I got my diagnosis, I thought I was gonna die, and Debbie came into my life, and I said to myself, ""I-I-I don't want to be safe anymore."" 
 You know? 
 I want to... I want to... I want to feel alive. 
 And... And if I get hurt, I get hurt. 
 That's part of the deal.

 Morgan's right. 
 So 
 I'm

 No. No.

 Why should it make any sense? 
 When I think about the reasons I-I'm in love with Debbie, okay, she's... she's kind, she's funny, she's... she's loving. 
 But that's not it. Not really. 
 [CHUCKLES] Don't tell her this, but there are other people in the world that are kinder, that are funnier, that are more loving than she is, but she makes me happy... just being around her.

 I'm Dr. Browne. 
 I'll be performing your surgery today. 
 I'm Dr. Browne. 
 I'll be performing your surgery today. 
 Dr. Browne... 
 I'll be performing your surgery today. 
 It's a very simple procedure. 
 It's a straightforward procedure. 
 It was a successful surgery. 
 The surgery was a success. 
 We expect a full recovery. 
 I expect a full recovery. 
 Baby. 
 Where do you want this? 
 Uh, thanks, Mom. 
 Uh, put it by my bag. 
 I'll have the hospital lab run it. 
 Nausea and severe abdominal pain after eating. 
 This patient could need a lap chole. 
 That would be an ideal first surgery. 
 Let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
 She may just need an antacid. 
 Hi, Michelle. 
 I understand your mother is on her way in. 
 - I'm Dr. Browne. 
 - And I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 You need to fix my sister. 
 What's your name? 
 - Tisha. 
 - Hi, Tisha. 
 Well, that is exactly why we're here... 
 To help your sister. 
 Foster sister. 
 When did the pain start? 
 About an hour ago. 
 It was on the bus. 
 My sister rides with me every day to school and back. 
 My brother and I used to live on a bus. 
 Cool. 
 Have you felt like this before? 
 A few times. 
 Ow. 
 She has extreme upper-right quadrant tenderness. 
 That's consistent with cholecystitis. 
 As is her fever and elevated white count. 
 Your gallbladder probably needs to be removed. 
 You must be excited, Claire. 
 This is going to be your first surgery. 
 Has your urine changed color? 
 Gotten darker? 
 I hear Dr. Browne might have landed her first lap chole. 
 It's not exactly a straightforward case. 
 The duct is massively dilated, the wall's inflamed, this scarring... 
 It's gonna limit visibility. 
 Well, the thickness of the gallbladder wall 
 does pose a challenge. 
 What do you think? 
 It's not her decision. 
 It's mine, as the attending. 
 Doesn't mean she shouldn't offer her opinion. 
 I think that, um, Dr. Melendez is right. 
 With the limited visibility, I shouldn't be... 
 Only with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
 Which I don't think we should do. 
 An open procedure would provide a clearer view of the gallbladder and the surrounding anatomy despite the inflammation. 
 Carly and I went on another date last night. 
 Mm. What did you do? 
 Dinner, movie... 
 We walked    minutes to a deli and had some food and talked. 
 Where are we going? 
 Andrews is starting an open chole. 
 Sounds like it's going well with you and Carly. 
 Oh, yes. 
 She answered all of my questions. 
 How many did you ask? 
 , although some had multiple parts. 
 ""Do you want to have children? 
 If yes, how many and when?"" 
 ""Where do you plan to raise them? 
 In what religious tradition?"" 
 Those are pretty intense. 
 They're good questions, Claire, about important topics. 
 Early on, people usually stick with lighter stuff... 
 Favorite movies, bands, hometowns. 
 Small talk. 
 Put some LAPs in the upper-right quadrant. 
 Here's the Bovie, Dr. Andrews. 
 Isn't the point of dating to gather information to determine compatibility? 
 Retract the omentum. 
 Sure. 
 Isn't that best achieved by finding out what's important to the other person? 
 Hemostats. 
 It's a... It's a process, Shaun, like peeling an onion. 
 People are more comfortable revealing their layers gradually, as opposed to getting sliced right down the middle. 
 I heard Dr. Lim selected you for the first lead. 
 I'm guessing you drew a cholecystectomy. 
 Sponge on a stick. 
 What's your approach to dissecting... 
 Retrograde or antegrade? 
 Antegrade. 
 Once I've located the porta hepatis. 
 I think Carly was comfortable. 
 Why does it matter 
 what kind of questions are asked when? 
 Aren't the answers what's important? 
 - I'm sure you're right. 
 - Yes. 
 What is the plan for the next date? 
 Hmm. 
 We didn't make another date. 
 Then I grasp gallbladder fundus 
 - and elevate it which way? 
 - S-Superiorly. 
 Is that significant? 
 No follow-up date? 
 Not necessarily. 
 How did the night end? 
 Good-night kiss? 
 I've exposed the triangle of Calot and ligated the cystic duct and artery. 
 What is the risk at this juncture? 
 - Lacerating the liver during dissection. 
 - Correct. 
 We didn't kiss. 
 Ironically, a complication which I've inadvertently just demonstrated. 
 Hold direct pressure. 
 I need better exposure. 
 I sliced instead of peeled. 
 You are familiar with the Pringle procedure, Dr. Browne? 
 Yes, although I've never... 
 Clamp down the portal triad with an atraumatic hemostat clamp, then use a number   catgut suture. 
 Shaun, just go to her and explain. 
 If what I said made her uncomfortable, then saying more could make her more uncomfortable. 
 I sliced instead of peeled. 
 After Michelle's surgery, I will go and talk to Carly. 
 Good. 
 You can talk to her soon. 
 OR   had a cancellation. 
 Your surgery is in    minutes. 
 Hi, I'm Dr. Browne. 
 I will be performing Michelle's surgery. 
 I will be removing her gallbladder. 
 It is a simple procedure. 
 We're gonna make sure your daughter is well taken care of. 
 Ow! 
 Sir, we need to decapitate it. 
 No, don't. I'm begging you. 
 Don't. 
 Please. 
 I can't get an image. 
 How did that... 
 I-Is that a swordfish?

 I hooked him with a naked ballyhoo.

 Suddenly, he just leapt out of the water. 
 He came right at me. 
 Save the story for the bar, Quint. 
 Right now, we need to cut the damn thing in half. 
 No.   -plus years I've been chasing a fish like this. 
 You can't just behead him! 
 Can't leave his nose in your leg, either. 
 His bill. 
 Can't you just pull him out gently? 
 I'll sign a waiver. 
 The pull-out method never works. 
 If any of your blood vessels are damaged, it gets messy. 
 Congrats. I hear your surgery is on the schedule. 
 How's his distal pulse? 
 A little thready, but still there. 
 We need to get him to an MRI. 
 I'm not going anywhere without Franklin. 
 I named him after my father. 
 You and Franklin both won't fit. 
 Aah! Oh! Oh! 
 How? You said he was dead! 
 I didn't take a pulse. 
 Go get something to k*ll it. 
 - No, it's dead! 
 - It's moving! 
 It's a postmortem response. 
 You guys are doctors. 
 Don't people do this? 
 - No! 
 - No! 
 I'll help you review at lunch. 
 Surgery's in    minutes. 
 - Good luck. 
 - You, too. 
 I want to... 
 No, no, I haven't looked. 
 I want to be... 
 Great. ...great... 
 Okay. 
 - ...or nothing. 
 - Nothing. 
 Got it. I'll be back as soon as I can. 
 Hi. You must be Michelle's mother. 
 I'm Dr. Browne. I'll be... 
 Yeah. How long will she have to stay in here? 
 Hospitals make me nervous. 
 Three days to a week, depending on... 
 Well, she's gonna miss a lot of school. 
 And she watches Tisha and her brothers in the afternoon. 
 Your daughter has a serious infection in her gallbladder. 
 She's been experiencing symptoms on and off for a while now. 
 She never told me that. 
 Why didn't you tell me that? 
 - Mama... 
 - My point is, she's been ill for a while, so her recovery may take... 
 Mom. 
 Mom? 
 P-Please, my... my chest hurts. 
 What's wrong? 
 Her oxygen levels are dropping. 
 She's tachycardic. 
 I need a chest CT, stat. 
 You had a blood clot in the artery that feeds your lungs. 
 It's called a pulmonary embolism. 
 This medicine broke it up. 
 How could that happen? 
 According to our scan, it was part of a larger clot in your leg that broke off and traveled there. 
 As for why the larger one formed, when I asked you if you were taking birth control pills, you said no. 
 Was that the truth? 
 You asked me in front of Tisha. 
 I'm doing it with my boyfriend, and I don't want babies, so I'm taking birth control pills. 
 How long have you been taking them? 
 I don't know. A year? 
 I'm prescribing condoms for your boyfriend. 
 You need to go off the pill to prevent further clots. 
 Dr. Browne is gonna place an IVC filter via your femoral vein, in case other parts of the clot break off. 
 Your gallbladder surgery's gonna have to wait till tomorrow. 
 What are you doing? 
 This is where the catheter goes in. 
 How did you get these scars? 
 I cut myself climbing a fence. 
 Those scars... 
 They're straight, in a row, all the same length. 
 I don't believe you got them from a fence. 
 I don't care what you believe. 
 Kids who cut, most of them are really sad, in a lot of pain, and they say cutting makes them feel better. 
 Is that how it is with you? 
 I don't want to talk about it. 
 Okay. 
 My life sucks, okay? 
 Tell me how. 
 Why? 
 It won't change anything. 
 Talking might make you feel better, and maybe I can help. 
 I live in a foster home, but I'm not a foster kid. 
 I'm a whole mother, but I've never had a baby. 
 My mom brought three kids in our home, and now it's my job to take care of them... 
 Make breakfast, get the kids dressed, take them to school, go to school, 
 pick them up, dinner, homework, laundry. 
 Repeat. 
 I barely ever leave the house without a kid attached to me. 
 Can you help me with that? 
 Michelle wouldn't hurt herself on purpose. 
 Michelle is unhappy. She feels pressure to look after her foster siblings, help out at home... 
 Yeah, her home life is fine. 
 I'll talk to her. 
 It might be helpful to have her speak with a psychiatrist. 
 My daughter is not crazy. 
 We... We don't do psychiatrists. You know that. 
 That needs to change. 
 When are you doing her surgery? 
 - Tomorrow. 
 - Thank you. 
 I will speak to my daughter. 
 Don't. 
 It's your job to fix her gallbladder, not her life. 
 It's your first surgery. 
 Don't get distracted. 
 Have you talked to Carly? 
 No. 
 Blood pressure is   /  . 
 Your patient is in cardiac arrest. 
 I know. 
 You're practicing the Pringle maneuver in the event of a liver bleed? 
 Yes. 
 - That was better. 
 - Thanks. 
 Now you can talk to Carly. 
 I need to practice. 
 Dr. Lim says getting away from things every now and again, having balance in our lives  can be just as important to our performance as practice. 
 Maybe you should get some balance by talking to Carly. 
 I don't know. 
 I'm nervous about my surgery, Shaun. 
 Practice will make me less nervous. 
 That will improve my performance. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 You should also practice not causing a liver bleed. 
 Planning on it. 
 Also, how you will recover if you cut the portal vein. 
 That's potentially fatal. 
 Or if you perforate the small bowel, which could cause sepsis, leading to death. 
 Or if you cut the common bile duct, 
 - which would cause... 
 - I'm gonna go talk to Carly. 
 - Right now? 
 - Right now. 
 - Aren't you still nervous? 
 - Nope, all better. 
 What blade for the Kocher? 
 What? 
 Incision for the chole... what blade? 
 Uh... 
 -   . 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 No, they won't both fit in the MRI. 
 Fish Boy doesn't buy it. 
 Location of the incision. 
 Why are you trying to help me? 
 Lim picked you for the first surgery. 
 Everyone knows that makes you the front-runner for Chief Resident. 
 This is me sucking up. 
 I've never been big on pretense... 
 Are you okay? 
 What the hell just happened? 
 The marlin must have had metal in his body... 
 Lures and stuff. 
 I think a license plate flew by me. 
 Franklin! 
 Oh, no! 
 Franklin! 
 Oh, it's okay. 
 Franklin's okay. 
 It all came out one side. 
 It won't show when I mount him. 
 Well, thank goodness for small miracles. 
 - Ooh. 
 - Oh! 
 Ow! 
 Oh! Ah! 
 I've got his femoral. 
 Call the OR. We're coming. 
 Hang on, Dr. Browne. 
 Just need to make an incision above and below the arterial injury site. 
 We need to clamp the femoral proximal to the bleed without clipping the femoral nerve. 
 Got it. I feel the nerve right above my index finger. 
 One down. 
 My hand is starting to cramp. 
 Lean over this way a little bit. 
 Rotate your wrist. 
 Just a little bit more. 
 Let's see if that holds. 
 Go get cleaned up. 
 We'll take it from here. 
 I wanted to check the patient's bloodwork. 
 He's negative for HIV, Hep B and C. 
 You don't need prophylactic meds. 
 I'm nervous about my surgery. 
 You'll be fine. 
 And don't ever say that again. 
 Why? 
 Weren't you nervous before your first lead? 
 If I was, I didn't volunteer that to the Chief of Surgery... 
 Or anyone. 
 We're women, we're not white, and we're surgeons. 
 Unicorns consider us a fabled species. 
 We don't get the luxury of public insecurity. 
 I will aspire to repressed stoicism in the future. 
 We don't need to be insecure, because every step of the way, we've had to be twice as good as everybody else. 
 Suck it up. 
 You got this. 
 Don't forget we have our session with Dr. Donovan today. 
 I won't.

 Woman. 
 Girl, actually. 
 She's tough, smart... really sad. 
 Her mom has her taking care of three foster kids. 
 At least you were only stuck looking after me. 
 How old?

 Although she acts a lot older. 
 She's been having sex for almost a year. 
 Well, you were about that age when you were with Wayne. 
 - I didn't have sex with Wayne. 
 - What? 
 He was in love with you, always sniffing around our place. 
 Maybe. He didn't get any. 
 So, who? 
 Junior prom guy... Derek. 
 Der... No. 
 I didn't lose my virginity until sophomore year of college. 
 What were you hoping for, a proposal? 
 No. 
 I wanted it to be special. 
 Oh, good for you. 
 I mean, I wouldn't have held out... 
 - No. 
 - ...but good for you. 
 I thought for sure you and Wayne were doing it. 
 You were okay with that? 
 You were so serious. 
 So restrained. 
 We talked about birth control. 
 I figured, ""Good for her. 
 She's finally relaxing, having some fun."" 
 Well, I was so restrained and serious 
 'cause I never knew when you were gonna fall apart. 
 Got to get to work. 
 I'll be back before Michelle goes into surgery. 
 Have you had a chance to talk to her about her cutting? 
 Oh, yeah, some fool friend of hers gave her the idea. 
 She's not unhappy. It's just peer pressure. 
 She sounded unhappy to me. 
 She's upset I didn't let her go hang out with her friends. 
 It's typical teen drama. 
 She promised me she's done cutting. 
 Self-harming behavior doesn't just stop. 
 - Michelle might need... 
 - Dr. Browne. 
 My daughter needs to have surgery and get out of this hospital. 
 You didn't tell your mom the truth about why you cut yourself, about how unhappy you are. 
 I tried. 
 She didn't want to hear it, just said that things aren't always gonna go my way and I need to be more responsible. 
 Like I'm not already. 
 Growing up, I had to take care of my mom. 
 What was wrong with her? 
 She's mentally ill. 
 Bipolar disorder and a drinking problem, pills. 
 When things were bad, she'd forget to buy groceries or clean the trailer or pick me up. 
 Or she'd spend all our rent on something stupid. 
 And I thought if I could make her life easy enough... 
 If I cooked and cleaned and got good grades... 
 Then she'd get better. 
 But she never did. 
 And for the longest time, I thought it was my fault she was sick. 
 And I probably still would if a psychiatrist hadn't refused to believe me when I said I was fine. 
 You've been to a psychiatrist? 
 But you're, like, a fancy surgeon. 
 I could have a therapist come by and see you before your surgery. 
 Okay. 
 He should be getting better. 
 It's got to be an infection from the marlin. 
 Aeromonas or mycobacterium marinum. 
 Would've responded to the antibiotics. 
 Guys, I'm trying to focus. 
 What if he has an underlying autoimmune disorder? 
 It could've been triggered by the surgery or even the initial fish stabbing. 
 It would explain why the leg ulcerations are progressing despite good arterial flow. 
 We could see if he responds to steroids. 
 Which could k*ll him if it is an infection. 
 But we could run an ANA, see if he's positive. 
 What about a parasite? 
 Rhinosporidium seeberi or a gill worm. 
 Have you talked to Carly? 
 Sorry. 
 I got sidetracked by a marlin. 
 Come in. 
 You wanted to see me? 
 Ms. Reynolds tells me that you went against her wishes and had her daughter speak with a psychiatrist. 
 Uh, Michelle asked to see a therapist. 
 Only after you talked her into it. 
 I'm gonna report you to the medical board. 
 You had no right... 
 Dr. Browne, were you concerned that Michelle might be a serious danger to herself? 
 Yes. 
 In that case, the consult was required. 
 That said, Dr. Browne's failure to inform you was inappropriate. 
 You're off the case. 
 Dr. Melendez will perform the surgery. 
 How are you doing? 
 Claire? 
 I understand today's a big day for you. 
 Your first surgery. 
 We don't need to talk about that. 
 Hmm, I think we do. 
 You've been taking care of your mother for a long time. 
 That's a pattern you both need to break out of. 
 I know I haven't always been there for you, and I just... I... 
 I'm trying to change that. 
 I know, Mom. 
 I'm good. Everything is fine. 
 And your first surgery? 
 Is that this afternoon? 
 It's... 
 Actually, it's not. 
 Um... 
 I arranged a psych consult without the mother's permission, so I got thrown off the case. 
 How could the hospital allow that? 
 What is wrong with them? 
 After how hard you've worked, I just... 
 It's okay, Mom. They kind of had to. 
 That must be a big disappointment... 
 It is. 
 Anything else, Claire? 
 I'm upset, humiliated, so, so mad at my patient's mother for not taking care of her daughter. 
 And I... I'm relieved. 
 I'm so, so relieved to have that weight off of me, and that makes me feel like a fraud. 
 Don't you say that. 
 How can I be so scared to do something I've wanted for so long? 
 Because things that matter are scary. 
 That's how I feel about coming here, talking about my life and our relationship. 
 What if I can't fix it? 
 What if I can't make up for all the times I've let you down? 
 And then I think... 
 ...""Just be like Claire."" 
 Because nothing stops you... ever. 
 You see what you want, and you go after it with everything you've got. 
 You are an inspiration. 
 You're my inspiration. 
 Carly? 
 Hi. Do you have a second? 
 OR   is waiting to learn the patient's mass wasn't cancerous so they can close. 
 I can come back after. 
 I'll be at the cafe? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - Okay. 
 Anesthesiology, line    . 
 Anesthesiology, call line    . 
 Cancer. 
 The marlin guy has cancer. 
 CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no masses. 
 It's in his leg. 
 It explains progressive ulcerations despite good arterial flow. 
 And why the antibiotics aren't working. 
 We'll send a tissue sample from the ulcerated area. 
 And when I'm Chief Resident, I'll remember this. 
 There's a problem with Michelle. 
 I'm not doing it! 
 You need to calm down. 
 You don't get to tell me what to do! 
 I want Dr. Browne! 
 Michelle? What's going on? 
 I want you to do my surgery. 
 I want her, Mama, not somebody else. 
 Dr. Melendez is gonna do your surgery. 
 He is a great doctor. 
 He's not you. 
 Y-You care about me. 
 Everybody here cares about you, Michelle. 
 Now, please sit down. 
 You could rupture your gallbladder. 
 I-I-I don't want to get better. 
 - Don't say that. 
 - It's the truth! 
 Michelle, you need this surgery. 
 That is all that matters... not whether I do it. 
 I'm gonna be there. 
 I will be watching from the gallery the whole time. 
 You just... You need... 
 You need to sit down. 
 The kid okay? 
 I had to pull you off. 
 If you made even the tiniest misstep during surgery, that mom would go from threat to lawsuit. 
 Is Patricia okay with me watching from the gallery? 
 No. 
 You can't remove her gallbladder from the gallery. 
 What? 
 You're doing Michelle's surgery. 
 How'd you get the mom to change her mind? 
 I explained that, given Dr. Browne's commitment to her daughter, she's the perfect choice to lead the surgery. 
 Especially with me over her shoulder the whole time. 
 Thank you for fighting for me. 
 That's what bosses do. 
 Let's go. 
 - You stood me up. 
 - Sorry about that. 
 What's up? 
 Shaun's a little worried he may have freaked you out with his... questionnaire the other night. 
 Oh, I thought it was cool. 
 Small talk bores the hell out of me. 
 Well, then, great. 
 I'll tell him. 
 Shaun got worried about that all on his own? 
 That doesn't seem like him. 
 I may have mentioned that people don't usually ask deeply personal questions on an early date. 
 Claire, I like you, but we don't really know each other. 
 And yet you decided how I was going to react to Shaun's questions, which isn't your business. 
 And you were wrong... 
 Totally, totally wrong. 
 Shaun and I don't need you or anyone else to run interference on our relationship. 
 Butt out. 
 Is everybody ready for a Time Out? 
 Dr. Claire Browne, lead surgeon. 
 Dr. Neil Melendez, attending surgeon. 
 Dr. Shaun Murphy, assisting. 
 Dr. Jan Lancaster, anesthesia. 
 Donna Petringa, scrub nurse. 
 Shani Walden, circulating nurse. 
 Patient is Michelle Reynolds. 
 We will be performing an open cholecystectomy. 
 All tools I need are confirmed to be present. 
 Estimated blood loss,     cc. 
 Patient will go to the ICU after surgery. 
 Is everybody in agreement? 
 Dr. Murphy, have you ChloraPrepped the site? 
 I have. 
 blade. 
 Sponge. 
 Top layer of abdominal muscle is exposed. 
 I'll need a Bovie to cut through. 
 Nice work, Dr. Browne. 
 Bookwalter Retractor. 
 I see the liver, and I need to better expose the inferior surface. 
 Retract the duodenum inferiorly, please. 
 Gallbladder exposed. 
 Dr. Browne? 
 There is more scarring than the imaging suggested. 
 True. 
 Talk through your approach. 
 I... grasp the gallbladder fundus forward and use a right-angle clamp in my suction to develop a plane around the gallbladder. 
 Kelly clamp, a right-angle clamp, and suction. 
 That was elegant use of the Kelly clamp. 
 I see the cystic duct and, behind it, the cystic artery. 
 I need my first assist to confirm that I have identified the common bile duct and it is out of the way. 
 Yes. Cutting the duct would be... 
 Very, very bad. 
 Move the gallbladder cranially a little bit. 
 Titanium clip applier. 
 You sure you have a clear view? 
 Making the cut. 
 She's hemorrhaging. 
 I can't see the source of the bleeding. 
 MAP is    and dropping. 
 What do you think is happening? 
 Most likely, my scissors' tip nicked the right hepatic artery. 
 It happens. 
 It's happened to me. 
 I need to clamp the common hepatic artery, repair the arterial wall with running  -  Prolene sutures. 
 That's what I would do. 
 Hey, hey, hey. Slow down. Slow down. 
 No running. No running. 
 Dr. Browne, how's my daughter? 
 The surgery was a success, and we expect a full recovery. 
 I wanna see her! 
 Is that okay? 
 - Yay! 
 - Okay. 
 Michelle says she wants to be a doctor. 
 She would be a great one. 
 Uh, that therapist Michelle talked to... 
 ...could I get her card? 
 - Hi, baby. 
 - Hey. 
 Okay. 
 Three, two, one. 
 You were right. 
 He had angiosarcoma of the leg. 
 Had to amputate, but the margins were clean. 
 - Hmm. 
 - What happened to the... 
 Franklin! 
 Oh! 
 Franklin, you amazing fish! 
 You saved my life. 
 Come on, bring him... bring him here. 
 Bring him... Bring him in. 
 Oh. 
 Thank you, guys. 
 Group hug. 
 Do you prefer to work in a team or do you prefer to lead or follow command? 
 Team... and to lead. 
 What machine or appliance in your house aggravates you the most? 
 The dishwasher.

 Message received from Mom. 
 Hey, baby. I got your text. 
 We're gonna celebrate. I'll see you soon. 
 I'm so proud of you, baby! 
 Here are flowers and chocolates. 
 Are you asking me out? 
 Yes. 
 I would love to. 
 Will we be doing this during all the commercials? 
 It's possible. 
 Hmm. 
 Patient came in through the celebrity track. 
 He was admitted through an entrance by the loading dock. 
 You're not to mention his name even to your colleagues. 
 What is his name? 
 Mitchell Stewart. 
 The conspiracy theorist? 
 That's a celebrity now? 
 A guy who thinks  /   was an inside job? 
 He's an ass. 
 He's an ass who needs liver surgery. 
 Whoa, whoa. Hold it right there. 
 Uhp! It's okay, Dex. They're on the list. 
 Drs. Murphy, Park, Andrews. 
 Mitchell Stewart. 
 I don't blindly turn over my well-being, or anything else, to those in authority, so I ran background checks on all of you. 
 Including Nurse Villanueva. 
 Nurse Villanueva is not a person in authority. 
 People can be gotten to... bribed, threatened. 
 And don't bother trying to hook up that IV until I know what you want to pump into me. 
 They're normal IV fluids, Mr. Stewart. Please. 
 I'm sure you consider whatever you give me to be normal medical treatment, but we all know that doctors are pushers in the pay of the drug companies. 
 The bag contains an isotonic crystalloid composed of  . % sodium chloride dissolved in sterile water. 
 Also, given that we will soon be drugging you into unconsciousness and cutting into your body, don't you have to trust us a little? 
 You must be the autistic guy. 
 Good. No bull. 
 Probably doesn't know what bull is. 
 Bet your parents got one of those combination vaccinations. 
 Not connected, because science does not support an autism link. 
 Yeah, that's what they told you. 
 Mr. Stewart, suppose we focus on what we'll be doing to halt the liver damage caused by your genetic condition. 
 Idiopathic portal hypertension can cause... 
 My liver is damaged, but that's not the cause. 
 I've been poisoned. 
 His internist heard the same theory. 
 Tox screen came back negative. 
 And KCNN  genetic testing confirmed the cause of his idiopathic portal hypertension. 
 He inherited it from his mother. 
 Worth running that tox screen again? 
 The guy has a Web show where he claims the parents of children who died in school sh**t are ""crisis actors."" 
 He's earned some enemies. 
 Once we start doubting the tests, then you can't trust anything and there's no point in anything. 
 We know our patient needs liver shunt surgery. 
 We're doing the surgery. 
 You were late. 
 Your mom keeping you up? 
 Singing at night again? 
 No. 
 She's been quiet. 
 Ms. Barstow, I'm Dr. Browne. 
 This is Dr. Reznick. 
 What seems to be the trouble? 
 Nothing much, really. 
 I feel silly for coming here, but Jonas insisted. 
 Because you aren't getting any better. 
 Lily likes to downplay her problems. 
 She's the rock, and I'm the wimp. 
 Ah, fuss, fuss, fuss. 
 I've just been a little off food for a few days. 
 You also have a fever. 
 Most likely, it's an infection. 
 Oh, my God! Lily! 
 Sir, please step back. Lay back for me. 
 We're gonna do an ultrasound. 
 Her pulse is up. 
 Blood pressure's up, too. 
 Uh... 
 Her appendix is ruptured. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Page anesthesia stat! 
 We're taking her to the O.R. 
 We need pre-op lab results. 
 Patient name? 
 Oh, we can't tell you. 
 Celebrity track. You'll find the results under the ID number. 
 Politics, arts, business? 
 Is it the President? 
 I'll give you a hint. 
 He's less popular. 
 Well, that's disappointing. 
 Once we get this cleaned up, we need to figure out why her brain isn't getting the right distress signals. 
 How should we go about that, Dr. Browne? 
 We do an FMRI. Stimulate her and see how her brain reacts. 
 Sorry. You asked Claire, but I have lunch plans. 
 I have a question. 
 Well, hopefully, it's a quick one. 
 I've cleared my schedule for the rest of the day. 
 Debbie and I are going to City Hall to get married. 
 Not gonna make a big fuss out of it. 
 You know, get dressed up, turn it into a big event. 
 After all, we are not kids anymore. 
 This is where you say ""Congratulations."" 
 Congratulations. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you and Debbie hold hands? 
 Yeah. Why? 
 Is that what Carly wants to do? 
 Yes. 
 She tried twice. 
 Have you tried to explain why it's difficult for you? 
 No. 
 Well, I... I'd start with that. 
 How can this be important? 
 It's a little thing. 
 Carly and I are compatible on so many big things... children, geographic preferences, work priorities, the use of headphones, potential color schemes for our home... 
 You have a checklist? 
 Yes. 
 Carly and I are still learning about each other. 
 It's not like you and Debbie. 
 You already know these things, or you wouldn't be getting married. 
 Four? 
 Five? 
 I'm feeling some pain. 
 We can stop. 
 We're not getting anything. 
 She's fine. 
 We need feedback. 
 Eight. 
 Nine. 
 Claire, she's not feeling pain. 
 The only activity is in the parietal. 
 Nothing in the limbic, nothing in the anterior cingulate cortex. 
 She's feeling touch. 
 - But why did she just say... 
 - My guess? 
 Because she's never felt pain. 
 She doesn't know what it is. 
 Sleep apnea. 
 What? 
 That poor guy over there, I think he's got sleep apnea. 
 Maybe he's just tired. 
 It's... It's one of the most important days of his life, and he can't stay awake. 
 Maybe you could... you could tell him that there are treatments. 
 Me? 
 Otherwise, he's gonna keep his wife awake snoring for the rest of his life. 
 It's gonna destroy their marriage. 
 You seem very sure about that. 
 There's literally no greater t*rture than not getting a good night's sleep. 
 All right, first of all, I don't think you mean literally no greater t*rture. 
 Oh, no. It's true. 
 Once when I was in the Merchant Marine... 
 Merchant Marines? 
 It's... It's ""Marine."" No ""S."" 
 - You were in the Merchant Marines? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 And we were stationed off the Azores, and every night, we were driven crazy by these loud, just, like, strangled sounds. 
 Turns out it was just a bunch of cagarro birds. 
 We were literally hearing the sound of Daffy Duck drowning. 
 'Course, that was nothing compared to what happened in Valparaiso. 
 Are you okay? 
 Sorry. 
 It's just, I... I'm not feeling so good. 
 You're not feeling well? 
 I can't do this. 
 What? 
 Is that it? 
 Are we finished? 
 Yeah, we're gonna get you out. 
 Uh, just a couple more questions. 
 Your mother died age    of a heart attack. 
 Were you there when that happened? 
 Yes. I called the ambulance. 
 She died while we were waiting. 
 Check the anterior cingulate cortex. 
 Physical pain and emotional pain are processed through the same areas. 
 Nothing. 
 But we don't know how she feels about her mother. 
 It's your mother. When she goes, there is a vacuum. 
 What about your husband? 
 Has he had any problems lately? 
 He had a cancer scare about a year ago. 
 Slight activity here, but it's pretty weak. 
 You want to argue that she doesn't like her mother and her husband? 
 Wow. Sh... 
 She's like... a superhero. 
 Nothing can really hurt her. 
 Is everything okay? 
 Your right hand is red. 
 Starting to swell. 
 What does that mean? 
 Infection. 
 Hello. Your surgery went well. 
 If there are no delayed complications, you should be discharged in a few days. 
 Hey! 
 That's great, but what about the big picture? 
 Once I'm out of here, I'll go back to being poisoned. 
 You make many statements that have been proven wrong. 
 Do you really believe them? 
 You want to untangle what's real and what's for show? 
 Now you're talking. 
 Okay. 
 Do you think vaccination damage is being covered up? 
 Yes. 
 Do you think the parents of children k*lled in school sh**t are ""crisis actors""? 
 I can't answer for individuals, but I do believe there's a force in this country that wants to scam our people into laying down their arms. 
 But I no longer think there's a pedo-sl*ve-ring in a basement under that pizza joint. 
 That was a wrong call. 
 What did you do when you realized you'd made an error? 
 Nothing. 
 No apologies, no admissions. 
 The second you say you were wrong, they'll make it seem like everything you know is wrong. 
 You can't give them that amm*nit*on. 
 Then you're not really offering the truth. 
 Maybe if people saw you admit you were wrong, maybe they'd believe you more. 
 No. 
 There is no middle ground. 
 Compromise is a scam. 
 When only one side can get what it wants, make sure it's yours. 
 We have to surgically remove all infected tissue. 
 Immediately. Stop it from spreading. 
 We discovered that Lily can't feel pain, which is why the appendicitis went untreated, causing a widespread infection. 
 I can't... feel pain? 
 That makes no sense. 
 Whatever stimulation your nerves receive, your brain doesn't acknowledge it as pain. 
 No, I feel pain. 
 Do you? Because I'm pinching you. 
 I feel it. 
 But you didn't jump or react. You felt it as a touch. 
 Physical or emotional pain, it doesn't matter. 
 Okay, let's go. O.R.  . 
 Stop hiding. 
 I'm not hiding. I'm thinking. 
 Well, I've done my thinking, and what I've come up with is, 
 I deserve a better explanation than ""I can't do this."" 
 Because that was humiliating. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You're sorry? 
 What does that mean? 
 Are we going back tomorrow? 
 Never? What? 
 You are the one that proposed to me. 
 You're the one that told me how happy our being together makes you. 
 It makes me happy. It does. 
 But when I proposed to you, y-you even said, ""I don't know you."" 
 Is... Is that what this is about? 
 Because I was... 
 Because I was in the Merchant Marine? 
 I mean, yes, okay, I... I... I... it makes me wonder what else I don't know about you. 
 But more importantly, it makes me realize you don't know anything about me. 
 I am really annoying. 
 I'm easily irritable. 
 Like when people use the word ""literally"" about things that aren't literal. 
 I am impossible to live with. 
 Maybe literally. 
 That's been made very clear to me in the past. 
 I don't want to go two years and get divorced. 
 Divorcing you would hurt. 
 Thank you. 
 But that's a bunch of crap. 
 You know that, right? 
 We have different personal styles. 
 You like to examine things from every angle, and I... I like to take a leap into the dark every now and then. 
 You're right. 
 I am not a leaper. 
 I am a toe-dipper. 
 Takes me two hours to get into the ocean even when it's warm. 
 I know that you're good for me. 
 And I know that I'm good for you, Aaron. 
 Since meeting me, you've jumped ship from a comfortable career because you decided that you were missing something. 
 And... you asked a complete stranger to marry you. 
 Who knows what's next? 
 I guess you'll have to keep thinking. 
 Dr. Browne, widen the debridement. 
 Extending the incisions proximally. 
 Her husband thought she was a rock. 
 Turns out she's a rock because nothing matters to her. 
 You're making assumptions. 
 We were monitoring her reaction to pain. 
 Love wasn't part of the test. 
 You care, you hurt. 
 Maybe not Lily. 
 She married this man. 
 She stayed with him for years. 
 Maybe for her, love can exist without the pain of loss. 
 That would be paradise. 
 There is way more necrotic tissue here than I expected. 
 She's gonna lose the hand. 
 Well, if anyone can handle bad news... 
 Are you going to take my hand? 
 Not right now, no. 
 I don't like to hold hands. 
 Either we hold hands or we don't. 
 There's no compromise. 
 Only one of us can get what they want. 
 - I guess that's true... 
 - It should be me. 
 Holding hands makes me uncomfortable. 
 Not holding hands doesn't make you uncomfortable. 
 That show we watched the other night... it had a happy ending. 
 Because they stopped the story in a good place. 
 But in real life, it's gonna get dark and cold out there. 
 All we have... is this. 
 This says we're in it together, we've got each other's back, that we'll hold each other up for as long as we can. 
 I can say all those things verbally. 
 You could shout them, and it wouldn't say it as loud as this. 
 You said that not holding hands wouldn't make me uncomfortable, but it would. 
 I would feel... 
 ...separate. 
 It's all right. 
 You've actually been lucky, considering you have no warning system. 
 You need to be doing self-checks... knees, feet, elbows, hands. 
 Look for bruises, discolorations. 
 Anything at all that changes could be dangerous... life-threatening. 
 But there's another option. 
 Naloxone affects the central nervous system. 
 It's been shown to block the action of pain-lowering endorphins. 
 It could give you the ability to feel pain. 
 I don't see the point. 
 I've been fine so far. 
 Guess that sounds a little silly. 
 I know... I just lost a hand. 
 But now I know about checking myself, and I'll be a lot more careful. 
 Why is one gesture so important? 
 Carly still pushing you to hold hands? 
 No. 
 I tried, and she said it was all right. 
 Huh. 
 You should give me context for that ""Huh."" 
 She wants it. 
 She's just given up. 
 Good. 
 No. 
 Not if it's gonna bother her for the rest of your relationship. 
 Which may not be very long. 
 Huh. 
 Uh-oh. 
 We need to do imaging to make sure the problem isn't the shunt, then check there isn't a clot causing backup... 
 The surgery was a success, but I'm still being poisoned? 
 No. The surgery was a success, but your liver's still deteriorating. 
 We don't know why. 
 Jen, check me out of here. 
 Find another hospital. 
 I can't approve that, Mr. Stewart. 
 You're in no condition 
 - to leave the hospital 
 - You just confirmed that someone in this hospital is poisoning me. 
 You want me to cooperate with the suspects? 
 Another hospital wouldn't solve your problem. 
 People can be gotten to. 
 Bribed or threatened. 
 Right. Someone here wants to k*ll me. 
 No one is trying... 
 Let's constrain some of these variables. 
 One person touches me. 
 Him. 
 He doesn't know how to lie. 
 Oh, I can lie. 
 Yes, but not successfully. Good choice. 
 Will I be able to play tennis? 
 Yes... eventually. 
 Funny... I never could before. 
 You always take things well. 
 We had to pick up and move from Durham. 
 Well, that was for your job. 
 No sense in moping about it. 
 The miscarriage. 
 You never talked about it, so... 
 I never talked about it, I didn't want to hurt you. 
 But... did you not talk about it because you just weren't thinking about it? 
 What are all these questions for? 
 I thought we were carrying the load together, knowing how each other felt. 
 This isn't about us. 
 This is just... a medical condition. 
 If I died, would you care? 
 Would you miss me, or, uh, would you just... move on? 
 Would you want me to be miserable? 
 I want it to matter. 
 Of course it matters. 
 You know I love you. 
 Jonas. 
 Maybe... you think it's love, but it's like the pain... it just doesn't go that deep. 
 But isn't it possible for me to love you without it being all wrapped up in suffering? 
 But that's how it works. 
 When you lose someone, it shouldn't be like your hand. 
 It should ache. 
 That's right, isn't it? 
 That's what loss feels like? 
 I need to get away for a while. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Next, we're going to test you for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver. 
 Those are diseases whose symptoms overlap yours. 
 They might have been masked by your idiopathic portal hypertension. 
 Nurse Villanueva. Welcome. 
 But you know I'm not gonna touch that. 
 The dietician ordered it for you, and I'm required to bring it. 
 What are you eating if you're refusing hospital food? 
 Uh... 
 grams of protein a day. 
 - Kale and baby greens. 
 - Hey. 
 ""Leopard Spring."" 
 Jen, Dex, you mind stepping out? 
 It's Chinese herbs. 
 To make you feel younger, more energetic, more... virile. 
 You don't feel virile? 
 Of course I do, but there's nothing wrong with feeling more virile. 
 I need strength for the fight. 
 You're not talking. Is there a problem? 
 No. These herbs are harmless. 
 You asked about my virility. 
 I was curious. 
 We're going to test you for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver. 
 What's up? 
 I tested a patient for autoimmune hepatitis and fatty liver. 
 What's up with you? 
 Our patient decided to take the dr*gs. 
 Because I guess a husband walking out can make an impression even on a woman who feels no pain. 
 That's a lot of paperwork for two tests. 
 They were negative. 
 I thought I might find something in his mother's old records that could help, but no, no. 
 Her case was straightforward. 
 His parents were both alcoholics, but her liver was already weakened by her condition. 
 Parents both alcoholics? 
 No wonder he thinks people in authority like to deny the truth. 
 He's grown up now, Claire. 
 No longer in that position. 
 There's still plenty of lying going on in the world. 
 That's not a situation you outgrow. 
 Yes. 
 There is a lot of lying. 
 Want to hear my theories? 
 Fight with your mother is number one. 
 You're debating whether to throw her out. 
 This theory explains what? 
 Why the usually compassionate Dr. Claire Browne envies a woman who feels no pain. 
 You're miserable, torn. 
 You don't know what to do to make your own pain go away. 
 Want to hear my theory? 
 People that aren't you are doing great, so you're looking for a toy you can break, a pet you can t*rture. 
 - Is she in pain? 
 - No. 
 What are her vitals? 
 Vitals are fine. 
 Then how can she be in crisis? 
 I don't know. But she is. 
 Lily? 
 Are you okay? 
 Lily? 
 I never noticed how ugly the walls are. 
 I've discovered the cause of your liver problem. 
 Really? Fatty liver? Autoimmune? 
 I've never had any symptoms of... 
 No. You were being poisoned. 
 What? 
 Who? Do you know who? How? 
 I thought maybe the dose of herbs 
 listed on the bottle was wrong... 
 There's a toxic dose in there? 
 No. There are no herbs at all in here. 
 It contains sildenafil. 
 It's the active element in Viagra. 
 It promotes blood flow in your penis. 
 I know what it does. 
 They say it's natural herbs. 
 They lied. 
 Your idiopathic portal hypertension means your liver is vulnerable to abuse. 
 The amount of sildenafil in here wouldn't k*ll most people, but if someone with pre-existing liver issues took it every day... 
 You were right. 
 You've been poisoning yourself. 
 It's good news. 
 Those Communist bastards. 
 I think they're based in San Pedro. 
 Mr. Barstow. 
 Is Lily all right? 
 She's on medication to reverse her pain-free condition, but it's hit her hard. 
 She's being wrung out by all the negative thoughts and feelings the rest of us have all built calluses against. 
 But she made the right choice? 
 I mean, she needs this to be safe. 
 I don't think she's doing this to be safe. 
 I think she's doing this because you walked out. 
 Why? 
 You were happy for years. 
 Now you're sure you can't be happy unless your wife changes? 
 I want her to feel everything I feel. 
 The love, the pain... everything. 
 Wouldn't you? 
 The residents in this hospital work long hours. 
 You know why? 
 Because the surgeons in charge worked long hours when they were residents. 
 They suffered, so we have to suffer. 
 It's human nature. 
 What does that... 
 But someone like your wife, so invulnerable, it's... it's like she's gotten away with something. 
 It's hard not to resent her. 
 Sure, we want to ""cure"" her, but how much of it is... is to give her a warning system, and how much is because we want to pull her down into hell with the rest of us? 
 Are you married now? 
 No. 
 I chickened out. 
 Apparently, I don't like change. 
 Change makes me very nervous. 
 I'm not the easiest man in the world to live with. 
 My first wife made that very clear. 
 It's true. 
 You can be very irritating. 
 Are you saying I shouldn't get married? 
 Are you asking for my advice? 
 Yes. 
 You've never really asked before. 
 And this is an important decision. 
 Your happiness depends on it. 
 This is huge. 
 Well? 
 Oh. I don't have any advice. 
 I don't even understand the issue. 
 I also don't understand why you asked when you've already made up your mind. 
 What? 
 You usually call her your ex-wife. 
 You just called her your ""first."" 
 It implies a second. 
 Why are you staring in your trunk? 
 Something in here the answer to your problem? 
 Yoga mat... gym bag.. 
 Extra sneakers... 
 Here's a little earthquake kit. 
 So sensible. 
 Dirty towel. 
 Ooh! What's this? 
 Put it back. 
 It's my mom. 
 Why are you jumping? 
 I'm not jumping. I'm leaping. 
 Come on. Come leap with me. 
 We both can't leap on that thing. 
 Oh! 
 Are you okay? 
 Never better. 
 Will you leap with me... to City Hall? 
 Yes, I will. 
 Also, I may have done something to my ankle. 
 Do you want me to... call someone... 
 Je ne regret nothing, baby. 
 I left the champagne because I was so ready for victory. 
 Now I don't even know what to do with the damn ashes. 
 Leave them on a shelf in the closet with the spare towels? 
 Put them down the disposal? 
 What did she want done with them? 
 It was stupid. I'm sure she was joking. 
 Yeah, everyone jokes in their will. 
 The Marine Science Center. 
 She loved sea lions. 
 She'd take me to see them all the time. It was a thing. 
 Any city we were in, ""I wonder if they have sea lions."" 
 You need to do it. Now. 
 No. No. 
 It is a pointless gesture because my mother is dead and she doesn't care. 
 Perfect. 
 The center's open this evening for an after-hours event. 
 We'll have to dress up. 
 The winner of tonight's vote for Most Fabulous Sea Creature, the vampire squid! 
 I feel ridiculous! 
 You look great. 
 You could give the vampire squid a run for her money. 
 Now let's find the sea lions. 
 You came back. 
 Yeah. 
 Thank God. 
 We'll stop this. 
 It'll be all right. 
 Doctor, you got to get this stuff out of her IV. 
 You don't need it. 
 If you have to be careful about getting hurt, I'll be there to help you. 
 The ""stuff"" was removed some time ago. 
 Before Dr. Browne went off-shift, she told me that Lily was experiencing some problems. 
 So I thought it best to discontinue the medication for a while. 
 She's as she was when you left her. 
 You never cry. 
 When I saw you sitting there, 
 I've never been so happy in my whole life. 
 I thought you didn't want to ""make a fuss."" 
 Yeah. 
 Who knew? 
 This seems weird. 
 It is weird. 
 Most people have some kind of ritual all ready for them so they don't have to think about this kind of stuff. 
 You got a prayer? 
 I'm not religious. 
 Neither was my mom. 
 Everybody has a religion. 
 Not everybody has a god, but everybody has a religion. 
 Music. 
 Your mother's religion was music. 
 Sing. 
 By the sea lion colony at a drag pride party? 
 Or you can just dump it out and feel weird.

 How about we don't wait 12 minutes for our next kiss? 
 We would never see the end of the movie. 
 Oh. 
 Mm. 
 It's better if we stick to the schedule. 
 Sure. 
 Didn't hear you come in last night. 
 So I'm guessing it went well at Carly's. 
 The end of the movie was very predictable. 
 Not the question I was asking, but you still managed to answer it. 
 Carly touches me when we kiss. 
 You don't like her touching you? 
 - Oh, I I do. 
 - Oh. 
 But I prefer to touch only one thing at a time. 
 Have you told her you prefer to touch only one thing at a time? 
 In those exact words? 
 Oh! 
 Whatever it is, I'm definitely in. 
 My first lead surgery! 
 - Oh! 
 - Oh! 
 Shaun! 
 That is awesome! 
 I am going to rock it! 
 Oh, hells to the yeah you are! 
 Oh! 
 How you doing? 
 I'm good. 
 Thank you for helping me with the sea lions. 
 I'll never say no to a caper. 
 But I'd like to keep my mother's death between the two of us. 
 I just I can't deal with people's platitudes right now. 
 Okay, but that kinda suggests you're not good. 
 This is textbook denial. 
 It's only going to inhibit your grief process. 
 Denial is the first step in the grief process, so I'd say I'm right on track. 
 But thank you for your platitudes. 
 This is Curtis. 
 He decided to fix his chimney without a safety harness. 
 He has open bilateral tib-fib fractures. 
 They wanted $1,200 for a two-hour job. 
 And I can still do a Hurricane Grind. 
 It's a skateboard move that builds off a 180 Ollie. 
 I got great balance. 
 Pupils are slow to react. 
 Unfortunately, balance is less great after a few cocktails. 
 Not me. 
 Clean and sober six years, three months, and and 24 days. 
 Get him on IV antibiotics and to OR Level One. 
 And run a BAC. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Shaun Murphy. 
 Your surgeon. 
 Esophageal cancer is a serious condition. 
 However, you don't have any remote or metastatic disease and responded well to chemoradiation, so a resection of the esophagus should render you cancer-free. 
 You look awfully young. 
 I always say, the younger they are, the smarter they must be. 
 Oh, oh, yes. 
 We will pull the stomach up and attach it to the remains of your esophagus, keeping your GI system connected, so you will not need a permanent feeding tube. 
 My oncologist told me all this, but I refused to believe it that it was all gonna be okay until I heard it from my surgeon. 
 Oh! 
 I'm sorry, it's just I've been through a divorce and a career change and I finally bought my own cafe three days before I got my diagnosis. 
 And I thought it was a sign I was making a mistake. 
 But it was just the opposite. 
 I wasn't done. 
 Oh, I'm sorry I have to inform you of the risks of this procedure. 
 There is a 7% chance of heart and lung problems, a 12% chance of infection, a 0. 
 5% of death, among others. 
 Bring it, Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 Shaun got very lucky. 
 Landed the world's most genial patient for his first case. 
 - Nice. 
 - Of you. 
 You picked that patient for him I heard it was Park's chart before you stepped in. 
 Shaun's weakness is patient management. 
 You shouldn't be coddling him. 
 We challenge him too much, we lose him. 
 Murphy? 
 He perseveres. 
 He's annoyingly resilient. 
 I agree that some failures don't seem to faze him at all. 
 But it's his lifelong dream. 
 So, yes, I think we could lose him. 
 I'll tough-love his ass next week. 
 Okay, Curtis, we're good to go. 
 Curtis, my God. 
 Are you okay? 
 I'm thinking I should've gone with the contractor. 
 His thinking was impaired. 
 He had a blood alcohol level of . 
 09. 
 Your test must be wrong. 
 You were quite inebriated when you came in. 
 That's impossible. 
 Curtis doesn't drink. 
 We'll make a note of it in his chart. 
 We've got to get him to the O. R. 
 You play softball? 
 Uh, my junior year in high school, I had an ERA of 2. 95. 
 My wife's got an arm. 
 I can't believe you're my wife. 
 Till death do us part. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh, you found Wally. 
 You have a name for it? 
 Yeah, - he's my Walther PPK . 
 32; he and I go way back. 
 Is it loaded? 
 I mean, is this a problem? 
 'Cause I I just I keep it in my bedside table, in my g*n safe combination 7-3-5-9. 
 I'm not gonna remember that. 
 I don't want to remember that. 
 If we're gonna live together, we're gonna need to make some compromises. 
 You nervous? 
 How badly are you freaking out? 
 I'm not badly freaking out. 
 I've assisted in six esophageal resections, all of which were free of complications. 
 So you're overdue for a blow-up. 
 Sorry. 
 I'm just a bit annoyed 'cause I had my hand on this case first, and now I'm third out of four, at best. 
 But I'm happy for you. 
 Really. 
 I'm happy for me, too. 
 She has extensive scar tissue. 
 And it's plastered her stomach to her anterior abdominal wall. 
 I told her she wouldn't need a permanent feeding tube. 
 But she will. 
 We've got to tell a budding chef she'll never eat again. 
 How will she react? 
 Don't know. 
 Badly. 
 But the specifics You should tell her. 
 She's your patient, it's your job. 
 I'm bad at patient communication. 
 If I make her very unhappy, she may not want me to do the surgery. 
 If you're not willing to take that risk, then you should hand the case over to Park. 
 No. 
 I don't want to hand the case over to Dr. 
 Park. 
 Park will tell Beth. 
 And, Shaun, it's still your surgery. 
 Drill. 
 Do you see his heart rhythm? 
 Rate controlled A-fib. 
 Wasn't on his record. 
 Ask his wife about it post-op. 
 Probably a symptom of binge drinking. 
 Which he'll lie to us about and she'll tell us she believes. 
 She's in denial? 
 You had surgery as a child. 
 As a baby. 
 I don't even remember it. 
 There's considerable scar tissue more than we'd typically expect to find. 
 Which has affected our surgical plan. 
 How? 
 Dr. Murphy will field that question. 
 No, Dr. Lim s-said Proceed, Dr. Murphy. 
 Somebody please tell me. 
 We can't move your stomach up, so you will need a feeding tube. 
 For the rest of your life. 
 The good news is that this surgery is simpler, so your recovery time will be shorter by three to five days. 
 Hey. 
 Do any of you own a g*n? 
 Is there someone you'd like ""taken care of""? 
 - Ah. 
 - I still have my service p*stol. 
 I have a Sig P365. 
 Do any of you have, or have you ever had, issues about it with your significant others? 
 After our son was born, my wife suddenly hated having a firearm in the house. 
 And one night, I came home late to a PowerPoint presentation. 
 90 minutes of horrifying statistics. 
 Now it's in a locker at my g*n range. 
 Lotta set up but I like that. 
 I had a boyfriend who felt very weird about me having a g*n. 
 He wasn't big on logic, so I took the emotional approach. 
 Told him it's not for the firepower, it's for the confidence it gives me as a woman when I carry it. 
 I lived with a guy who had a g*n. 
 Had to use the nuclear option. 
 It goes or he goes. 
 It worked they both went. 
 Well, that's just wonderful. 
 I heard your news. 
 It's pretty exciting. 
 I jumped seven times. 
 How's the anxiety level? 
 Why do people keep asking me that? 
 Everyone has doubts, Shaun. 
 I'm excited. 
 You can be excited. 
 And nervous. 
 Usually they go together. 
 Speaking of, uh, I'm sorry if I was a bit too assertive last night. 
 Lea said it must be tricky for you. 
 So now Lea is also privy to the intimacies of our intimacy? 
 - Great. 
 - Yes. 
 Oh. 
 Lea said to tell you that I prefer to touch only thing at a time. 
 Located upper esophageal sphincter. 
 You have a good tumor margin resecting above or below? 
 - Below. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Shaun gave the news to his patient after all. 
 Shaun did what I expected. 
 He upset her, but the news is upsetting. 
 She'll deal with it, he'll learn how to She wants him off the case. 
 - Shaun - No Shaun, I will find you another case. 
 This is my case. 
 I prepared for this case. 
 I don't want another case. 
 Dr. 
 Murphy You're learning, Shaun. 
 That's what you do at a teaching hospital. 
 I'm learning, too. 
 Going from attending to Chief of Surgery is a big deal. 
 Every day, every decision, every mistake I learn something. 
 So do you. 
 No, I don't. 
 I have a developmental disorder. 
 - Come with me. 
 - I'm waiting for my bus. 
 You can take a later one. 
 I'm sure I mentioned I was Chief? 
 Hi, Beth. 
 I'm sorry for what you're going through. 
 And Dr. 
 Murphy's phrasing was unfortunate. 
 But there's been no deceit or negligence. 
 He's an excellent surgeon who has my full confidence in the O. R. 
 And if you don't trust him, you don't trust me. 
 So, I would recommend you have your surgery at a different hospital. 
 I can make arrangements. 
 However, if you reconsider, we can proceed as scheduled first thing tomorrow morning. 
 If you don't want people to know your mother died, stop acting like someone whose mother died. 
 I'm gonna move on to the second stage of grief anger. 
 I'm not acting depressed. 
 No, you're acting bitchy. 
 But you're not a bitch, so that looks weird on you, and people are gonna know something's up. 
 So, do you want me happier or sadder? 
 Let me know, because I'm really looking for your approval. 
 Bitchy You really think this guy's still on the wagon? 
 Just because he's a drunk doesn't mean he's not sick. 
 But all you can see is an addict married to an enabler, so all roads lead to rum. 
 C'mon, that was cute. 
 No IV wall motion abnormalities. 
 No valvular disease or dysfunction. 
 Ruling out any structural cause for the arrhythmia. 
 You win. 
 Congratulations. 
 - Hey! 
 - Hey. 
 How was your day? 
 Good, good. 
 Pensive. 
 I was thinking about your g*n and why you need it - Oh, Aaron, I I don't - No, no, no. 
 I was an idiot and a guy, I get it. 
 You walking alone in a garage late at night, you walking alone on the street late at night Or getting into my own car, or even my own house. 
 Exactly. 
 That's why I got you a surprise. 
 - Yeah? 
 - Right outside the back door. 
 We have exactly 10 seconds to punch in the code before S. E. A. L. Team Six arrives. 7-3-5-9. 
 Every door, every window, every vent over 36 inches. 
 This is your security fob. 
 Works in all 48 contiguous states and Canada. 
 You have no idea how much extra comfort this is gonna give me. 
 Actually, I was hoping it would be your primary source of comfort. 
 You were thinking that this would mean I would give up my g*n? 
 That's exactly what I was thinking. 
 Well, the first rule of security systems is redundancy. 
 By that logic, we should get a t*nk for the garage. 
 Aaron, it shouldn't matter why I want a g*n whether it's because it makes me feel more secure, or it was a memento of my dad's or just because it's fun to sh**t. 
 All that matters is I'm a grown-up, and I'm responsible, and I want it. 
 You're ruining Shaun. 
 Maybe you got him over the hump of patient management, but what about surgical management? 
 Taking charge of the O. R. , keeping lines of communication open, everyone cooperating. 
 You're throwing him into the deep end, and that's unfair to him. 
 Unless you plan to scrub in as a lifeguard. 
 He'll be fine. 
 You handpicked his surgical team? 
 You're ruining him. 
 The tests prove his arrhythmia is associated with excessive ethanol consumption. 
 But there's no permanent damage and his rhythm will return to normal in the absence of any further drinking. 
 We met when we were 15. 
 I was first clarinet, he was second. 
 We were at a band festival in Anaheim when he found out his parents died in a plane crash. 
 We grieved together and fell in love. 
 Then he started drinking. 
 It wasn't until I threatened to leave that he finally woke up. 
 The day he received his two-year recovery chip was the day we got married. 
 The day he vowed to me, and a church full of our family and friends, that he would never drink again. 
 Our marriage is built on his sobriety. 
 I believe him. 
 Teal, we ran the BAC three times, and the results were consistent. 
 I believe in my husband. 
 I have to. 
 His BP is dropping. 
 Temp is normal. 
 Check for causes of shock. 
 Upper GI bleed need stat hematocrits and transfuse blood. 
 Surgery's the easy-peasy part. 
 You wanted this, enjoy it. 
 I can't. 
 If I get distracted, if I get upset If you do, Andrews has your back. 
 If Dr. 
 Andrews has to take over, then I have failed. 
 I have failed, and I have endangered a patient's life, and if I'm no good at the easy-peasy part, then what part am I good at? 
 What do we do when we get all nutty like this? 
 Blow out the candles. 
 How many do you need? 
 Three. 
 Hey. 
 I was looking for you. 
 Big day, huh? 
 How are your nerves holding up? 
 I'm not nervous. 
 Of course you're nervous. 
 Everybody's nervous. 
 It just means that you care. 
 Being nervous means I feel inadequate and unprepared, and if I am either of those things, it doesn't matter whether I care or not. 
 You are more than adequate, and you're very prepared. 
 You remind me of a a young surgeon I knew once. 
 The day he got his first lead, he was thrilled, but he was a mess, trying to remember a million things, imagining a million things that could go wrong. 
 But then he remembered the birth process, how moms are asked to pick a focal point, - let everything filter through that. 
 - Hmm. 
 So, he chose the color orange to focus on. 
 This is the cap that he focused on, and he got through it with flying colors. 
 Maybe it'll help. 
 Why do you have the young surgeon's cap? 
 I was being coy. 
 The young surgeon was me. 
 Konnichiwa. 
 That's Japanese for hello. 
 Konnichiwa. 
 I have surgery in 42 minutes. 
 Which is why I'm here, to wish you luck. 
 I don't need luck. 
 Everyone needs luck. 
 That was a good luck kiss. 
 How can a kiss give you So was that. 
 I am feeling a bit lucky. 
 You know the thing that Lea told you to tell me? 
 Yes. 
 That was actually great advice. 
 It's important that we tell each other exactly what we like and what we don't. 
 I also don't like pickles, sirens, anything wool I was thinking more in the romantic area. 
 And right now, we are not going to touch lips anymore. 
 Because there's something else I want you to touch. 
 So, what do you think? 
 You don't have any lumps. 
 Win-win. 
 Lab and imaging tests rule out Crohn's, gastroenteritis, C-diff colitis, and even H pylori. 
 Leaving bleeding ulcers. 
 Caused by alcohol abuse. 
 He needs to be on a proton pump inhibitor and octreotide to prevent any further blood loss. 
 No. 
 He loves you. 
 That's why he hasn't been honest. 
 Doesn't make it right, but it's that same love that kept you together through everything. 
 And it'll get you through this, too. 
 He's telling the truth. 
 We'll run more tests. 
 Your faith in your husband is impressive. 
 But it may have just k*lled him. 
 Ten blade, please.

 No What's the matter? 
 No, no, no Shaun, what are you seeing?

 What what can't you do?

 - Yur - What happened? 
 - No, no, no. 
 - He lost it, walked out mid-procedure. 
 Yuri Yu Yuri kucho saiken. 
 Shaun? 
 Yur Yuri Yur Okay, Park, take over the surgery. 
 Y No! 
 Dr. 
 Park. 
 Y - No. 
 - He obviously can't. 
 I don't think he lost it. 
 He was in complete charge of that room. 
 I don't think this is a meltdown. 
 He said he can't do it. 
 He said, ""Can't do it. 
 "" Maybe he meant we can't do it. 
 I think he's seeing something We have a patient open on the table. 
 Shaun, you have to tell us what you're seeing. 
 It's okay, Shaun. 
 Breathe. 
 That's it. 
 Now slowly. 
 What are you thinking? 
 When Okay. 
 When I examined the upper portion When I examined the upper portion, there was a much larger area of tumor-free esophagus than anticipated That's correct, but not nearly enough to reach the stomach. 
 But there is enough to accept a jejunum free flap, using a portion of the small intestine to replace the resected esophagus. 
 We don't do jejunum free flaps. 
 They do in Japan. 
 They do in Japan. 
 I've been studying their technique Yuri kucho saiken. 
 They have had great success. 
 It would mean Beth wouldn't need a feeding tube. 
 But it is v-very complex. 
 It's too complex for you to lead. 
 So you'll lose your case. 
 Yes I haven't done a transposition graft like that before. 
 Think you can walk us through it? 
 Yes. 
 I'll scrub in. 
 Stomach is perfect. 
 Check the duodenum. 
 The only way Teal will accept the treatment is if we give her no room for denial. 
 Did you really believe what you said? 
 That their love is enough to get them through this? 
 Such BS, the belief that love is enough. 
 Even worse, it's corollary that a lack of love is the real problem. 
 If only they had someone in their life who had enough faith in them, had enough love for them, they could've pulled through. 
 It's wrong and it's mean. 
 What's that? 
 Flush the area. 
 There's our bleed. 
 But it's not coming from an ulcer It's coming from a tumor. 
 It's obstructing his digestive tract. 
 I'm paging Melendez to the O. R. 
 - Okay. 
 - Actually, I'm I'm gonna need an extra shot. 
 Rough day? 
 Had to help out in the E. R. with an eight-year-old boy who was accidentally shot by his sister. 
 He'll survive, but with brain damage. 
 That's horrible. 
 Yes, it is. 
 And quite coincidental. 
 Like so many other coincidences. 
 You know how many kids are shot every day in this country? 
 You know you're three times more likely to be shot if you have access to g*ns than if you don't? 
 Here's another fact one in four women are victims of v*olence at the hands of their intimate partner. 
 No, no, no. 
 I'm not afraid of you. 
 This isn't about you. 
 Did something happen? 
 'Cause if it did, I want to know about it. 
 You figure something horrible must have happened to drive me to such an irrational, fear-driven choice? 
 I'm sorry. 
 Hi. 
 The ends of the harvested jejunum have been matched for caliber size for the attachment sites. 
 You should begin proximal attachment at the neck incision, using layer-to-layer technique on the esophagus and microvascular anastomosis of the vessels. 
 You wanted to know when Dr. 
 Semler was heading to O. R. #3. 
 Dr. Park, scrub out and join Semler. 
 I-if it's all right, I'd rather stay here. 
 You're needed where you're needed. 
 Tumor is free. 
 Bag it, tag it, and get it to Path. 
 Do you smell that? 
 Smells like a distillery. 
 But we know he couldn't have touched a drop for at least 24 hours. 
 Final stitch is yours. 
 It's completely symbolic, but symbols can be powerful. 
 Easy-peasy. 
 You had something called Auto-Brewery Syndrome. 
 The tumor we found was blocking your intestinal tract. 
 So carbs weren't being digested, they were being trapped and fermented. 
 Your stomach was actually creating its own alcohol. 
 You were drunk, but not from drinking. 
 With the removal of the tumor which was benign you're all good. 
 And the arrhythmia's gone, too. 
 I never doubted you. 
 Her faith in you saved your life. 
 Thank you. 
 I was so pissed when Lim kicked me out until I found Semler had an appendectomy waiting for me. 
 Got my first lead after all. 
 I'm happy for you. 
 Really. 
 I'm happy for me, too. 
 You earned it. 
 And you'll get your chance again soon, Shaun. 
 So that's it? 
 All's well that ends well? 
 Your surgeon walked out on his case. 
 That's your takeaway? 
 That he failed? 
 A chef can eat. 
 Well, as a diagnostician, he did something wonderful, but as a surgeon? 
 Yes, he failed. 
 We don't work alone, Marcus. 
 Every time we have a good outcome, it's because everyone in the room did something right. 
 Shaun came up with the idea, Park got it out of him, I approved the surgery, and you? 
 The only reason Shaun is working here is because you believed in him. 
 Yay, team. 
 Are you still having a g*n fight? 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Second day of my marriage and we are at an impasse. 
 Tried the logical approach, I tried the emotional approach, no compromise. 
 Only thing left is the nuclear option, which really sucks. 
 The thought of having a g*n in my house makes me sick Has Debbie let you touch her breast? 
 What? 
 Has Debbie let you touch her breast? 
 Yeah. 
 Then you shouldn't worry about anything else. 
 I was wrong this time. 
 But 99. 
 9% of cases, I would be right. 
 If if someone acts like an addict, lies like an addict, smells like an addict, then they are an addict. 
 And just because we stumbled across the one ridiculously fluky exception, that isn't going to change my attitude moving forward. 
 I respect you, Claire. 
 Might even go as far as to say I like you. 
 And I know you're angry right now. 
 At your mother. 
 The world. 
 Yourself. 
 Eventually, that'll go away. 
 Or at least some of it will. 
 But until then, giving up on that 0. 
 1% means giving up on something else. 
 Hope. 
 Hope k*lled my mother. 
 We need to talk. 
 About the 800-pound g*n in the room. 
 I'm working on my compromise skills. 
 Okay. 
 Looks like your first lead surgery went well. 
 I didn't have a first lead surgery. 
 Yes. 
 It went very well. 
 Can I check your other breast?"
gdoc_3_6,6470478,3,6,"Sorry, Dr. Andrews. 
 I had a patient with some post-op arm pain. 
 How can I help you? 
 What's happened to all the nurses? 
 Hello. 
 My name is Dr. 
 Shaun Murphy, surgical resident year 3. 
 I will be assisted by Dr. 
 Claire Browne on today's open appendectomy. 
 I will not be putting on my number 7 sterile gloves myself, as I am lead surgeon. 
 Nurse Fletch, can you adjust the overhead light? 
 How many degrees, Dr. 
 Murphy? 
 Ah, yes. 
 I should be more specific. 
 A 35-degree angle. 
 Nurse Hawks, please hand me the 10 blade. 
 Straight clamp, please, Nurse Fletch. 
 Hello, Dr. 
 Andrews. 
 I'm going to try to pretend you're not here. 
 You have not pretended to scrub in and may not be here when here is there, there being O. R. 
 2 later today. 
 You don't need a full surgical team to rehearse. 
 Some of this staff needs to get back to their stations. 
 No. 
 They can stay here. 
 Chief Lim has assigned me my second first surgery, and she assigned them all to me and told me to rehearse with all of them unless and until there's an emergency on their floor. 
 Dr. 
 Browne, please hand me the Bovie. 
 Dr. 
 Browne had a dental appointment this morning. 
 I'm doing my best to be annoyingly caring and empathetic in her stead. 
 There's the baby. 
 And there's the mass. 
 Way too close together. 
 A biopsy is out of the question. 
 Best course is to go in and remove the entire mass. 
 Will that be dangerous for the baby? 
 The odds of your daughter being harmed are very low. 
 And what about recovery time? 
 How long? 
 Normal recovery is about three weeks. 
 We're opening a specialty toy store. 
 I need to be up and about in a week. 
 Tell 'em, Andre. 
 Sustainable natural toys. 
 Good for the kids, good for the world. 
 I don't really want to leave Andre to fight the crowds alone. 
 Well, a week is not realistic. 
 Too much stress on your body after the surgery could put the pregnancy at risk. 
 It's okay. 
 Andre worries. 
 Thought it was too much to start a business and a family all before our first anniversary. 
 Business and family are easy. 
 If I'd known it was business and family and cancer, I might have waited on one of them. 
 Let's just worry about the surgery right now. 
 Okay? 
 Dr. Lim. 
 Just came from Dr. Murphy's improv class. 
 I don't remember Browne getting a full-team rehearsal before her first surgery. 
 Our residents are not h*m*. 
 Each one requires different attention and training. 
 I agree. 
 And for Shaun, that means less training wheels and more scabbed knees. 
 Trust me, his knees will get scabbed. 
 I'm trying to prevent a decapitation. 
 If he's not ready Why don't you follow your own advice? 
 You think this is the wrong option, stop telling me. 
 Let me fail and learn. 
 But be sure to apologize when you realize I was right. 
 The appendix can be removed in various ways, including suture ligation, purse-stringing, and inversion appendectomy. 
 I will be using the suture ligation technique. 
 Dr. Browne, place a clamp just proximal to the distal ligature on the appendix. 
 How's it going with Carly? 
 Divide sharply and cauterize the exposed mucosa. 
 Isn't dating life wonderful? 
 Everything you hoped it would be? 
 Please refrain from asking non-surgical questions, Morgan. 
 I need to concentrate on the next step in my O. R. management. 
 And I need to be Claire. 
 Is there any chance she's not gonna be concerned about your personal well-being and inquire? 
 Repeatedly? 
 Things are going well, Dr. 
 Browne. 
 We make out a lot. 
 Let's close the peritoneal cavity. 
 Did you guys have lots of fun on your last day off? 
 - I went to the museum. 
 - Mm. 
 Nurse Hawks, please check the patient's vitals. 
 Everything looks normal. 
 You went alone? 
 I called Carly at her house to see if she wanted to play Chinese checkers. 
 Close the external oblique fascia with a continuous 2-0 vicryl stitch. 
 Although they're not really Chinese. 
 It's actually a game of German origin called Sternhalma. 
 It's very fun. 
 I will use 4-0 monocryl subcuticular interrupted sutures for skin closure. 
 However, Carly said she could not hang out because she was busy. 
 If the wound was contaminated, we could leave in a Penrose drain and remove it two to three days later, but it is not. 
 She had friends over. 
 I could hear laughing in the background. 
 Dr. Browne, approximate all split muscle layers. 
 That's odd. 
 Nothing is odd. 
 We just have two more steps and No. 
 That whatever she was doing, she didn't invite you. 
 Why? 
 She isn't treating you like a boyfriend. 
 You don't exclude your significant other from a get-together. 
 That's not true. 
 It could have been a family thing. 
 Or maybe she thinks it's too early to introduce you to her friends. 
 It's also possible that there was no get-together at all. 
 I mean, maybe you just heard the television. 
 Maybe she just doesn't see you as her boyfriend. 
 Has she ever called you her boyfriend? 
 We have practiced enough. 
 You had a dental appointment this morning. 
 The reason you're late. 
 So brush extra well and don't forget to floss. 
 Thanks. 
 Don't take this the wrong way, but when did you get so slutty? 
 I'm not. 
 Thank you for covering. 
 Now This smells like it's been dipped in Drakkar cologne. 
 Do you really care what I wear or what I do? 
 I care when you're late. 
 I care about the amount of extra work I have to do covering for you. 
 I was an hour late. 
 How much extra work could that be? 
 One hour's worth. 
 So, you can thank me by taking two hours off my hands. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, Shaun. 
 Hello. 
 Waiting for Carly? 
 I want to know why she did not invite me to her get-together. 
 Might have a better chance of finding out if you were physically closer to her. 
 Maybe later. 
 This prescription should help him feel a little bit better. 
 And if I may suggest, don't store the chocolate laxatives in the candy drawer. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hey. 
 I was wondering if you could get away for lunch. 
 Yeah. 
 Let me see if I can move some things around. 
 - Come on in. 
 - All right. 
 I got fired. 
 - What? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 What happened? 
 I was giving away free coffee. 
 We work in a hospital, and I hear a lot of sad stories. 
 And sometimes when they're really, really sad, I like to give that person a free coffee, and it makes them smile. 
 And yes, okay, I know. 
 It's against policy. 
 But you'd think my asshat boss would give me more than two warnings before giving me the ax. 
 Okay. 
 What do you want me to do? 
 You want me to beat him up? 
 I want you to come home for lunch and I want to bitch about my ex-boss and I want someone there to listen. 
 Okay. 
 Use a tenaculum to grasp the lesion to create countertraction. 
 I'm gonna separate the mass from the underlying myometrium. 
 Damn it. 
 Let's get suction. 
 The mass has surrounded the uterine arteries. 
 We can't remove the mass without k*lling the baby. 
 Dr. 
 Reznick, if you were lead, how would you proceed? 
 We're already in, so I'd biopsy the mass for testing. 
 Then I'd perform an embolization of the arteries feeding the tumor. 
 Very good. 
 Dr. Park, what does that do? 
 It should allow us to control the bleeding so we can close her up and leave the baby in place for two months. 
 That'll give the baby time to become viable outside the womb. 
 At that point, we go back in, safely take out the baby and the mass. 
 Sounds like the right call to me. 
 We'll be performing an embolization of the arteries feeding the tumor. 
 - I'll inform Chief Lim. 
 - Not necessary. 
 It's protocol to run all decisions about complex procedures by the Chief of Surgery. 
 There's only one clear path, which means there is no decision. 
 In my office, please. 
 I didn't think you'd mind. 
 We always complained about Andrews and his red tape. 
 Well, I hoped that our relationship was better than whatever you had with Andrews. 
 It is, but I know you're busy. 
 You don't need to be bothered You know how this makes me look? 
 You know how this makes me look? 
 This job was on your to-do list. 
 Lab must have made a mistake. 
 I'll deal with it. 
 We might have a bigger issue than you lying about the blood test. 
 I'm not lying. 
 Like I said, this is a bigger issue. 
 Shaun is distracted. 
 Well, why would he be Because you were at the dentist. 
 Nurse Hawks asked some questions. 
 Carly didn't invite Shaun to something, and now he's worried that they're not boyfriend and girlfriend. 
 So, did you talk to him? 
 No. 
 That's what you do. 
 Think I put it on your list ""be kind and care"" so I don't have to. 
 Okay. 
 I'll talk to him. 
 Talk to Carly first. 
 You can do it when you drop off the blood vials and pretend it's the second time. 
 This is good. 
 It's good. 
 You were wasted there. 
 I was happy there. 
 I love that hospital. 
 I lo I love the staff and the patients. 
 It just felt like home. 
 Here's a thought. 
 What if I come work with you? 
 I saw your waiting room. 
 You need the help. 
 We have an office manager. 
 She doesn't manage. 
 She's never there. 
 I-I was a nurse. 
 I could schedule your appointments. 
 I could, um, triage the walk-ins. 
 It's like a win-win. 
 I don't think we have the budget for for new employees. 
 Aaron, that's horse crap. 
 You're the president. 
 What's the real reason? 
 I-I think couples that are apart now and then, it's a good thing. 
 Couples together 24/7? 
 I mean, I don't want to get to the point where we come home and we run to opposite sides of the house. 
 Okay. 
 Just a thought. 
 I'm just gonna keep looking. 
 Hi, Carly. 
 Replacement vials. 
 For some reason, the bloodwork for Shaun's case was never processed. 
 Oh, that doesn't sound right. 
 Why is not all that important. 
 But if you could just put a rush on them. 
 If the tests get delayed any longer, then Shaun's surgery could get rescheduled. 
 There's no record of any bloodwork being dropped off for Shaun. 
 If the surgery gets rescheduled, then Shaun will lose his team, the team he's practiced with. 
 It might throw him, so if you could just Shaun doesn't get thrown by anything medical. 
 Shaun is already thrown. 
 For some reason, he has it in his head that you dissed him or something, that maybe there's a problem, and now he seems distracted, upset. 
 I I wondered if you could speak with him, let him know everything's okay. 
 I'll make sure to put a rush on the blood tests. 
 Thank you. 
 My wife says that the Earth is a womb and that when you garden, you become part of its birthing process. 
 Not that I mind sharing hobbies with her. 
 It keeps us close. 
 And I don't mind the dirt in my eyes. 
 Just could do with a little less of the talking. 
 I feel you. 
 You don't by any chance possess the power of flight? 
 Uh, what? 
 You have a wing in your eye. 
 Sorry? 
 Just hold still. 
 Ow. 
 Congratulations. 
 Your womb just gave birth to a bee. 
 Ugh. 
 Triplets, in fact. 
 Dr. 
 Glassman, I need to compartmentalize. 
 Hi, Shaun. 
 Nurse Hawks says girlfriends invite their boyfriends to get-togethers. 
 That means it's possible Carly did not invite me because I am not her boyfriend, but we make out and she wants to hold my hand and she lets me touch her breasts. 
 Those are things you do with a boyfriend. 
 Now all I think about is Carly, even when I'm supposed to be doing my job. 
 I do not like it. 
 I tried to talk to her, but I can't. 
 You can't talk to her? 
 I can't. 
 I need to compartmentalize. 
 Well, Shaun, you're you're very good at compartmentalizing. 
 Were you wearing your white lab coat when you tried to talk to her? 
 N-No, I was in my surgical scrubs. 
 Okay, see, we all struggle to to separate our work life with our personal life, right? 
 That's why we wear uniforms. 
 It tells us, it tells the world, ""This is what I have to focus on right now. 
 I can't worry about anything else. 
 "" - That makes sense. 
 - Good. 
 So, when Carly's wearing her white lab coat, then she's just a co-worker, not a girl you happen to be seeing at the moment. 
 When you're wearing your white lab coat, then you say to yourself, ""I'm a doctor, damn it. 
 I'm not gonna worry about everything else. 
 "" Say to yourself, ""I'm a doctor. 
 Romance doesn't matter. 
 "" I'm a doctor. 
 Romance doesn't matter. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 Romance doesn't matter. 
 I am a doctor. 
 Romance doesn't matter. 
 I am a doctor. 
 Romance doesn't matter. 
 Um, you're wearing a white lab coat. 
 You want to be a doctor and get the other bees out of my eye? 
 You make a fair point. 
 Looking for Murphy? 
 Yep. 
 - Blood tests being expedited? 
 - Yes. 
 Did you own your mistake or blame some innocent clerk? 
 How did it feel? 
 Is it eating at you? 
 You mean, how do I live one moment behaving how you do constantly? 
 At least I'm consistent, even when I'm going through my own issues. 
 Shaun? 
 Why aren't you wearing your white coat? 
 I am a civilian. 
 Medicine doesn't matter. 
 You're not leaving. 
 Your surgery is in six hours. 
 Did you speak to Carly? 
 I need to talk to Carly. 
 Shaun, why did we practice this morning? 
 Because I'm not good at communication. 
 Exactly. 
 But with practice, you can do it. 
 Talk to me. 
 Tell me the problem. 
 Tell me how you feel. 
 Okay. 
 I have to talk to Carly. 
 Shaun, stop. 
 You don't have to talk to Carly. 
 Everything is fine. 
 I talked to her earlier, and it was just all a misunderstanding. 
 Why did she not invite me over to meet her friends? 
 There were no friends. 
 Uh, the laughing you heard she thinks it must have been a podcast she was listening to. 
 I need to get my lab coat. 
 Told you you're better at this than I am. 
 Though you could have jumped in earlier. 
 We were able to do a biopsy, and the mass is non-malignant. 
 We've stabilized it, but it does still need to be removed. 
 When? 
 Two months. 
 By then, the baby will be viable outside the I don't feel well. 
 My vision's getting blurry. 
 Your blood pressure's tanking. 
 W Doctor, what's happening to her? 
 Page Dr. Melendez. 
 Hello. 
 My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy, surgical resident year 3. 
 I will be assisted by Dr. 
 Claire Browne on today's open appendectomy. 
 I will not be putting on my number 7 sterile gloves myself, as I am lead surgeon. 
 Nurse Fletch, can you adjust the overhead light? 
 Adjust to a 35-degree angle. 
 Nurse Hawks, please hand me the 10 blade. 
 The arterial embolization was rejected above the bladder. 
 The mass is seeping blood. 
 We have to go in again, or she'll slowly bleed to death. 
 We deliver the baby early, have an incubator and ventilator ready in the O. R. 
 Even with maximal NICU support, the baby's chance of survival is around 15% to 20%. 
 Maybe we were wrong the first time. 
 Maybe we can leave the child and work around her. 
 We can suction-resect this friable lesion and control the bleeding better with the argon beam coagulator. 
 Very easy to go too far, cause a uterine rupture. 
 But if we don't screw up, the baby gets to stay in the womb and grow to term. 
 Nice. 
 I'll go book an O. R. 
 Wait. 
 There's one more thing we need to do. 
 It's a good plan. 
 But the safest course of action is to deliver prematurely and remove the mass. 
 By ""deliver prematurely,"" you mean terminate the pregnancy. 
 Not necessarily. 
 But yes. 
 To save her life. 
 If I place internal iliac artery balloon catheters, I can control most bleeding as it happens. 
 Most? 
 I've performed surgeries that were a lot more complicated under much more difficult circumstances. 
 When you had no other option. 
 You have a choice here, a safer choice. 
 The mother's life takes precedence. 
 That's our policy. 
 Are we sure it's hers? 
 Okay. 
 Go make your case. 
 Thank you. 
 Neil? 
 Thank you for getting my approval. 
 It's your job. 
 I will now use electrocautery to incise through both the fascia and muscles. 
 Can I please get a measurement on the patient's pulse, blood pressure, and temperature? 
 Pulse is at 65, pressure 118/82, and temp is normal, at 98. 6 degrees. 
 Thank you for hearing and responding. 
 The appendix can be removed in various ways. 
 I will be using the suture ligation technique. 
 Dr. Browne, can you identify the ascending colon and its taenia coli? 
 I see it. 
 Thank you. 
 Please free the appendix-mesoappendix complex from its adjacent tissue. 
 Babcock clamps. 
 We must have nicked an ileocolic branch of the SMA. 
 Get suction on it, Dr. 
 Browne. 
 Nurse Fletch, please use lap sponges to stem the bleed. 
 If she hemorrhages, she could die? 
 That is a possibility. 
 But if you're successful, then I complete my pregnancy. 
 No. 
 It's too risky. 
 If Dr. 
 Melendez says he can do it Do the other surgery the one where you take the baby out and you save Patty. 
 I'm the one carrying the baby. 
 I'm the one going through the surgery. 
 It's not your choice to make. 
 I-I didn't want this baby. 
 Sorry. 
 I j Look, we can have another child some other time. 
 But I can't replace you. 
 I don't want another baby. 
 I want the one that's been giving me morning sickness for the last 23 weeks. 
 I want the one who's been giving me heartburn, constipation, and insomnia. 
 That's the baby that I want to hold. 
 And I couldn't live with the guilt if I k*lled our baby to save my own life. 
 Performing a suture ligation with two interrupted 2-0 vicryl sutures. 
 Dr. Browne, cauterize the exposed mucosa. 
 I may owe Dr. Lim an apology. 
 Continue. 
 Uh, yes. 
 We still need to copiously irrigate the wound with normal saline, grasp the peritoneum with two straight clamps, and close it all up with a continuous 3-0 vicryl stitch. 
 Irrigating. 
 Straight clamp, please, N-Nurse Straight clamp, please, Nurse Hawks. 
 You are handing them to me incorrectly. 
 I'm sorry? 
 You are handing them to me incorrectly. 
 This is how I always do it. 
 You do it wrong. 
 - Shaun - I don't know how else to do it. 
 You can do it the right way. 
 What's the right way? 
 - The efficient way. 
 - Efficient? 
 Yes. 
 There is historical precedence to my preference. 
 Please just take the clamp. 
 - I can't. 
 - Of course you can. 
 Take the damn clamp. 
 You need to leave. 
 Nurse Hawks you need to leave the O. R. 
 Leave now! 
 Dr. Reznick, please cauterize those bleeders with the argon coagulator. 
 I nicked an artery. 
 She's hemorrhaging! 
 Hang 4 units on the rapid infuser. 
 Get me a vascular clamp. 
 The surgery was successful. 
 The patient's vital signs are stable You can't solve your interpersonal problems by making people go away. 
 There was a bleed. 
 You threw the nurse out of surgery because of a bleed? 
 Yes. 
 Because we nicked the ileocolic branch of the SMA, Nurse Fletch was attending to the lap sponges, so Nurse Hawks had to hand me the straight clamp, and she did it wrong. 
 And she refused to do it right. 
 Did you tell her how to do it right? 
 I wanted my straight clamp handed to me at a 45-degree angle so I do not have to bend my wrist as much to go from handoff to the surgical field. 
 Did you explain all of that to her? 
 I told her to do it the efficient way. 
 I want you to apologize to Nurse Hawks. 
 N-No. 
 No. 
 Why would I apologize because she did not do it right? 
 Because you didn't, either. 
 When you're lead surgeon, it means you're in charge, which means if anything goes wrong, it's your fault. 
 Do you understand? 
 You've gotta make this right. 
 Okay. 
 You could have stepped in and kept the situation from escalating. 
 You have your way of dealing with Shaun, and so do I. 
 We need better control of the bleeding. 
 Clamp off the common iliac. 
 There's too much blood to see in here. 
 We have to take the baby out. 
 Page the on-call neonatologist. 
 Let them know they're gonna have a 23-week-old girl coming their way very soon. 
 Second time in as many days you've dropped by unexpectedly. 
 I'm starting to think you like me. 
 I got a job offer. 
 Well, there you go. 
 That was quick. 
 Let's go celebrate. 
 Well, I'm not gonna take the offer. 
 I want to come work here with you. 
 Well, we've already talked about that. 
 You talked. 
 I listened. 
 Now it's my turn to talk. 
 We got married to be here for each other, even when the other one didn't know they need it. 
 You're so busy with your patients, you don't see that the clinic is starting to suffer. 
 Right now, it's double-booked appointments. 
 Next, it could be the wrong medication prescribed. 
 I would never let that happen. 
 I'm a good partner. 
 I'm good at home, on the weekends. 
 I could be equally as good here in this office. 
 Okay, if it doesn't work out, I'll quit. 
 Or you can fire me. 
 No harm, no foul. 
 Uh, nothing is ever as simple as ""No harm, no foul. 
 "" Got a rÃ©sumÃ©? 
 Well, I was hoping to avoid that. 
 Mm. 
 I read a study that said sharing a cup of coffee with colleagues promotes professionalism. 
 My cup is empty because I do not like the way coffee makes me feel. 
 I've had a long day. 
 Can I just enjoy my lunch? 
 Chief Lim asked me to apologize to you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 The earliest known drawing of a pivoting surgical instrument dates back to 1500 B. C. on a tomb at Thebes, Egypt This does not sound like the beginning of an apology. 
 I want to explain why I prefer the straight clamp handed to me at a 45-degree angle. 
 Putting it in historical context will help. 
 You need to stop. 
 In the ninth century, Albucasis, known as ""the father of surgery"" You need to go away. 
 No. 
 I need you to understand because if you see why I'm right, you will see there is no reason for me to apologize. 
 She's gone into unstable v-tach. 
 Dr. Reznick, we're gonna need the defibrillator.

 All you had to do was say you're sorry. 
 I tried to explain why the straight clamp N-No, I-I don't hear the word ""sorry"" in there. 
 I-I don't hear any taking of responsibility. 
 You said I had to make this right. 
 An apology seemed to be just one possible way Shaun, she filed a complaint. 
 - No. 
 No! 
 - Yes. 
 Yes. 
 - You have a problem with communication. 
 - I was Yes, but I am So I'm going to make this very, very clear. 
 You screwed up. 
 - No. 
 - Yes. 
 Yeah, you were wrong. 
 - No! 
 - You are wrong. 
 You screwed up. 
 This incident will be noted in your file. 
 And if this or anything like this happens again, that will be the end of your residency. 
 Now, what do you have to say? 
 You're sorry? 
 I failed. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Good. 
 Now go say those words to Nurse Hawks. 
 And mean them. 
 I spoke to Carly. 
 You're a terrible fairy godmother. 
 You swoop in, you enchant the hero with a lie, and then you carry on like you made his world a better place. 
 Shaun was about to talk to Carly. 
 That's what he needed to do. 
 I think Carly's pissed at him. 
 Fine. 
 Then she's pissed at him. 
 They deal with it. 
 Shaun's problem is communication. 
 You made it worse. 
 Shaun needed to get his head straight before his first solo surgery. 
 That is what I did. 
 I fixed the problem. 
 You buried a problem. 
 Which seems to be your general approach to life right now. 
 Hey, Shaun. 
 Hello. 
 We need to talk. 
 You're mad at me. 
 Yes. 
 Because whenever you have a problem, I hear it from Glassman or Claire or Morgan anyone but you. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Good. 
 Shaun, stop! 
 This is the problem. 
 You have to tell me what's bothering you. 
 Why did you not invite me to your get-together last Sunday? 
 I had some old friends over. 
 We were gonna drink and play a little poker. 
 My friends are snarky. 
 They tease and play practical jokes on each other. 
 And I knew that you wouldn't like that and that it would get weird, so I decided not to invite you. 
 That's it. 
 The whole story. 
 My father always sent me to my room when he would play poker with his friends. 
 They were loud, and they would tease me. 
 They said I talked funny. 
 Is that what your friends were going to say? 
 No, Shaun. 
 Of course not. 
 Then what were they going to do? 
 Nothing, I guess. 
 It's just sometimes when you bring the guy that you're dating into the mix, that relationship changes. 
 It can be a disaster. 
 Was it a disaster every time you brought a date to meet your friends? 
 No. 
 Some fit right in. 
 Then how did you know? 
 How did you know it would be a disaster with me? 
 I didn't. 
 I made an assumption. 
 And I shouldn't have done that. 
 I'm sorry, too. 
 Can you forgive me? 
 I wasn't a great girlfriend. 
 Girlfriend? 
 You're my girlfriend? 
 Yeah. 
 Does that mean I'm your boyfriend? 
 You are. 
 I forgive you. 
 Can I kiss you? 
 Okay. 
 I'm glad we talked. 
 Me too. 
 I'll introduce you to my friends next week. 
 No, thank you. 
 I would not like to meet your friends. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay."

 Exactly the same.

 You can learn a lot from percolators.

 She says she's gonna bring her own spin to it.

 He was Roman, that's why I'm doing the accent.

 Anyhoo, Jesus answered, and I think it might have gone something like this. 
 (IMITATING JACKIE MASON): I'm not a king, I'm a carpenter. 
 A Jewish carpenter. 
 The only thing I nail are my SATs. 
 So then, Pontius says to the elders, ""This-a Jesus, he-a look like a nice-a guy. 
 "" Nobody talk-a like-a that. 
 I make a nice-a sentence. 
 Just like-a Mama used to construct. 
 - Oh - Can we just hear Lovejoy's sermon, please? 
 Yeah, Marge, read the room. 
 Mm You need this more than we do, lady. 
 Boring. 
 That's what this straight-A Girl Scout has become boring.

 (SCREAMING) 
 (GASPS) 
 You just had a near-death experience. 
 That's exciting.

 I'm going to bed. 
 That will really turn around your boring reputation.

 Don't worry, Homer, I'll chop the wood.

 I have to do everything.

 - Whoa! 
 - Hyah!

 Hmm. 
 Thanks, um Paula. 
 Friend of Patty's. 
 We met at Burning Woman. 
 Nice job on that wood. 
 HOMER (WEAKLY): I helped. 
 Yeah, you helped, all right. 
 You helped that hammock kiss the ground.

 Marge, I don't know if you know this, but I'm a top-level contender at Timbersports. 
 That's so interesting. 
 How does it feel to be magnificent? 
 I'll show you. 
 The only card I need is the ace of spades The ace of spades. 
 (CHAIN SAW BUZZING)

 It's an unpaid passion that you do in your spare time. 
 Now, we're going to the woods. 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 Ah. 
 - What are you doing? 
 - Breathing. 
 Breathing for the first time in my life. 
 Ah. 
 Can I do one thing for the knots in your shoulders? 
 Sure. 
 Aah Ooh, ooh! 
 Ooh! 
 Not so Oh. 
 Now, to motivate your chopping, think of things that make you mad. 
 Oh, nothing really makes me mad. 
 Mom, Lisa won't stay on her side of the thought bubble. 
 (BOTH GRUNTING) 
 You have five seconds to live.

 So do you, idiot. 
 We're in the same bubble.

 She's a natural.

 She made a friend. 
 You've made me a new woman.

 It's no weirder than that time our knees touched under the bar. 
 You still think about that? 
 Every day.

 Aw. 
 I haven't been this happy in a long time. 
 You were great, but I have a question. 
 Do you want to take it to the next level? 
 What do you mean? 
 Will you ride the blade with me? 
 You know, help me bow the jagged-toothed fiddle? 
 I don't understand. 
 Draw and drag the sequoia widow-maker.

 Will you be my partner on the double-ended bucksaw?

 I know you do. 
 But if we do this, you'll have to train with me for a month, in Portland. 
 A month?

 You are, honey. 
 In a way I could never make you feel or comprehend. 
 Paula wants me to train with her. 
 If I do, I'll be gone for a month. 
 A month? 
 We've never been apart that long. 
 I miss you when we're separated in a revolving door. 
 I miss you when I'm putting a sweater over my head. 
 I miss you when I close my eyes during a sneeze. 
 I miss you when the clock springs ahead an hour. 
 We'll never get that time back. 
 Homer, do you really want me to stay, knowing how much I need this to feel good about myself? 
 Yes, I do. 
 - (GRUMBLES) 
 - What? 
 What? 
 Where you going? 
 She might leave and never come back. 
 Just like the McRib.

 We were, of course, unraveling.

 - Now where's the baby? 
 Aw. 
 Good girl. 
 Um, I like what you're wearing. 
 Thank you. 
 These are locally-sourced dungarees and Pendleton flannel. 
 It's what Jill Sobule wore when she played the Crystal Ballroom. 
 (GASPS) 
 Jill Sobule? 
 Like every other place we go, I love Portland. 
 So much, I want to leave Springfield until I find out something bad that makes me realize that there's no place like home. 
 Now, now, your mother has not settled in here. 
 PAULA: Welcome. 
 These are our pugs: Nike and Swoosh. 
 BOTH: Mwah. 
 Marjorie, could you and I have a word in the backyard? 
 Don't you see what's happening here? 
 - You're married. 
 - Yes, I know. 
 - To you. 
 - No, to her. 
 Look around. 
 You're married in the two most important ways there are: emotionally and cooking. 
 (CHUCKLES): Oh. 
 That's ridiculous. 
 (QUIETLY): You're fostering pugs. 
 - They remind me of you. 
 - Aw. 
 But I am upset. 
 I'm finally good at something and you have to be jealous. 
 Marge, sweetie, I'm really proud of you. 
 I'm not jealous or mad. 
 It's just when are you coming home? 
 Tomorrow, after the competition. 
 Woo-hoo! 
 I win. 
 - Not that I was nervous. 
 - (PHONE VIBRATING) 
 Unless we win, in which case, I might stay and prep for the finals. 
 Marge, I've backed you in this from day one. 
 No, you haven't. 
 Not a bit. 
 Then it's too late to start now. 
 Oh, I'm sitting in a bar and my wife's in love with a female lumberjack. 
 Classic Portland. 
 Where are you from? 
 Springfield. 
 - Which one? 
 Oregon? 
 - I don't know. 
 ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to the Grizzly Timbersports Northwest Championship Finals, brought to you by no one. 
 Still looking. 
 Marge and Paula are in control. 
 I am falling in love with this sport. 
 And when I fall, I fall hard. 
 I'm taking you home with me.

 Hold the Stella, fella. 
 Carol ""Oak"" Connor and Rachel ""The Pine"" Cohen have taken command. 
 I can't be silent anymore. 
 Let me through. 
 - Eh. 
 - There's plenty of room. 
 - Marge, I was a lumber-jerk. 
 - (GRUNTING) 
 I'm only happy if you're happy. 
 Our love is like an old tree. 
 If you cut it down, it grows back stronger. 
 (QUIETLY): Um, that's not how trees work. 
 Well, according to my book, it is. 
 (GRUNTING) 
 - Yay! 
 All right. 
 - (CHEERING) 
 I love this sport! 
 And maybe now I can love my lumberjack son.

 - All right, champ! 
 See you in the showers. 
 Congratulations, Paula. 
 You won. 
 Enjoy the hell out of her. 
 Homer, what is it you think that I've won? 
 With me, Marge is a good woman. 
 With you, Marge is a great woman with two awesome dogs. 
 I'm not interested in Marge. 
 - I have a wife and a kid. 
 - You have a wife? 
 She's in Tokyo, training for the Olympics. 
 She dances with the ribbons? 
 I don't know what it's called. 
 So you're not breaking us up? 
 No. 
 I mean, I'll miss her on the other end of the bucksaw, and I'll really miss that $80 grand prize money, but she's welcome to come up here and train any time. 
 I am so grateful. 
 I want to do something for you. 
 If you'd like another kid, I am more than happy to offer up my sperm. 
 That's very kind, but No really, I've always wanted to have a kid with no responsibilities. 
 All right. 
 You're in the top three. 
 It's you, the track star or the Harvard professor. 
 Oh, I get it. 
 Instead of sperm, would you like semen? 
 - They're the same thing. 
 - They are? 
 Uh-oh. 
 Oh, it still feels weird. 
 I don't know what to say to her. 
 (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY) 
 I never would've thought of that. 
 Honey, would you like to come home? 
 Aw. 
 Okay. 
 Your daddy loves you, sweetie. 
 He wants to make sure you're always a strong, confident little lady. 
 So I went out and got you this. 
 Mwah. 
 (BUZZES) 
 Aw, her baby head fell out. 
 You'll be getting a visit from the Head Fairy. 
 I walked out of the forest Before we said goodbye The birds were all a-singing As she pointed to the sky She said, ""Can't you see the rainbow? 
 They made it just for you"" She handed me her toolbox Said, ""Now you know what to do"" Vroom, vroom, pull the cord Buzz, buzz, just one more Roar, roar, what a thrill With Lumberjill Vroom, vroom, pull the cord Buzz, buzz, just one more Roar, roar, what a thrill With Lumberjill."

 I'm sorry. 
 You didn't return my calls this weekend. 
 After a ride up Skyline Boulevard, 60 minutes of Muay Thai, and a 15-year reserve Scotch, I had a moment of clarity. 
 What you said about my objectivity in the Fields case wasn't about me. 
 You were in pain. 
 I was taking responsibility. 
 And asking you to take your share. 
 It was a good surgical plan. 
 You need to accept that, despite being a gifted surgeon, you are fallible. 
 I think I should run my procedures by Glassman from now on. 
 Audrey, we need some checks and balances. 
 I am checked and balanced. 
 And I'm the chief of this department. 
 You will continue to run your medical decisions past me. 
 ANDREWS: Browne, you're with Melendez today. 
 Murphy and Park, meet me in the E. R. observation unit in 20. 
 I thought I was on E. R. consults with Park today. 
 If I'm being bumped because I took off the other day, Dr. 
 Browne was every bit of First lead surgery. 
 Thank you. 
 Scheduled for tomorrow. 
 Study the images and prep your patient. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Yes! 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I rock, I rock! 
 The surgery gods know it, I know it, and apparently, so does Andrews. 
 Boasting doesn't have the same impact when you're picked last. 
 He was obviously waiting for the right case to come along. 
 No. 
 You're kidding me. 
 This is much better than my first surgery. 
 Damn right. 
 A med student could do an appy. 
 The carotid endarterectomy takes serious finesse. 
 Fair to say it's really a 5th-year procedure, but I don't have time to sit around debating semantics. 
 I have the Holy Grail of resident surgeries to prep for. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 The tumor was found on my left lung at my medical fitness exam. 
 Tricky spot. 
 Curable, but tough to remove without taking the entire lung. 
 That's what they said. 
 And you didn't like that answer? 
 I need my lung. 
 I'm going to the moon. 
 ANDREWS: When did the chest pain start? 
 Around 9:00 this morning. 
 Okay, I'm gonna look at your heart. 
 This gel may be a little cold. 
 You see a cardiologist. 
 Did you use the nitro he prescribed? 
 It usually relieves the angina, but not this time. 
 Are you the same Rosalind Elion who just published a study on IDH2 Inhibitors in Myeloid Leukemia in the Journal of Pediatric Oncology? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Wow. 
 You're famous. 
 W I-I used an IDH2 on a kid with AML. 
 - I mean, he's doing great. 
 - Oh. 
 Your studies revolutionized leukemia treatment. 
 It's an honor to meet you.

 All my friends had Spock ears. 
 I was all about McCoy. 
 [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
 There's our tumor. 
 It's embedded in the hilum. 
 NASA doctor was right. 
 We'd have to take the entire lung to get it out. 
 Not necessarily. 
 The tumor's grown into the upper lobe. 
 If we can remove it from the main bronchus, we can get a clean margin. 
 The rest of the lung can stay. 
 No-go. 
 You'd have 80% of your If treatment reduces my lung volume at all, I'll be unfit for space travel.

 Major blood vessels, your airway, esophagus, and heart are right there.

 Thank you for your time.

 What do you see at the apex? 
 I see perfusion abnormalities. 
 Her LAD and PD are completely occluded. 
 She listed her husband as her medical proxy. 
 You'll need to update him as soon as he gets here. 
 The entire left side of her heart is compromised. 
 He's not coming. 
 They've been divorced for two years. 
 He hasn't spoken to her in almost that long. 
 Murphy, anastomose the internal mammary to the LAD. 
 Let's see if we can give her heart a blood supply. 
 I tracked down her sister in Santa Cruz. 
 She hasn't seen Rosalind in years, either. 
 That's a lot of legwork for a surgeon no social worker available? 
 It's good that you didn't find anyone. 
 Family members are the least qualified people in the room to make medical decisions. 
 Judging by the state of her myocardium, there's only one choice, anyway. 
 She needs a new heart. 
 I think it's possible to spare her upper lobe using a surgical robot. 
 Wren Braxton came to see me. 
 You're her second opinion? 
 Or fourth or whatever she's up to? 
 I'm surprised you didn't offer the robotic option. 
 It's the type of surgery I usually send your way. 
 I didn't offer it because with the robot, if I nicked her pulmonary artery, she'd likely bleed out before I have a chance to open her up to control it. 
 She's just gonna keep looking until someone gives her the answer she wants. 
 And then what? 
 What do you think her odds of survival are if some hack tries to cut the tumor out, leaving the lungs intact? 
 Roughly zero. 
 I agree. 
 And with you? 
 With the robot? 
 Still lousy. 
 You can do this. 
 You're overestimating the risk, and I know why. 
 And you're doing exactly what you did last time. 
 Assuming that I can do anything. 
 So everyone else is biased except for you? 
 The one who just had a patient die on him? 
 If it's had any effect, it's to make my judgment more acute. 
 I won't risk having Wren leave here the same way that Patty Fields did. 
 People risk things to make their dreams come true. 
 If you don't want to help her, I'll do it myself. 
 PARK: The intra-aortic balloon pump will support your heart until we find a donor. 
 And when might that be? 
 SHAUN: A heart is the most difficult organ to procure. 
 But since yours is so badly damaged, you are very high on the list. 
 I suppose that's a good thing. 
 Not really. 
 The We're doing everything we can. 
 Thank you. 
 PARK: Is there anyone you want us to call? 
 Yes.

 Hannah needs to stay with the cultures around the clock. 
 [GROANS LIGHTLY] 
 I don't want five years of work to go to waste. 
 Can I ask why you listed your ex-husband as your medical proxy? 
 I had to name someone. 
 Leo is the only person I ever discussed my medical issues with. 
 Now, if you don't mind, I have a lot of work to do, which, as you've indicated, I may not have a lot of time to do it.

 How are you, Shaun? 
 These are STAT cardiac labs. 
 I have to go. 
 I hope you're not embarrassed about last night. 
 I want to have sex with you. 
 That's nice. 
 I think about it very often. 
 Even when I'm supposed to focus on more pressing matters. 
 Like 15 minutes ago when I was filling out that lab requisition, I almost forgot to add a BNP. 
 That's good. 
 No, it's not. 
 We need a BNP to monitor her cardiac function on the balloon pump. 
 I've been thinking about you, too. 
 Sometimes when I shouldn't. 
 - That's bad. 
 - Not really. 
 I've been doing some research. 
 I came across this therapy psychologists use to treat phobias. 
 Apparently, it works in people with autism, too.

 MORGAN: I need a different first surgery. 
 There a problem with your patient? 
 The plaque dissection is too advanced for a third-year resident. 
 I was nervous as hell for my first surgery. 
 And it was only a tonsillectomy. 
 I could take out a pair of tonsils blindfolded. 
 It's not nerves. 
 This is more like a fifth-year procedure. 
 You're setting me up to fail. 
 This is why I picked you. 
 You come to me scared, and you couch it in arrogance. 
 It's rare that a resident has what you have the aggressiveness, the work ethic, and talent to be a leader. 
 I'm not setting you up to fail. 
 I'm setting you up to shine. 
 Or am I wrong about you? 
 No, sir.

 I want you to do my surgery. 
 The one Dr. 
 Lim suggested. 
 It was Dr. 
 Lim's idea. 
 She's an excellent surgeon and my superior. 
 And you think I'm an idiot. 
 I am afraid of this surgery. 
 And I'm afraid of going to the moon. 
 It's not about the moon. 
 It's about the fear. 
 It's about getting beyond that. 
 That's how great things happen how they've always happened because someone took a chance. 
 From what I've read about you, you're exactly the kind of person I need in my corner. 
 Exactly the kind of person I would've thought would understand. 
 Fear is also what keeps us alive. 
 [SIGHS] 
 What do you think the odds are of you not coming back from the moon? 
 The reason it's heroic, the reason it's exciting is because you don't know what to expect. 
 You can't anticipate everything. 
 1%, 2%, maybe 5%. 
 60%. 
 This surgery, if I were doing it, there is a 60% chance that you die on the table. 
 It's called exposure therapy. 
 We'll lie down on the bed side-by-side, fully clothed and not touching for 15 seconds. 
 When this timer goes off, you'll go into the other room for a three-minute break, and then we'll go again for 20 seconds. 
 Over time, we will progress to longer intervals and start to lie closer together. 
 This seems like a good approach.

 I lasted eight seconds.

 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 First time is difficult. 
 I'm sure she didn't We tried timed exposure therapy to get physically closer, but I couldn't do it. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 So try something else. 
 When I lie close to her, I feel diaphoretic, my heart rate is elevated, and mouth gets dry. 
 I don't know how to not feel that way. 
 You want this, Shaun? 
 Yes. 
 Very much. 
 Then rely on your strengths. 
 Treat it like a surgical problem.

 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Give me some good news. 
 I had a potential donor in San Diego, but the heart was just too damaged. 
 I'm at the GE junction now. 
 Now she has complete right-sided failure, too. 
 It's time to discuss a DNR. 
 She's got one day left in this world. 
 Let's keep her comfortable. 
 60%? 
 That number is grossly exaggerated. 
 I spent an hour convincing my patient I'm not trying to k*ll her. 
 She came to me. 
 I gave her my surgical opinion. 
 I I could fire you for this. 
 Because I contradicted your opinion after you contradicted my opinion? 
 I gave her an option you were too afraid to present. 
 No, you proposed a potentially deadly surgery to a woman who was desperate for any option, no matter how crazy.

 I wouldn't want to be kept alive on life support. 
 Not if there was no hope for a recovery. 
 There wouldn't be. 
 As your heart failure worsens, you may get short of breath from fluid build-up. 
 We can use diuretics and vasodilators to help control that. 
 I recommend both of those. 
 Of course. 
 Yes. 
 If that doesn't help, we could insert a catheter in your chest to drain the fluid. 
 The procedure does risk a lung puncture, which would worsen your symptoms. 
 You should give us every option to keep you breathing easy. 
 And we'll be on call all night to make sure you're as comfortable as possible.

 I went through this with my mom when she was dying of leukemia. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Was that recent? 
 I was 10. 
 I remember feeling so helpless You should reach out to Leo. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 It's too late. 
 I don't believe that. 
 There were, uh, things between my wife and I that I thought we could never get past. 
 But last Christmas we almost lost our son. 
 And when I reached out, Mia was there. 
 Leo always made me feel pressured to choose between my research and him. 
 Eventually, I realized he was right. 
 So I chose to go - where I was needed the most. 
 To call him now would be hypocritical and unfair. 
 It took a lot of time and dedication to push our understanding of leukemia as far as you did. 
 I'm glad I have treatment options for my patients. 
 You made a good choice. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Sorry to keep you waiting. 
 I assume that some of this is professional, the other 90% is personal. 
 Am I right? 
 Well, it's a very difficult case. 
 We're both just overly invested. 
 Actually, I'd love for you to weigh in on this one. 
 Dr. 
 Lim, are you confident in the surgical plan? 
 - Good luck. 
 - Thank you. 
 You didn't even look at the case. 
 - The pulmonary - Dr. 
 Lim is my Chief of Surgery. 
 I trust her judgment. 
 I'm sorry things got out of hand. 
 It won't happen again. 
 It better not happen again. 
 If you two can't control your interpersonal squabblings, I'm gonna have to lose one of you at least. 
 We need an endoscopy suite to fetch the spoon out of this guy's stomach. 
 Cool. 
 How's the intimacy research going? 
 Dr. 
 Elion has had a very successful life without a relationship. 
 So can I. 
 Success and happiness aren't the same thing. 
 You need to decide what will make you happy in the end. 
 I don't know if it's being a great surgeon or being close to Carly. 
 But I'm better at surgery than I am with her. 
 Dr. 
 Elion is wrong. 
 You don't have to choose. 
 I fly to Phoenix every other weekend to spend time with Mia and Kellan. 
 Then you won't be great at either. 
 I think Dr. 
 Elion is afraid. 
 I think it was never about the journals and the lives she could save. 
 I think she's always been afraid afraid she might lose Leo just like she lost her mother. 
 And you, you lost the person you loved the most when your brother died. 
 Your elevated heart rate, sweaty palms they're not about your sensory issues, Shaun. 
 It's what we all feel fear. 
 W-Why would anyone want to feel afraid? 
 Because the thought of ending up alone is scarier. 
 I don't think Dr. 
 Elion refuses to call Leo because it's hypocritical. 
 I think she's afraid he won't come. 
 Can you handle the spoon? 
 Yes.

 I need cortisone sh*ts. 
 Surgery's in two hours. 
 Can I ask you something? 
 If a patient say, a violinist who concertized three or four times a week were to come to you with achy joints, would you give them a cortisone shot or tell them to lay off for a while?

 started it. 
 Okay. 
 You're gonna have to postpone your first lead surgery for a while, see how you respond. 
 I-I'd have to explain why to Andrews and Lim. 
 As you should. 
 A cortisone shot is just a temporary fix. 
 Do you know what the chances are the D-MARD can maintain the dexterity you need to perform an operation in the long run? 
 45%. 
 I-It'll change the way they see me. 
 Yeah, you have a condition a medical condition. 
 They'll expect less from me. 
 They'll be looking for me to fail. 
 Th That's why I'm confiding in you instead of them. 
 You advocated for Shaun when everybody else thought he couldn't be a surgeon. 
 I'm sorry, you're comparing arthritis to autism? 
 I'm comparing people's assumptions, people's prejudices. 
 I'm asking for a chance to prove myself. 
 In this surgery today, you're gonna have to create a plane as thin as paper between two delicate layers of tissue without disrupting the major blood flow to the brain. 
 If you miss by 1/10th 1/10th of a millimeter, the patient will suffer permanent brain damage or worse. 
 Right now, it's a matter of pain, not function. 
 You think I would put a patient's life at risk? 
 That's insulting. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Without the pain, I can do this.

 Her bladder is distended. 
 Whatever it's pressing against must be causing these att*cks. 
 CT shows she has two pelvic lesions, and labs show elevated levels of catecholamines. 
 The pain meds we gave her could have distended her bladder, which is abutting one of the tumors, setting off her second attack. 
 But what set off the first one? 
 Sexual intercourse. 
 The other tumor appears to be within her clitoris. 
 Progressive impact may have destabilized it over time. 
 And now she's at risk of having more seizures. 
 Sex could k*ll this woman. 
 He's stable, and the MDMA is out of his system. 
 We're good to go back in and graft the aorta. 
 We're just getting caught up with blood loss and fluid resuscitation. 
 An endovascular stent is minimally invasive. 
 It is a better option than a graft. 
 But a stent could clot off because we won't be able to give blood thinners. 
 His liver is still a bleeding risk. 
 Let's take our chances with the stent. 
 We can be in and out and have him back in the ICU, where we can focus on his recovery. 
 I do not want to proceed without consent. 
 He won't regain consciousness for another couple of hours. 
 We shouldn't wait that long.

 It won't affect your uterus or ovaries. 
 What about sex? 
 You won't be able to have intercourse or experience an orgasm. 
 I-It doesn't make sense. 
 I've been sexually active for five years. 
 Never had any att*cks. 
 We suspect the tumor's been dormant for some time. 
 What if I don't have the surgery? 
 What are the odds of another attack? 
 There are many variables involved, including frequency, duration, sexual position, penis size About 2%. 
 Each time? 
 Each time. 
 On average, couples have sex 52 times per year, which means in the next three years, your chance of having a life-threatening attack is well over 95%. 
 I think we'll take our chances. 
 You should talk it over between yourselves, perhaps with a counselor I understand the situation. 
 I don't want the surgery. 
 I'll catch up. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. 
 Missed you at the research meeting. 
 I was in surgery. 
 Craniotomy. 
 Now I have two consults, a meeting with a donor, and a hospital chair meeting. 
 Well, don't forget to eat something. 
 Ah, food is for the weak. 
 So is waiting for this elevator. 
 Are we okay? 
 Yeah. 
 Sorry, I'm just busy. 
 We're recommending the stent. 
 It risks clotting, but it's also less invasive than the graft. 
 The graft would be a more permanent repair, but there's greater chance of surgical complications. 
 I have to trust you, right? 
 Is Dad gonna be okay? 
 Oh, absolutely, darling. 
 We're gonna take good care of your dad. 
 He'll be home before you know it, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Thank you. 
 If we send her home without the surgery, she'll die. 
 We don't know that. 
 And taking away sex from a young couple in love? 
 That's devastating. 
 So's death. 
 How much time does a couple actually spend having sex? 
 19 minutes per week, including foreplay. 
 The rest that's the real relationship. 
 Forget the act itself. 
 Sex is crucial to the happiness and satisfaction of a relationship. 
 Sex is destructive. 
 It turns people into liars and cheaters and idiots. 
 It might start relationships, but more often than not, it rips them apart. 
 She got devastating news and made an emotional decision without thinking it through. 
 The least we can do is get her counseling. 
 Was she offered counseling when you gave her the diagnosis? 
 Briefly, but she was still reeling from the Then it's over. 
 When she's stable, discharge her. 
 Thank you. 
 Yeah, the pink heart and purple star How are you feeling? 
 Hi, Doctor. 
 He's doing great. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Dr. Browne. 
 You had a tear in your aorta, but we stabilized it with a stent. 
 Until we can give you blood thinners, you'll be at risk of a clot, so we'll be monitoring you closely. 
 But right now, everything is looking absolutely perfect. 
 Oh! 
 Gentle. 
 See, Cupcake? 
 It's all good. 
 Why didn't you come home last night? 
 Daddy had a sleepover at Uncle Jeff's. 
 He got a new turtle. 
 You can see it next time. 
 Your blood pressure is responding well to the alpha-blockers. 
 We'll run labs. 
 If they're normal, you can be discharged in the morning. 
 Thank you. 
 You'll want to be aware at all times of where the closest hospital is. 
 Every time you have intercourse, you'll be endangering your fiancÃ©e's life. 
 I-I'm aware of that. 
 We both are. 
 But it's Jeanie's body. 
 It's her decision. 
 I'm just trying to be supportive. 
 I don't think you are. 
 You're being selfish. 
 She's risking her life, and you're keeping your mouth shut so you can keep getting laid. 
 You do think I'm making the right decision? 
 Yes. 
 I do. 
 Thanks. 
 He really is gonna be fine. 
 I know. 
 Thank you. 
 You okay? 
 I think he's cheating on me. 
 His brother lives in Willow Glen, the other side of the city from where he had his accident. 
 What did he say about it? 
 That he had a breakfast meeting with a client. 
 Not unlike the excuse he used last time he cheated. 
 Him denying it was the worst part. 
 Made me doubt myself. 
 You know, was I just a paranoid, jealous wife, throwing out wild accusations? 
 Your husband has just had a serious car accident, and you're very stressed. 
 Right now, all you should be thinking about is getting him better. 
 You're right. 
 Thank you. 
 Not at all. 
 Would you like to take my top off? 
 Yes. 
 Would you like me to take your shirt off? 
 No. 
 I would like to do it myself. 
 Even better. 
 Okay. 
 I've got it. 
 - I-I got it. 
 - Okay. 
 Mm. 
 Do you want to slow down? 
 Do you want to stop? 
 I'd like to go watch some TV. 
 So, eh, you weren't feeling it? 
 I was definitely feeling it. 
 She Mm. 
 I don't know. 
 I think you're confused. 
 I think I think it's emotional and it's hormonal, and and and maybe I wasn't confused. 
 She had a tattoo. 
 It was half a heart. 
 I don't understand why someone would get an incomplete tattoo. 
 She shouldn't have something that's incomplete on her body that I can see. 
 You sure it was the tattoo? 
 Yes. 
 It is a very disturbing tattoo that makes no sense. 
 Maybe it's not about the tattoo. 
 I mean maybe it's about intimacy? 
 Letting another person into your life that's a big deal. 
 I know. 
 Trust me. 
 There are gonna be things about her that you love and things about her that you don't. 
 And there are certain things, like the tattoo, you you can't change. 
 Because because well, it's worth it. 
 She can get the tattoo removed. 
 She can't get the tattoo removed, Shaun. 
 I don't think it's about the tattoo. 
 We are backed up. 
 Sorry, Shaun. 
 Okay. 
 Everything looks good. 
 Could've just checked them on the E. M. R. 
 I know. 
 How's it going with Shaun? 
 He tends to overshare with coworkers. 
 Yes, he does. 
 And he was oversharing up until this morning, so I'm guessing the Night of a Thousand Stars didn't go as planned? 
 We're fine, thanks. 
 Of course. 
 You waited three weeks for a kiss. 
 You're a saint. 
 That didn't sound like a compliment. 
 I like Shaun, and I love that he's dating, but I can't help thinking that the kind of person who'd go out with Shaun might be seeing him more as a project than a person. 
 And I'd rather not see him get his heart broken. 
 Last week, two techs called in sick. 
 I had to diagnose and file over 200 slides. 
 But when I told Shaun, he came down and he helped me get through them until 3:00 in the morning. 
 I am not going out with Shaun because I have a martyr complex. 
 I'm going out with him 'cause he's a great guy who treats me well. 
 And the condescending notion that someone needs an ulterior motive to be interested in him means you're the one who isn't seeing him as a person. 
 Your craniotomy ended an hour before the research meeting. 
 You didn't miss the meeting 'cause you were in surgery. 
 I think you missed the meeting because I was gonna be there. 
 I'm busy. 
 I can show you my calendar if you'd like. 
 You dumped me. 
 I should be the one avoiding you. 
 What's going on? 
 Are you having second thoughts? 
 No. 
 I'm not. 
 Why are you willing to die for sex? 
 Sex creates vulnerability, lets you be open, honest with each other, share your biggest fears. 
 Sometimes, you shouldn't share. 
 Sometimes, you have to just accept, right? 
 Wrong. 
 What you have to accept, that's not for anyone else to say. 
 If you don't tell your partner everything that you're feeling, thinking, worrying about, then you aren't fully connected. 
 Close your eyes. 
 Yes, this is one of those dumb sensory exercises, but just go with it. 
 Now tell me one of your favorite memories with your fiancÃ©e. 
 Last summer, we went camping in Yosemite. 
 We decided to rough it by only packing PB&J sandwiches. 
 The first night, a bear rips into our tent and devours them. 
 And the next night, of course, we had this hole in our tent, and the mosquitos just ate us alive. 
 And the bug spray that we thought we packed? 
 It was sunscreen. 
 And then when it started pouring, we turned to each other at the same time and we said, ""Denny's. "" And that's when I knew I wanted to marry her. 
 Great. 
 That was a memory of something you got through together, not about the time you had a threesome in Miami. 
 It was New Orleans. 
 The threesome was in New Orleans, not Miami. 
 And it was way better than the bear trip. 
 But I wasn't gonna tell my fiancÃ©e's doctor about it. 
 Sex makes you real with someone. 
 Sex makes you stupid. 
 I had the perfect man. 
 He was smart and funny. 
 He squeezed the sponge after washing the dishes. 
 Then one night, I-I met some guy and I had a few drinks, and, um I got all tingly and got really stupid. 
 Never saw him again. 
 Or my boyfriend. 
 Sex can make us feel incredibly close to someone honest, vulnerable. 
 But sex is not the goal. 
 All the rest of those things are. 
 She's the love of my life. 
 And I always thought that we were strong and that we can overcome anything together. 
 But without sex I don't know if if we have enough. 
 Okay. 
 Then you need to lie to her. 
 Nurse said you'd be here an hour ago. 
 Yeah, well, you're not my only patient. 
 Look, I get it. 
 This is about as awkward as it gets. 
 Yes, it is. 
 You know, I almost died in that accident. 
 When I woke up, all I could think about was my wife and my little girl and how much of an ass I'd been and how hurt they'd be. 
 So, why is it that once I get out of here, I'm gonna keep cheating on them? 
 I can't help it. 
 No matter how much remorse or guilt I feel like I always give in. 
 Then you should leave them. 
 I can't. 
 I love them. 
 How messed up is that, right? 
 But I think you know. 
 Yeah, well, I don't cheat. 
 I saw you checking me out in the bar. 
 My left hand, just making sure I was married. 
 You're just as big a cheater as me, Dr. 
 Browne. 
 My, uh, leg it's it's cold. 
 No pulse. 
 Your stent has formed a clot. 
 We need an angio, stat! 
 Everything okay? 
 You haven't said a word since ""Pass the salt. "" It's about Shaun, isn't it? 
 Two weeks ago, you asked me to give him romantic advice, which I didn't want to do. 
 And then he comes into my office for romantic advice, and you kick him right out. 
 It's because you're helping him too much. 
 He is completely dependent on you. 
 For good reason. 
 He hasn't spoken to his parents since he was 14. 
 The only person he cared about died right in front of his eyes. 
 Aaron, I know how much you love him. 
 How you hate to see him struggle, fail, get hurt. 
 But you need to let him. 
 And he'll be okay. 
 Because he has someone else in his life now. 
 Just like you do. 
 Placing guide wire through the needle. 
 Placing catheter. 
 So, how do you know this guy? 
 You knew he was on MDMA, you've been avoiding him since he arrived, and I checked on his accident. 
 It was a half mile from your place. 
 I was with him the night before the accident, but it's not relevant. 
 It hasn't affected my judgement. 
 Yes, it has. 
 If you hadn't been avoiding him, we could've caught the clot earlier. 
 I figure you've been going through something lately. 
 Something that's really hurt you. 
 And maybe it's making you turn to things you normally wouldn't. 
 But some of the guys you meet are gonna be trouble, some are gonna be married, some are gonna He took a vow, not me. 
 That's the exact attitude someone had when they helped ruin my life. 
 There's the clot. 
 Activating angio jet. 
 It's too big to bust. 
 We have to open him up. 
 You said to accept things I don't like, but Jeanie said - I have to share everything, - Shaun. 
 Shaun. 
 And I don't know Shaun, stop, stop, stop. 
 I have to go home. 
 I can walk you to your car. 
 Is it very far? 
 I think this discussion will take at least 15 minutes, so maybe you can drive me? 
 We have to set boundaries, okay? 
 We have to set some limits. 
 You can't just come over 6:30 in the morning, uh, uh, for flower advice. 
 You can't just pop into my office anytime you want. 
 Is this because of Debbie? 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 And I agree with her. 
 It was different when it was just the two of us, but now we have people in our lives both of us. 
 We have to make them the priority. 
 Does this mean we can't talk anymore? 
 No, of course we can talk. 
 Of It's just that there's a time and a place for everything. 
 And this is the wrong time and place? 
 Yeah. 
 7:00 a. m. Tuesday. 
 Pancakes. 
 I liked it better when it was just the two of us. 
 125 over 78. 
 Looks good. 
 Nice bug spray. 
 SPF 50. 
 Not much went right that trip. 
 But the more things went wrong, the closer I felt to you. 
 We'll get through this, too. 
 I don't know. 
 Sex has always been our language. 
 Our way of sharing who we are with each other. 
 And if we lose that what if we don't have enough? 
 We'll still have honesty, intimacy, love, three kids. 
 Two boys and a girl. 
 I love you more than sex. 
 I love you more than sex, too. 
 Does this mean you're getting the surgery? 
 Yeah. 
 90 minutes without a pulse in his leg. 
 He's at high risk for necrosis. 
 Prosthetic successfully sutured to aorta. 
 Almost done with the distal right anastomosis. 
 Careful not to narrow the artery during suturing. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Blood flow restored. 
 Good arterial pulse. 
 Good job catching that clot, Dr. 
 Browne. 
 If we'd waited any longer, we'd have to amputate. 
 Thank you. 
 It was a team effort. 
 Making incision at the vaginal wall. 
 Murphy, develop margins at the lesion. 
 Forceps. 
 Nicely done. 
 How you turned your patient around. 
 It was nice when Tony told Jeanie he loved her more than sex. 
 He was lying. 
 I told him that if he cared about her at all, he had to. 
 Maybe it was the truth. 
 It can be true without him knowing it's true. 
 What's wrong? 
 Dr. Glassman told me I have to accept things, but Jeanie said to be open and honest. 
 I agree with Jeanie whoever she is. 
 It's your tattoo. 
 Thank God. 
 I thought you hated my boobs or something. 
 It's incomplete. 
 Didn't you have enough money to pay for a full heart? 
 I got this in high school. 
 It's incomplete. 
 Not anymore. 
 I got you. 
 Shaun? 
 Dr. Glassman was right. 
 It's not the tattoo. 
 We were able to restore blood flow to his legs. 
 He's gonna be just fine. 
 Thank you so much, Dr. 
 Browne. 
 Now that he's out of the woods, you don't need to feel guilty about questioning him. 
 All the pain, paranoia, and self-doubt you deserve to know the truth. 
 He's just gonna deny it. 
 Then you need to insist. 
 Our relationship was a stupid idea. 
 Which made ending it a smart idea. 
 Simple, binary and naive. 
 I really underestimated how hard this would be. 
 Yes, I've been having second thoughts. 
 I'm not saying we should get back together What are you saying? 
 I don't know. 
 Good. 
 It's good to know that it's not easy. 
 It's good to know that it mattered. 
 Intimacy isn't about a tattoo. 
 And it's not about touching or kissing or even sex. 
 It's about sharing your biggest fears. 
 Yes. 
 What are you scared of? 
 I love being a pathologist. 
 But every day I walk into the lab, I am filled with doubt. 
 Am I smart enough? 
 Am I capable enough? 
 Do I really deserve to be here? 
 How long until someone walks in and exposes my fraud and has me removed from the premises? 
 Eventually, those thoughts retreat. 
 Until the next morning, when they all come crashing back into my brain. 
 That and pigeons. 
 They freak me out. 
 Hmm. 
 My biggest fear is that I'll be alone. 
 If I don't get over this, you'll leave. 
 We don't have to have sex. 
 Can we just hold each other for a little bit? 
 I think I'd like that. 
 Shaun? 
 Sash Sash! 
 You should go. 
 I don't know. 
 Maybe. 
 It can wait till tomorrow morning. 
 Eh, you were right. 
 Everything you said was right. 
 But this is different. 
 Shaun needs you. 
 Hey.

 Your dad's been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
 He may only have a few days left."
gdoc_3_10,6470478,3,10,"GLASSMAN: Shaun, you need to make a decision. 
 Shaun, please. 
 Your mom's been calling. 
 Your father wants to talk to you. 
 Say something, will you? 
 Say anything. 
 I know he wasn't a good father, but he's the only father you've got. 
 If ever there was something you wanted to say to him, now's the time. 
 I have nothing to say to him. 
 Okay. 
 But if he wants to say something to me before he dies, I'll listen. 
 Okay. 
 - Can you come with me? 
 - Yeah, of course. 
 Can I bring a friend? 
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 I want to bring a friend. 
 Shaun, how how long have you been dating Carly? 
 I don't want to bring Carly. 
 I want to bring Lea. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO]

 Never seen you here before.

 Yeah. 
 Um About last night.

 You know, you don't have to go if you don't want to. 
 I can handle it. 
 I don't want to go. 
 I obviously have no wisdom to offer my own family's a disaster. 
 And things are crazy-busy at work now. 
 Okay. 
 But he's my best friend, and he seems to need my support, so there's no way I'm gonna say no. 
 Well, don't force yourself to go if you don't want to. 
 Sounds like you don't want me to go. 
 It's just that it's it's gonna be intense, it's gonna be emotional. 
 Really? 
 I thought going home to visit the parents who abused and abandoned him would be a fun family reunion. 
 Why are you getting defensive? 
 Why do you have to be controlling? 
 - How am I controlling? 
 - Hmm. 
 - I'm just ask - I'm ready to go. 
 We have to be at the airport 90 minutes prior to our flight. 
 Can you believe the size of this guy? 
 PARK: Exactly why I don't watch football. 
 Size is more important than talent or skill. 
 I'm gonna guess you never played. 
 Half the players are morbidly obese. 
 Yet they can still run 4. 
 9 forties and have 36-inch verticals. 
 It doesn't matter what kind of body you're born with. 
 No one makes it to the top unless they're incredibly talented and they worked their ass off. 
 It's just stupid. 
 Jocks get paid millions and get treated like royalty, whereas people who do jobs that actually matter teachers, cops, doctors [SCOFFS] 
 we can barely pay our student loans.

 This is bad. 
 Burst and facet fractures T3 and 4. 
 Retropulsion of bony fragments in the spinal canal. 
 But look here. 
 There's no transectional bruising in his spinal cord. 
 SHAUN: We're in boarding group A, right? 
 Boarding group A, no emergency exit row, right side of the plane. 
 Have you spoken to Carly? 
 Not since last night. 
 Well, don't you think you should call her, let her know where you're going and why and with whom? 
 She won't worry. 
 She knows I don't like my dad, so I won't be sad when he dies. 
 Shaun call her and let her know that you're you're gonna miss her. 
 She must know I'll miss her. 
 Tell her anyway. 
 - [TRUNK LID CLOSES] 
 - You know it must be good advice if he and I actually agree. 
 If we can stabilize the fractures and decompress the cord, we should be able to reverse the paralysis. 
 Fantastic. 
 We should start a preoperative Riluzole regimen. 
 No. 
 There's an experimental hypothermia treatment shown to reduce cord edema and cell death when done prior to surgery. 
 It's also shown a high rate of bradycardia and arrhythmias, which is the last thing I want to deal with during surgery. 
 There's an infusion protocol we can follow to reduce that risk. 
 The faster we reduce the inflammation Thank you, I appreciate your input, but as Art's surgeon She's right. 
 And what makes you think you're doing the surgery? 
 Dr. 
 Melendez, I appreciate all you've done. 
 But now that he's stable, my staff will take over. 
 Well, actually, that's not your call. 
 Or mine. 
 You're a pro athlete with a pro athlete's body. 
 And you need a surgeon who understands that this is not just about making sure you can walk again. 
 It's about making sure you can run, block, so you can get back out on that field and play at the top of your game. 
 This is what I do. 
 Sure, you do knees, you do shoulders. 
 Have you ever done anything like this before? 
 Robert Stokes, last year. 
 Donny Lund a few years before that. 
 Both players had similar spinal fractures. 
 Actually, not that similar. 
 This is more like what I see in high-speed motorcycle accidents. 
 And unfortunately, I've seen a lot of those. 
 Not one or two every few years, but 20 to 30 every year. 
 That's what I do. 
 [SIGHS] 
 This is gonna be awesome. 
 Have you got something to say? 
 I get you want to deal with stuff on your own, for people to mind their own business. 
 But whatever pressure you've been feeling is still here.

 Just because your dad's dying doesn't mean he deserves to be forgiven.

 You had time to text me. 
 I wasn't sure what to say.

 But a part of you had to understand that ignoring me would be hurtful. 
 I'm not sure what to say now.

 Mm. 
 She thinks I, uh I might have PTSD. 
 Sounds a bit excessive. 
 You've definitely dealt with some childhood trauma. 
 You think she's right? 
 I think doctors make the worst patients. 
 Mm. 
 The best patients are the ones who ask a lot of questions. 
 And keep an open mind. 
 We gave him the laxatives, and right away, he tried to leave. 
 Ended up passing out and vomiting. 
 I'm fine.

 We need to get him to Radiology. 
 We need an abdominal CT stat. 
 No.

 Painful constipation, nervous agitation, refusing scans You're obviously packing dr*gs. 
 The balloons have either created a complete obstruction or one of them burst. 
 Please, I just want to go home. 
 Luca, we're doctors, not cops. 
 He definitely sounds like a cop. 
 We won't call the police, I promise. 
 Whatever is wrong, let us help you. 
 How's Carly? 
 She wasn't upset about you ghosting her while you were with Lea in Wyoming? 
 She said it was hurtful. 
 You got off easy. 
 Is this your weird way of breaking up with Carly to get with Lea? 
 I don't want to break up with Carly. 
 But you do want to get with Lea. 
 I didn't say that. 
 Not out loud. 
 And you're making a big mistake. 
 Carly's smart. 
 Pretty. 
 And the fact that she's willing to dea I with all your stuff means you should be thanking whatever God you pray to that you ever met her. 
 While Lea is Well, a flake. 
 She's not a flake. 
 She showed up on your doorstep without even giving you a heads-up that she was coming back to San Jose. 
 Then she needed to move out, but then she moves in. 
 Not to mention the whole ""Let's get drunk on tequila and I'll teach you how to kiss, ""but I just want to be friends"" nonsense. 
 She's not a flake. 
 There is traumatic avulsion of the ligaments. 
 She's going to need surgery. 
 We hammer a long rod through the medullary canal to hold the two ends of the break together. 
 It's a broken leg. 
 Can't you just put a cast on it or something? 
 Obviously, you'll be asleep. 
 You won't feel anything. 
 I lied. 
 About the Vicodin making me sick. 
 My husband doesn't know. 
 I'm an opioid addict. 
 I've been clean for 10 years, but one dose could send me right back. 
 Do whatever you need to do to fix my leg, but you can't use any narcotics. 
 Not even an epidural? 
 Strongest thing she'll let us give her is Tylenol. 
 Ketamine? 
 What about Ketamine? 
 It's non-narcotic and can create a dissociative effect. 
 It's mind altering and potentially addictive. 
 Hypnosis has been shown to be effective. 
 Only when used in conjunction with narcotics. 
 Studies say playing the patient's favorite music can help manage pain in certain surgeries. 
 Yeah, we hammer a nine-inch rod through her tibia, but she's okay because she's listening to the soundtrack from Hamilton. 
 I said ""certain surgeries. 
 "" Okay. 
 That's the answer. 
 Music? 
 A different surgery. 
 Some other way of putting her leg back together. 
 An external fixation. 
 We put two pins through the proximal tibia. 
 Another two in the distal end of the bone beyond the fractures. 
 Healing will take much longer, and there's an increased risk of infection and permanent deformity and And small pins are much less painful than a huge nail. 
 I'll get her prepped. 
 I got laid off. 
 I needed money, and this was just a one-time thing. 
 But it was a mistake. 
 It was a stupid mistake. 
 This works best if you don't talk. 
 Our plan is to attach a metal frame with pins into your leg. 
 It'll stabilize the fractures, and we can do it without narcotic anesthesia. 
 I know she's worried about an allergic reaction, but aren't there any other dr*gs you can use? 
 Given your wife's medical history, this is the best strategy. 
 Don't worry, sweetie. 
 Remember I'm strong like Wonder Woman. 
 There's over 50 latex balloons lodged near the ileocecal junction. 
 They'll need to be surgically removed. 
 And we need to alert San Jose Vice/Narcotics. 
 No. 
 The only reason he agreed to treatment is because we promised we wouldn't do that. 
 I didn't promise that. 
 Neither did Dr. 
 Melendez. 
 We don't call the police on overdose victims or addicts. 
 He's got probably two kilos of what I'm sure is heroin in his gut. 
 He's not an addict. 
 He's a dealer. 
 I know you feel for this guy. 
 But hospital policy is clear. 
 Take a few more of those deep breaths for us. 
 Just two more to go. 
 Kerry, we need you to somehow keep your leg still. 
 B. P. is 190/110. 
 Push I. V. beta blockers. 
 - Wait, no! 
 - No, they're not narcotics. 
 We just need to give you something to reduce the pressure. 
 Back to 150/80. 
 - Kerry, how are we doing? 
 - Better. 
 We'll get this last one in, and you'll be good to go. 
 No. 
 You promised me. 
 Yeah. 
 You value honesty and morality over all else. 
 If you leave this hospital now, you will die. 
 I'll take my chances. 
 You know what'll happen when one those balloons bursts? 
 You'll start feeling weak, get cold. 
 Soon you'll have secretions filling your lungs and airway. 
 You'll try to scream for help, but nothing will come out. 
 Can you get the release paperwork? 
 I'll be back in a few minutes. 
 Luca, I understand where you're coming from. 
 You're a doctor. 
 Last job I had, I was a busboy. 
 I grew up in a trailer. 
 A bunch of 'em, actually. 
 My mother wasn't the type to save for a rainy day. 
 But we never gave up. 
 Even when you think you're alone, you're not. 
 I want to help you. 
 You just have to give me a little more time. 
 One hour. 
 If I can't figure out how to treat you and keep you out of jail, you can walk out the door. 
 You'll have some discomfort for the next few weeks, but all you need right now is rest, and you should be able - Mommy! 
 - Hey. 
 Oh, my gosh, that's so cool. 
 Everyone says their spouse is the strongest person they know. 
 But I have actual proof now. 
 Told you. 
 Wonder Woman. 
 This is absurd. 
 If this was a tumor, we'd take it out and toss it. 
 This time, it just happens to be dr*gs. 
 Yeah, because cancer is not a felony. 
 You can't just toss out the dr*gs with the medical waste. 
 He's not a gangster or a hardened criminal. 
 He's just He's just a scared guy trying to survive. 
 You're assuming anything he's told you is true. 
 And even if it is, not everyone who needs money becomes a drug mule. 
 You can't imagine what it's like to grow up in that kind of poverty. 
 Shouldn't you be judging this guy the harshest? 
 You made it out just fine without breaking the law. 
 That's not exactly true. 
 My mother used to go on these trips. 
 I would come home from school, and she'd be gone. 
 Sometimes hours, sometimes days. 
 I didn't have any money. 
 So when I needed supplies and food from the store, I would sneak them away in a backpack. 
 One day, the bag broke and all of the soup and oatmeal that I had stolen fell out right in front of a security guard. 
 And she looked at me, at my face, at my clothes, and then she helped me pick them up and let me go with a warning. 
 If she hadn't given me a break, I wouldn't be standing here, as a doctor, discussing this with you. 
 Maybe there's a way to save Luca without ruining his life or breaking policy. 
 Shaun. 
 You need the elevator. 
 Use the elevator. 
 What am I doing wrong? 
 I never know where I stand with you. 
 One minute, we're sharing deep, personal fears with each other, and the next, you're running away because you can't stand to touch me. 
 Be honest Is there anything going on with Lea that you're not telling me? 
 Say something, Shaun. 
 It's different. 
 I like you, Carly. 
 When I'm around you, I want to be impressive to you. 
 I don't feel like I have to impress Lea like I do you. 
 We will have to keep whatever medical waste we collect during your surgery in the lab for testing. 
 But we will discharge you before the pathology report comes back. 
 At which point we'll be obligated to alert the police. 
 How do I know you're not gonna call the cops right after you put me to sleep? 
 You'd be a moron not to trust Dr. 
 Browne at this point. 
 She's gone way beyond the call to save your ass. 
 Okay. 
 Say thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Dr. Murphy. 
 How about you head home for the night? 
 We still need to monitor Kerry. 
 And it's easier for me to avoid Carly here than it is for me to avoid Lea at home. 
 Okay, I'm only gonna respond to the first objection. 
 You've had a long week, and it's important you get some rest. 
 Morgan will take point. 
 How did you know your wife was the right woman for you? 
 Personal advice? 
 I thought that was Dr. Glassman's domain. 
 Dr. Glassman is divorced. 
 He seems happy with his marriage now, but I have no way of knowing for sure. 
 You're better than him. 
 For this. 
 I knew I wanted to be with Isabel the first time we spoke. 
 Freshman-year biology class. 
 And I have not wavered in that resolve in the 27 years since. 
 But How did you know? 
 It was a feeling I had in the pit of my stomach every time I was around her. 
 I felt Nervous? 
 Excited. 
 It's a cliche, but my heart sped up every time I saw her. 
 Still does. 
 Not quite in the same way, but Now, if you don't mind, I need to get home to that woman. 
 Hey, you. 
 How was the first day back? 
 Confusing. 
 Problem with a patient or Carly? 
 If you don't want to talk about it, we can just hang. 
 Let's just hang. 
 Copy that. 
 Commencing a hang. 
 Um, Sh Shaun? 
 Hm. 
 What's up? 
 This will just take a few seconds. 
 Hello? 
 It didn't work. 
 Kerry's leg is swelling up. 
 I think she has compartment syndrome. 
 You need to get back here. 
 We'll have to do the surgery we've been trying to avoid. 
 We'll first have to make multiple incisions to relieve the pressure and then replace the external frame with an internal nail. 
 If we don't act soon, you could be facing an amputation. 
 Okay. 
 You'll need to be sedated. 
 No. 
 Look, I can take it. 
 Kerry, you had a blood-pressure spike during the fixation procedure. 
 Without anesthesia, you could have a hypertensive crisis, a risk of stroke, or heart attack. 
 Post-op, we can help you manage the dosing. 
 And if you relapse, we have counselors that No. 
 I remember waking up all those mornings cold and alone, wondering if I could ever be happy again, if I deserved to be happy. 
 Any amount of pain is better than losing everything again. 
 My husband, my daughter How long can you keep secrets from the people you love before they stop being the people you love? 
 Every relationship has secrets. 
 This, it doesn't have to be one of them. 
 Drug addiction is a disease. 
 You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 It happens because of the choices you make. 
 When you have lost everything, but you still manage to find someone who makes you want to get up and live another day, you do whatever you can to hold on to them, even if it means burying a piece of yourself in the process. 
 If we can't convince her to change her mind, maybe her husband can. 
 Impracticality isn't cause for breaking doctor-patient confidentiality. 
 This isn't impractical. 
 It's irrational and barbaric. 
 We're not permitted to reveal any secrets to the husband. 
 But we can tell him that. 
 Last one. 
 What's wrong? 
 It's too adherent to the intestinal wall. 
 Could use Potts Scissors to dissect it free. 
 Let's give it a try. 
 Nurse? 
 Your idea. 
 Only fair you do the honors. 
 Check it for perforations. 
 It's intact. 
 Vitals are stable. 
 Take the specimen container to the lab. 
 Dr. 
 Browne, you're leading closure. 
 There's been some complications. 
 We need to perform an additional surgery. 
 What do you need to do? 
 I can't tell you. 
 I'm unable to go into further detail. 
 It would violate your wife's confidentiality. 
 Confidentiality? 
 Haven't you been telling me everything? 
 Again, I'm unable to go into further detail. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 What's going on? 
 Why can't the doctors talk to me? 
 Kerry, obviously, there's something going on you don't want me to know. 
 Are you dying? 
 No. 
 No. 
 It's It's nothing like that. 
 Hey. 
 Then what? 
 Whatever it is, I want to be able to help. 
 Please. 
 I'm an opioid addict. 
 I've been clean for a decade, but That's why I never take painkillers. 
 And that's why I can't let them use anesthesia. 
 Why didn't you ever tell me? 
 You don't know the kind of person that I was. 
 Who the dr*gs turned me into. 
 I tried quitting so many times, but it never stuck. 
 Until you. 
 Meeting you saved me. 
 But if I relapse, I know I'll drive you away. 
 Hey, hey. 
 How could you ever think I'll stop loving you? 
 The woman who knows the lyrics to every Boyz II Men song? 
 The woman who rushes home to watch those stupid home-makeover shows live. 
 The woman I'm raising our daughter with. 
 The woman who will steal from you, the woman who will lie to you, - who will hurt you - No. 
 the woman you won't be able to trust. 
 No. 
 Just do what the doctors tell you. 
 Take the meds. 
 I will be there for you. 
 No matter what happens. 
 I love you. 
 And I know you mean that. 
 But I'm not as strong as you think I am. 
 - Baby. 
 - I just can't. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 We'll start prepping you for surgery. 
 I like your laugh. 
 I like your smile. 
 I don't usually look at eyes, but I think yours are pretty. 
 I like your breasts. 
 You can keep going if you want to. 
 I like spending time with you. 
 I like that you are kind. 
 I like that you are patient. 
 I like that you're my girlfriend. 
 Are you going to break up with me? 
 No, I am not planning on breaking up with you. 
 We had a fight. 
 Couples fight. 
 But I'm worried, Shaun. 
 I'm flattered that you want to impress me, but that is not worth anything if you feel like you can't talk to me. 
 Hm. 
 You're right. 
 I have to tell you. 
 Everything. 
 I got very upset in Wyoming. 
 Lea came in to comfort me and we hugged and laid down on the bed, and we fell asleep hugging. 
 That's everything that happened. 
 We struggled with lying together for weeks. 
 And you Did it in one night with Lea? 
 Yes. 
 But sh She's a close friend, and she wanted to be there for me. 
 Please, just stop talking. 
 Shaun, I-I just I need some space. 
 I can't be around you right now. 
 Shaun? 
 I wanted to be honest. 
 Carly said she wanted me to talk to her. 
 Lea said not to tell what happened. 
 Lea was right. 
 Uh, take a breath. 
 Sit down. 
 I can't. 
 I have surgery in a few minutes and I can't focus and And I feel sick, and is everyone going to leave me? 
 What? 
 What? 
 What are you talking about? 
 My dad didn't want me. 
 My mom chose him over me. 
 Carly now hates me. 
 - Shaun. 
 Shaun. 
 - Lea will get tired of me. 
 - Shaun. 
 - You'll get sick of me. 
 - I do everything wrong. 
 - What? 
 - Shaun, Shaun, look at me for a second. 
 - Everyone will go away! 
 - I make people upset! 
 - Hey, hey, Shaun! 
 - Oh, my God, Shaun! 
 - I make them angry! 
 I make them hate me! 
 Shaun, look at me, look at me, look at me right here. 
 Right here. 
 Look at me here. 
 Don't ever say that about yourself. 
 Don't ever say that! 
 You hear me? 
 You're gonna get through this. 
 You're gonna go to surgery, and you're gonna get this done. 
 - How? 
 - How? 
 Because you're an extraordinary doctor. 
 That's how. 
 And that's what you do. 
 That's what you do. 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 I could not be more proud of you. 
 You hear that? 
 And I could never get sick of you. 
 You're not getting rid of me, pal, okay? 
 I'm right here. 
 Right Right here. 
 Okay? 
 I got you. 
 I'm going to be late to surgery. 
 Can you let me go now? 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Numbing cream applied. 
 Are you ready? 
 We were able to remove all the balloons. 
 So you should be out of here in 24 hours. 
 It'll likely take another 48 hours to get the contents tested. 
 The lab's very busy. 
 I know I've been a pain in the ass. 
 I've just gotten used to people screwing me over. 
 You're the first person that's made me feel, I don't know, seen. 
 Maybe one day, I'll find a way to pay it forward, right? 
 Reamer's in the intramedullary canal. 
 This will make space for inserting the nail. 
 You're doing great, Kerry. 
 Inserting into canal. 
 Here comes the nail. 
 You ready? 
 - B. P. 's spiking. 
 - Push beta blockers. 
 Hang in there. 
 220/170. 
 She's having a tachyarrhythmia. 
 Screw it. 
 We have to push the fentanyl. 
 Nurse, help Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 No. 
 It's helping distract her. 
 You sure, Dr. Murphy? 
 Yes. 
 Please hurry. 
 It was a good day. 
 It must be very gratifying, saving lives. 
 Yeah, I think I might've done a little more than that today. 
 I I think I might have changed one. 
 Last time we met, you mentioned that your mother would frequently berate you when you were young. 
 What kind of things would she say? 
 Do we have to get into that right now? 
 Can't I just have a good day? 
 You know, enjoy feeling okay for once? 
 Claire, I believe you've fallen into destructive patterns precisely to avoid confronting your feelings about your mother, her death. 
 Feelings that need to be confronted if you hope to get better. 
 Uh Cardiac care nurse to E. R. 
 Cardiac care nurse to E. R. 
 They're reviewing the security video. 
 Someone faked a seizure, staff responded, and another person broke into the storage locker. 
 Do you think Luca The only thing missing was his specimen. 
 Is someone questioning him? 
 Luca's gone. 
 What will the police do? 
 Nothing. 
 All we have is a fake name and the knowledge that someone stole some balloons with unknown content. 
 She definitely is a Wonder Woman. 
 You were right the first time. 
 She's totally irrational. 
 Needlessly endangered her life. 
 But I understand why. 
 My mother used to say I'd end up like her Putting my faith in the wrong people, getting taken advantage of. 
 That no one would ever truly love me except her. 
 There are worse qualities in this world than trying to see the best in people. 
 If you're a good person, every now and again, you're gonna feel like an idiot. 
 Today you were wrong. 
 And I am still grateful that I work with you. 
 Thank you. 
 Have you had enough space yet? 
 Shaun, do you remember the first time we met? 
 I was checking on a biopsy to see if the tumor margins were in the artery walls. 
 Yeah. 
 And you said if I didn't do it right then, you would toss a rock through my window. 
 Yes. 
 I thought it was cute how much you cared. 
 And when you started working in Path, I realized, ""This guy may be the most genuine person I have ever known. 
 "" You told me the truth. 
 That is a good thing. 
 That's why I like you. 
 That's why I don't want to lose what we have. 
 You hurt me. 
 And I worry something like that could happen again. 
 I want to be with you, Shaun. 
 But I don't know how this works if you're still living with Lea. 
 You Want me not to live with Lea? 
 I know that's a lot to ask. 
 And if it's too much I understand. 
 You don't have to answer right away. 
 Take some time. 
 Okay. 
 Okay? 
 I want to be with you. 
 I love you, Carly."
gdoc_3_12,6470478,3,12,"Those are yours. 
 We bought them together. 
 Because you ""found the pattern soothing. 
 "" I'm gonna miss you, Shaun. 
 I love Carly. 
 And that's great. 
 I am so happy for you. 
 Now you can hang the toilet paper incorrectly anytime you want. 
 And Carly and I can go back to the way things were before our fight. 
 Well, sometimes couples need a little time to recover. 
 We won't. 
 Carly asked for you to move out. 
 You are moving out. 
 How many kidneys do I need in my body to attend prom? 
 Ryan Even if the surgery removes my kidney, it'll be laparoscopic, so my inpatient time will be seven days, tops. 
 And then three more days of rest at home. 
 I can take my girlfriend to prom, right? 
 That's not a purely medical decision. 
 I have to draw some blood. 
 What are the chances Dr. 
 Melendez might be able to remove the tumor but spare Ryan's kidney? 
 Well, the MRI will let us know how much the chemo shrunk the tumor, but you shouldn't count on it. 
 One chili burger, extra mustard, extra pickles. 
 Hi. 
 Morning, Mr. Cooper. 
 I'm not sure he can have that with his surgery Oh, he's fine until about 6:30 tonight. 
 I know you. 
 Angie Valens. 
 I helped put in your chemo port. 
 I owe you a big thank-you. 
 We met in chemo. 
 They should put us in a public service announcement or something. 
 Yeah ""I lost a tumor and gained a boyfriend. 
 Thanks, chemo. 
 "" James McDougall? 
 That's who we're here for, too. 
 All of you can head over to Bay 4. 
 Guy saw me six months ago for a stress fracture. 
 He's a lunatic ultra-marathoner. 
 I just hope he didn't go too hard too soon and break it again. 
 He didn't break it again. 
 Your GP was right to start you on ketoprofen for the swelling, but clearly, it isn't working. 
 That's why Drs. 
 Murphy and Reznick are going to block off some of your lymphatic channels. 
 It should reduce production. 
 The more pressing concern is why. 
 Have you ever had surgery on your lymph nodes? 
 What about cancer or radiation treatment? 
 No. 
 Physically, I've always been healthy. 
 Physically? 
 I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder when I was 16. 
 That's why you got to get me back out on the road, Doc. 
 Are antidepressants not effective for you? 
 I mean, they help. 
 But running really is key. 
 Saved my marriage and And my life. 
 Lymphedema can be caused by an infection. 
 He doesn't have a fever. 
 Ketoprofen can suppress fevers. 
 Let's get some cultures and start him on broad-spec antibiotics. 
 As requested, your restock on enemas. 
 Nice cover. 
 How've you been feeling? 
 The methotrexate is working great. 
 No pain, no redness. 
 Stiffness, flu-like symptoms? 
 No. 
 All good. 
 How long are you planning to hide out doing RA exams and clipping diabetics' toenails? 
 Dizziness, headaches, nausea? 
 I Sometimes I'm a little queasy after I eat. 
 You had to love neurosurgery. 
 How about we try to get you a medication that doesn't irritate your stomach? 
 No. 
 My hands feel great. 
 That's all I care about. 
 You used to open up skulls and poke around people's brains. 
 There's no way this fulfills you. 
 I enjoy it. 
 Or, rather, I usually enjoy it. 
 I'll let you get back to it. 
 Maybe someone out there needs an enema. 
 Got a measurement on the Wilms tumor? 
 Mm, not quite there yet. 
 You mentioned 7 centimeters as our limit to doing this laparoscopically. 
 What if we pushed it to 7. 
 2? 
 Would speed up recovery. 
 By a few days. 
 Forget I brought it up. 
 Ryan wanting to take his girlfriend to prom should not factor into our surgical plan. 
 Is he nuts about her? 
 Ohh. 
 Crazy, head over heels in love. 
 They both are. 
 Idiots. 
 I wouldn't mind being an idiot like that again. 
 Though, I'm not sure I ever felt that way, totally happy. 
 So therapy's going well? 
 No metastasis in the lungs. 
 Look at that. 
 Your tumor is gone. 
 Gone? 
 How's that possible? 
 The chemotherapy worked better than we expected. 
 Wait, like, no tumor? 
 Zero? 
 - No need for surgery whatsoever? 
 - That is right. 
 These are discharge forms. 
 Both of my kidneys are taking you to prom! 
 Aah! 
 Hell, yeah, we are! 
 Angie? 
 - Angie! 
 - She's having a seizure! 
 2 milligrams of lorazepam and portable oxygen, stat. 
 Let's get that under her head. 
 His lungs are filled with fluid. 
 I need a chest X-ray and a bedside ultrasound. 
 And page Dr. 
 Reznick. 
 Imaging has confirmed a reoccurrence of your brain tumor. 
 What stage? 
 Three. 
 The best approach is surgery, a wide resection of the tumor, followed by radiation and chemo to encourage full remission. 
 Sounds like a fun couple months. 
 Full recovery will probably take closer to eight. 
 We can get through this, baby, just like last time. 
 W-When will the surgery be? 
 We need to do some additional imaging, and I'd like to consult a colleague about the best surgical approach. 
 That'll take a few days. 
 Take your time. 
 Prom? 
 Yeah. 
 Now that Ryan can go, I have to go. 
 Honey. 
 This is your health we're talking about. 
 Mom, please. 
 I just want to do this one thing like a normal kid. 
 Can you tell her it's okay? 
 We can't. 
 Until we remove your tumor, you're at risk of potentially fatal seizures. 
 After you're recovered, you and Ryan can get all dressed up, and we'll go have dinner at the Grandview. 
 Okay? 
 Prom sucks. 
 My buddy had a fake ID. 
 I got so drunk in the limo that I passed out and never made it into the dance. 
 Maybe that wasn't everybody's experience. 
 I was prom king. 
 My date was queen. 
 I had the dress, I had the date, I had the mom who got arrested. 
 Spent the night picking her up from the drunk t*nk. 
 Did you see Park while you were there? 
 Go to scheduling, get Angie's surgery set for Friday with the best neurosurgery OR nurses. 
 Let's go see Glassman. 
 Now I'm identifying the submillimeter lymphatic vessels. 
 I need an 11-0 micro suture and a 70 micron needle. 
 Instead of harvesting nodes to this area, could we redirect lymphatics away from his lymph system? 
 We could. 
 If you identify an appropriate vessel, you can make the connection. 
 We're clearly not dealing with an infection. 
 There must be a blockage somewhere in his lymph system. 
 Most likely cancer. 
 His CBC didn't show any abnormal cells. 
 Lymphoma doesn't always show up. 
 We need to run cytology on his lymphatic fluid. 
 It's either gonna be nasty or very nasty, depending upon how it attaches to the thalamus and fornix. 
 Which no imaging or testing can possibly determine. 
 So, our options are? 
 Between an endoscopic approach or an open anterior one. 
 That is correct. 
 I'd run a stereotactic MRI with fiducials and DTI to gauge how close the white matter tracts actually are. 
 You should scrub in. 
 Another doctor can cover the clinic. 
 I haven't been in an OR in over a year, and then, as a patient. 
 I'm not asking you to cut. 
 But it'd be a huge value to have you there. 
 I appreciate that. 
 I'll consider it. 
 Hello. 
 We need to run cytology on this lymphatic fluid. 
 I would be happy to. 
 Lea moved out this morning. 
 - Thank you. 
 - You're welcome. 
 Can you come over tonight? 
 Uh, that probably won't work Or we could go to your apartment? 
 I can't. 
 Lea said that it might take time for us to recover from our fight. 
 But I told her that we were okay. 
 We are. 
 I made plans tonight. 
 To hang out with a friend who just got fired. 
 But I would love to come over tomorrow night. 
 Okay. 
 I'll put a rush on this test, too. 
 Your lymphovenous anastomosis technique I was impressed. 
 It's a little early in the morning to be sucking up, Reznick. 
 Not for me. 
 I like to get a jump on things. 
 I'm fascinated by the way you use plastic procedures, like microsurgery, in other surgical specialties. 
 I thought it might make an interesting topic for a paper. 
 Want to write it with me? 
 Yes. 
 Let's talk and eat. 
 That's not breakfast. 
 I'm buying. 
 What publications do you want to target? 
 Last time, Angie had bad post-op vomiting. 
 - Of course. 
 I'll make note of it - Excuse me. 
 She's asleep. 
 She needs her rest. 
 I'll wait out here until she's awake. 
 Ryan, your immune system is weak. 
 It would be so easy for you to pick up a bug and pass it to Angie. 
 I haven't been around anyone but my dad. 
 I swear. 
 He could wear a mask. 
 After Angie's surgery, we'll see about arranging a visit. 
 Please tell her Ryan came by. 
 I'm sorry if I overstepped. 
 I'd like to change Angie's status to ""No visitors"" on her chart. 
 Yeah. 
 Please take Mr. 
 McDougall to his room. 
 I'll be there in a moment. 
 Is that James McDougall? 
 - And the woman with him? 
 - His wife. 
 Is it cancer? 
 No Worse. 
 His lymphedema is caused by a genetic mutation. 
 If you don't find a medication he responds to, he'll drown from the inside. 
 The mutation is on James' ARAF gene It makes an enzyme called kinase, which can cause cells to overproliferate. 
 It's a genetic condition. 
 What set it off now? 
 Probably the stress fracture. 
 Sent his immune system into overdrive, which fired up his lymphatic system. 
 What treatment protocol targets this mutation? 
 An MEK inhibitor. 
 The problem is, which one? 
 There are 41 possibilities, each with different side effects. 
 Good luck. 
 Well, I was hoping you could stay. 
 Okay. 
 Sure. 
 We need you to stay completely still. 
 Not a problem. 
 You okay? 
 Ryan totally bailed. 
 He hasn't come back to see me. 
 If you tell her that her mom said he couldn't visit, she'll be pissed at her mom. 
 How's that gonna help? 
 He's probably busy catching up in school. 
 We had a pact. 
 As long as we were together, cancer wasn't gonna beat us. 
 He broke it. 
 Cancer wins. 
 Do you mind finishing? 
 Imaging finished? 
 Not quite. 
 Mrs. 
 Valens, Angie would really like to see Ryan. 
 I know you're concerned about infection, but there is minimal risk. 
 Actually Actually, none, if they do a video chat. 
 Interesting idea. 
 I'll think about it. 
 Angie's depressed. 
 And studies have shown that that can have a negative impact on her surgical outcome. 
 Ryan doesn't always improve Angie's mood. 
 A couple of weeks ago, they had some silly fight, and she cried for days. 
 Thank you for letting me know. 
 I'm gonna do my best to cheer her up. 
 She's a 16-year-old. 
 She wants her boyfriend. 
 Yeah. 
 And how smart were you when you were 16? 
 Well, what about Selumetinib? 
 It's shown promising results on related conditions. 
 And a high occurrence of liver disease. 
 Binimetinib is similar, but has fewer complications. 
 Any objections? 
 Let's start James on that. 
 This is exciting, working together. 
 It is. 
 Although, I'm used to samples and slides instead of patients. 
 Patients can be difficult. 
 But you will be fine. 
 Do you need something? 
 I was curious how James was responding to the Binimetinib. 
 His urine output is up, which suggests the lymphatic fluid And his potassium is a little low. 
 Can you give him this? 
 I wasn't really Hi. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Lever. 
 The tumor's abutting and possibly infiltrating the white matter tracts of her fornix. 
 We'll likely have to remove a section. 
 That'll affect her ability to form memories. 
 With a lot of neuropsych rehab, she may be able to compensate with other pathways. 
 Studies have shown that positive attitudes lead to positive outcomes. 
 You're worried about her attitude? 
 She's worried about young love. 
 I'm worried about what Angie is facing after surgery. 
 Physical therapy, cognitive therapy, one challenge after another. 
 And what she wants is so simple. 
 You want to make a sad kid happy? 
 I guess I do. 
 Which isn't my job, and I need to stop getting sucked into people's personal issues. 
 Is there a way to do that without antagonizing the mother? 
 Maybe. 
 Then make her happy. 
 We've never gotten this far before. 
 No. 
 We haven't. 
 And you're okay? 
 I am very okay. 
 Carly. 
 Ohh. 
 Okay. 
 Did I do something wrong? 
 No, I'm sorry. 
 It's me. 
 You said we were okay. 
 I thought we were. 
 I-I want us to be. 
 You have no reason to still be mad. 
 I'm not mad. 
 I'm I'm just It's Morgan. 
 The medication caused James an upper GI bleed. 
 Have you localized the source of the bleeding? 
 Working on it. 
 Seems to be coming from the antrum of the stomach. 
 We stopped the Binimetinib. 
 On top of causing this, it hadn't done much to curtail the swelling. 
 Where's Dr. 
 Lever? 
 There's the ulcerative lesion. 
 Cautery. 
 Zebrafish. 
 They're used in medical research because of their quick maturation, and 84% of genes associated with human disease have a zebrafish equivalent. 
 You think we should do a transgenic expression of James' ARAF mutation into the zebrafish genome. 
 Translation for those of us without a genetics textbook handy? 
 We make mini-Jameses, as zebrafish, all with the same disorder. 
 Then we test every conceivable drug on those fish. 
 How long before we can start testing? 
 If we implant the embryos now, probably by late afternoon tomorrow. 
 Get going. 
 Shaun, go with her. 
 You have Path experience. 
 I understand no means no. 
 If you don't want to have sex, I accept that. 
 But I am very confused. 
 So am I. 
 I thought I was fine u-until I I told Lea to move out, like you wanted. 
 You said that things were okay. 
 They aren't. 
 How do I make them okay? 
 I can't tell you, because I don't know. 
 When I was in chemo, the nurses used to force that stuff down my throat, so I know you're not drinking it because of the taste. 
 It's fast, easy nutrition. 
 That and you don't end up puking your guts out in the bathroom. 
 I was president of this hospital for over 10 years. 
 I made a few friends, including Jack the janitor Talks a lot, A's fan, horrible gossip. 
 If the methotrexate is making you sick, we should try another medication. 
 How can you guarantee that you're not gonna throw up in the middle of your next surgery? 
 It won't happen. 
 Because it only happens if I eat solid food. 
 And I stopped. 
 At least at work. 
 That is a lot of fish tanks. 
 Forty. 
 So we can test all of the possible medications for Are you throwing a party? 
 Hope so. 
 How are you doing, Shaun? 
 Since your father passed away? 
 I don't think about him very much. 
 My mom died recently. 
 I-I don't know if you knew that. 
 She pops into my head all the time. 
 Not always the nicest thoughts. 
 It's okay not to love them. 
 They didn't make us who we are. 
 Has your mom gone home? 
 There is one more thing we have to deal with tonight. 
 Come on. 
 How many more sets of imaging can you possibly do? 
 One of these is your prom dress. 
 I like the pink, but I think you'd look gorgeous in both. 
 Hurry up and choose. 
 Your date'll be here soon. 
 All the medications are in. 
 Which means more waiting to see which medicine works. 
 It's hard to be patient. 
 Do you think the fish control how they react to the meds? 
 No. 
 It's just how their bodies respond. 
 That's how I felt last night. 
 I thought I was ready for us to be together, but my body had a different response. 
 I can't turn that response off any more than these fish can control how their mutation reacts to the medication. 
 Was our mutation me going to Wyoming with Lea? 
 Do you think we can find our right medication? 
 For me Darling, just dive right in Follow my lead I found a girl Beautiful and sweet You look amazing. 
 I never knew you were the someone waiting for me So do you. 
 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time Darling, just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes, you're holding mine Baby, I'm Dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favorite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath Looks like you might be feeling a little idiotic happiness right now. 
 Mm Maybe a touch. 
 No, no Dance with a prom king? 
 Ohh. 
 You look perfect tonight He's tachycardic. 
 We were talking, and then he just stopped. 
 We need to do a pericardial tap. 
 Call the cath lab. 
 Tell them we're coming. 
 No time. 
 We're doing it here. 
 James, the pain in your chest is from too much fluid around your heart. 
 We're gonna put a tube into your chest to drain it. 
 Call Shaun and Carly. 
 Tell them we're running out of time. 
 will be loving you till we're 70 And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23 And I'm thinking about how People fall in love in mysterious ways I brought Angie's Bearfeet Bear. 
 It always makes her feel like sh It's prom. 
 Ryan has been wearing his mask all night. 
 And I just want to tell you I am So, honey, now Take me into your loving arms Don't let her stay up too late. 
 Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars Place your hand on my beating heart Morgan called. 
 James isn't doing well. 
 Cross SL-327 off the list. 
 I see one No, two tumors. 
 Okay. 
 This is my stop. 
 I'll see you after. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too, Mom. 
 Don't worry. 
 Okay? 
 I got this. 
 I know you do. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 What if I wake up and don't remember Ryan at all? 
 Then You'll have the chance to fall in love with him all over again. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 We're down to five potential options. 
 I don't need five potential. 
 I need one actual. 
 There are two that best curb Choose one. 
 We should try Refametinib. 
 It caused abnormal cell growth. 
 Trametinib is safer. 
 Which doesn't mean it's safe. 
 Nothing's safe. 
 Which do you want us to do? 
 Trametinib. 
 That's the one. 
 Saline in. 
 Advancing scope toward the third ventricle. 
 Claire, hold gentle pressure on the tumor while I cut off its blood supply. 
 We've got some significant bleeding. 
 Adjust the scope and suction. 
 Look higher. 
 Septal vein There's your bleeder. 
 Cauterize away. 
 Micro dissector. 
 The tumor's immobile. 
 I can't resect it without injuring the nerve tracts. 
 She'd be comatose. 
 Try sharp dissection. 
 - I can't get a plane. 
 - How bad? 
 It's completely invaded her thalamus. 
 Thin it out with a suction aspirator. 
 It's too adherent. 
 If I keep going, I'm gonna k*ll her. 
 Any ideas? 
 Tell ICU Angie will be coming sooner than we planned. 
 Let's close her up. 
 What's next? 
 Another round of radiation, chemo? 
 Her carcinoma is unlikely to respond to those therapies. 
 No. 
 We have to try. 
 Angie will want to fight. 
 She's seizing. 
 Give me lorazepam and Dilantin, stat. 
 Phenobarb and propofol on deck. 
 You're crying. 
 Yes. 
 Why? 
 I found James on Facebook. 
 He and Marjorie want to go to Costa Rica. 
 Their dog is a three-legged rescue named Tripod. 
 He's not a slide. 
 He's a person. 
 He's a good person. 
 And he might die. 
 This is why I like to stay in the lab. 
 That Is a very dumb thing to say. 
 If you had stayed in the lab, James would probably be dead already. 
 Your plan with the zebrafish gave him a chance. 
 It was a beautiful, perfect idea, from a beautiful, almost perfect person. 
 Your earlobes are lopsided. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 We couldn't save her. 
 Ms. Valens? 
 Nice call on the zebrafish. 
 About our paper, let's meet weekly. 
 I'm thinking lunch every Tuesday in the cafeteria. 
 Perfect. 
 I heard about Melendez's patient. 
 Yeah. 
 You were right. 
 I should probably try another medication for my RA. 
 I need solid food. 
 Claire? 
 Wait up. 
 You okay? 
 Fine. 
 I'm just tired. 
 You did an amazing thing for Angie. 
 You gave her mother a memory that she will have forever. 
 Well, it won't make up for the daughter she lost. 
 You're angry. 
 I'm not. 
 I am sad. 
 - Who are you angry at? 
 - I'm not. 
 Are you angry at me and Glassman because we couldn't save her? 
 - No! 
 - At Angie? 
 No, you can't be mad at someone for dying! 
 That's not true. 
 You know that. 
 She was sick. 
 And she was trying to get better. 
 She failed and left you alone. 
 After you'd spent a lifetime trying to take care of her. 
 You have every reason to be mad at your mother. 
 I hate feeling this way. 
 My whole life, I've been angry at her, and now it will never change. 
 I don't know how to stop. 
 Therapy will help. 
 Time will help. 
 There is one other thing that's worked for me. 
 Did we fix our mutation? 
 That the best you got?"
gdoc_3_13,6470478,3,13,"Someone had a good night. 
 Do you think all of these people have had sex? 
 And if so, shouldn't they be more happy? 
 Maybe their experiences weren't as recent as yours. 
 I think about sex with everyone. 
 But mostly with Carly. 
 She and I are very compatible. 
 That's great, Shaun, but H. R. 
 might not approve. 
 About me thinking of sex? 
 No, about saying you're thinking about sex. 
 And stop it. 
 Smiling while talking to a dying man is not cool. 
 Dr. Blaize recommended we speak to you about a permanent port. 
 It would simplify your chemo sessions. 
 No more hunting for a vein every time. 
 Anything to help with the nausea? 
 It's a normal side effect. 
 Anything you can do for the exhaustion? 
 Anything so that my muscles don't ache? 
 But you can keep me from being stuck by a needle. 
 They're just trying to help. 
 I know. 
 All the doctors are trying to help. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Thank you. 
 But I-I don't need the port. 
 And I don't need any more chemo. 
 Of course you do. 
 It's going to give you more time. 
 Honey, I'm miserable. 
 Cerebral cavernous malformations. 
 Leads to bleeding, clots, seizures, muscle weakness, even paralysis. 
 You have clusters of them. 
 And they're getting worse. 
 The woman at Hopkins gave me a year. 
 Mass General, two years. 
 So, what, you figured I'd give you three? 
 Some new treatment? 
 You know the treatment, Caroline a lobectomy. 
 I love the way surgeons blithely suggest cutting through my cerebral cortex to remove part of my brain. 
 Hmm. 
 Why not just take an egg slicer to my ability to paint? 
 Yes, it will likely lead to a curtailment of your ability to be creative, but all of your other faculties will remain intact. 
 I had a severe prognosis of my own recently. 
 Surgery, chemo, radiation, the works. 
 My greatest fear wasn't at the edges of the spectrum. 
 It wasn't life or death. 
 My greatest fear was survival as something lesser. 
 Then you know. 
 And then I had a revelation of sorts. 
 Who I am, how I think of myself isn't defined by my skill as a surgeon. 
 Uh, I'm seeing you as a courtesy. 
 I don't do this anymore. 
 And guess what? 
 I'm fine. 
 I'm happier. 
 You could have 20, 30 more years with your family. 
 A balanced life isn't necessarily a lesser life. 
 I disagree. 
 20 bucks says Shaun mentions sex in front of a patient in the next 24 hours. 
 He's excited. 
 I'm sure you were when a new world opened up. 
 But he knows better. 
 - 20 bucks. 
 - No. 
 Morgan. 
 Oh, I was hoping I'd see you. 
 Hello. 
 Perfect. 
 I was just wondering where to get lunch around here. 
 Any genre, as long as it's locally sourced. 
 Is this a friend? 
 I'm Caroline Reznick. 
 Oh, hi. 
 My mother. 
 What are you doing here? 
 What beautiful eyes. 
 I hope s-someone p-paint Mom! 
 Mom? 
 Mom. 
 Mom, can you hear me? 
 Code blue. 
 We need a crash cart. 
 I've come to take you to lunch. 
 It's only 11:15. 
 M-Morgan told me that it might be considered unprofessional to discuss sex on the job. 
 So, when you say ""lunch"" It's sex. 
 I am expected to be here working. 
 People in the Pathology Lab take two 15-minute breaks on their shift. 
 If they were combined into one and we used the bus that stops out front at 11:25, with one returning at 12:15, and we borrowed some of your lunch hour You only require 22 minutes to eat a sandwich There would be just enough time to get to your apartment and back. 
 Have you noticed the time you've allotted for ""lunch"" is fairly short? 
 Long enough. 
 Long enough for you, not for me. 
 You've only had sex once in your life. 
 No one expects you to win awards, and it was lovely sharing the moment. 
 Are you implying the sex could be improved on? 
 Yes. 
 Does that bother you? 
 No. 
 I have no objection to improving sex. 
 Although, I thought it was already excellent. 
 I'll work on it. 
 Found the source of the bleed. 
 Suctioning and evacuating the clot cavity. 
 The Cav Mals are everywhere. 
 She could have a massive bleed at any time. 
 I thought Morgan's parents were doctors. 
 I heard that, too. 
 Why would Morgan let us think Maybe you should save the speculation until your hands aren't in my mother's skull. 
 Use your inside voice, Morgan. 
 Turn down the volume. 
 Irrigate and remove the cottonoid. 
 Why didn't she tell us she was one of those Reznicks? 
 Caroline Reznick, painter. 
 Her son's a sculptor. 
 Daughter's a composer. 
 Didn't know she had another kid. 
 They're famous, if you're into the arts at all. 
 Mia got you going to galleries? 
 Yeah, I'm kind of loving it. 
 I've failed Carly twice. 
 Did you forget her birthday or stand her up? 
 Are you talking about sex? 
 Uh, Morgan says H. R. would prefer I avoid that word. 
 Just to be clear, are you saying she Are you saying she didn't There was no parade. 
 Oh. 
 There was a parade for me, but there was no parade for Carly. 
 I want to give her a parade. 
 I'll continue reading. 
 Wait, Shaun, reading's a great start, but Carly's a person. 
 You need to communicate with her, ask her what she likes. 
 Yes. 
 I'll make an extensive list of questions. 
 It's not just about questions and answers. 
 Nonverbal communication is pretty key in this area. 
 I'm not good with nonverbal communication. 
 Watch her reactions. 
 See what Carly responds to. 
 You'll figure this out. 
 Mrs. 
 Reznick, I'm Dr. 
 Park. 
 This is Dr. Murphy, Dr. Browne. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Excellent. 
 And flattered that three surgeons are here to check on me. 
 They're curious. 
 About what monster created me. 
 I'm sure that's not true. 
 Morgan, you're smart and nice and perfectly normal. 
 I don't think she's all of those things. 
 You guys here to take her vitals, check her for any deficits, and maybe let her know that she's just gonna keep getting worse and die? 
 Your daughter is right, Mrs. 
 Reznick. 
 - If you don't - Dr. 
 Browne, the day lilies go so well with your eyes. 
 Please take them. 
 This variety is from the Himalayas. 
 Please. 
 I really am grateful to you all. 
 I'm asking other people to take over my cases. 
 Check your in-box, and you'll see the three I've given you. 
 In your language, the word ""ask"" must mean something different. 
 You're a caring, empathetic person, and my mother is sick. 
 As long as we're having a moment of honesty why do you hate your family? 
 You told me your mother was a cardiologist. 
 No, you told me my mother was a cardiologist. 
 I can't correct all your mistakes. 
 Was that the mother you wanted to have? 
 Cardiac perfusionist, call the cath lab. 
 I used to daydream my mother was a lawyer. 
 That's just weird. 
 I'm Oliver. 
 I have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, so I've only got six months to live. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Melendez. 
 What happened to your foot? 
 Skydiving. 
 First time. 
 They coached me how to roll, but it didn't quite work out. 
 He rented a plane. 
 A small one. 
 All the classes were full. 
 I did not want to wait. 
 You should've come with me. 
 I'm afraid of heights. 
 So was I. 
 Not anymore. 
 Hmm. 
 Nothing's broken. 
 Ice it tonight. 
 Try to stay off it for a few days. 
 I'll give you 12 hours. 
 Lots to do, so I might be okay with limping. 
 As long as I'm here, can I get vaccinated for tropical diseases? 
 Thinking about moving somewhere the weather will be perfect for the next six months. 
 The dry season in Costa Rica is just beginning. 
 Excellent. 
 I've always wanted to see Costa Rica. 
 They have mantled howler monkeys that make this haunting call at dawn and dusk. 
 Wouldn't that be great to wake up to? 
 Oliver skydiving doesn't bring happiness. 
 Neither do monkey howls. 
 You gonna tell a dying guy he can't do what he wants to do? 
 No. 
 Get me the sh*ts. 
 What happened to the patient who was in here? 
 She checked herself out. 
 I knew I had to be in early, so I tried not to wake you. 
 Appreciate it. 
 I've brought you - a jelly doughnut and coffee - Thank you. 
 to celebrate last night's breakthrough. 
 What breakthrough was that? 
 Last night. 
 You had a parade. 
 During lunch. 
 You made a lot of noise. 
 One fairly loud noise A moan. 
 Oh. 
 Right, right. 
 You had your elbow on my hair. 
 I had a great time last night, and I really appreciate how much effort you put into my happiness. 
 But no parade. 
 Parades aren't always required. 
 I'll keep working on it. 
 Cassie, stay in Hong Kong. 
 It would be ridiculous to miss the premiere of your symphony because of a medical glitch. 
 I have to go. 
 Your sister's here. 
 Bye. 
 You're in time for brunch. 
 I didn't know where you were staying, if you'd left town, if you'd gone home. 
 I finally got your new housekeeper on the phone and convinced her I was your daughter. 
 She said you never mentioned me. 
 Oh, Blanca's very forgetful. 
 Pull up a chair. 
 Your brother's out getting salmon. 
 - Ariel's here? 
 - He got great news. 
 Million-dollar commission A bronze piece on the mall. 
 I'm thrilled. 
 Can we talk about the fact that you're dying? 
 No. 
 I'm having a good arthritis day. 
 Why shouldn't I feel happy? 
 You're so lucky you didn't inherit anything from me. 
 Morgan. 
 I thought Mom ditched the medical police. 
 Right, the bad guys trying to keep her alive. 
 We've all tried to get her to change her mind, but you know what she's like. 
 I'm using a little sriracha just to throttle your taste buds. 
 Thank you. 
 I've been strategizing with Cassie via e-mail, trying to figure out a way to convince Mom Did it occur to either of you to mention any of this to the only doctor in the family? 
 Plenty of doctors already involved. 
 And you barely consider yourself part of this family. 
 You exclude me, and it's my fault? 
 Morgan, in high school, kids kept asking about my parents, the spies. 
 And my friend Joel at Georgetown said you told people your parents were in the Peace Corps. 
 And that you were an only child. 
 I got tired of fielding questions about my famous mother. 
 - It doesn't mean - Only child. 
 You're offended that you weren't in the family I completely made up? 
 I got tired of hearing ""Your mother is so talented. 
 How wonderful your brother's an artist. 
 How amazing Cassie writes music. 
 What do you do?"" Mom! 
 Grab a towel. 
 It's not just about what you do physically. 
 It's about setting a scene, offering inspiration. 
 I mean, do you know what movies she likes or what actors she thinks are sexy? 
 She likes the ""Alien"" movies. 
 Something else? 
 She loves ""Outlander. 
 "" That is a good idea. 
 Where the hell is everybody?! 
 Complex partial seizure. 
 Cut her finger off with an electric knife. 
 Knuckle's still there, but we need to get her to an O. R. 
 Whoa, whoa! 
 No one touches that but the surgeon. 
 Bloody towels get thrown out all the time. 
 I'm not dumpster diving while cells die. 
 The last of the circumferential sutures. 
 Good capillary refill in the fingertip. 
 What if this wasn't caused by the Cav Mals? 
 First the bleeding, then the seizure Pretty typical progression. 
 It's also possible the bleeding caused the seizure. 
 Microbleeds can cause gliosis, and that can cause a seizure. 
 And if the seizure was caused by gliosis, we could simply remove that one bit of damaged tissue. 
 She'd still be terminal, but Shaun is right, but he's wrong. 
 Volume! 
 Shaun's idea could stop the seizures and let her keep painting for the time she has left. 
 That's something she'll agree to. 
 Which is why he's wrong. 
 If she stops having the seizures, there's no way she'll have the lobectomy that will save her life. 
 We don't choose procedures in order to manipulate patients. 
 No, we choose procedures based on what will have the greatest benefit. 
 Dr. Melendez, I'd like to excuse myself to speak with the patient's daughter. 
 Please. 
 I know not disclosing a treatment is borderline unethical, but when there is a cure that the patient is ignoring You don't want her to die. 
 Thanks for the summation. 
 But have you considered it might be more than that? 
 This cure, it doesn't come without a cost. 
 To your mother. 
 But to you if your mother loses her artistic ability, your relationship changes. 
 If she loses the thing she lords over you, she Maybe she'd be nicer. 
 You hate the way she looks at you. 
 But that is who she is. 
 Let's try it Shaun's way. 
 Sorry about this all-nighter, but sleeplessness will increase the odds of a seizure event. 
 Which isn't pleasant, but we need. 
 All this equipment will tell us if it was caused by the Cav Mals or by a remote microbleed. 
 You want me to put on the TV? 
 I find something suitably irritating. 
 Don't bother. 
 I'll be staying. 
 ""Cavernous malformations may leak blood, leading to brain hemorrhage, seizures, loss of sensation, risk of paralysis"" If you have to do this, can't you find some ""Harry Potter"" or something? 
 We can look forward. 
 Or we can look back. 
 Do you want to discuss what a lousy mother you were? 
 Baby, I know that stress and anger can increase the chance of a seizure, and you're so sweet to try Shall we go chronologically? 
 First day of preschool, when you promised to pick me up, but you forgot because you were showing Ariel how to underpaint with raw umber. 
 You wore a kilt? 
 How'd it go? 
 We binge-watched six episodes of ""Outlander,"" she fell asleep on the sofa, so I came back to work. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Oliver. 
 I have six months to live. 
 Hello, Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Park. 
 I went out. 
 In a new Ferrari. 
 But when I got home, I started to feel dizzy, sick to my stomach. 
 Fainted and hit my head. 
 I think I might have been poisoned by the fugu fish. 
 You ate a fish you knew might k*ll you. 
 You're emptying the bank accounts. 
 Only my retirement savings, which I'm not gonna need. 
 You don't have fugu poisoning. 
 I know because you're not already paralyzed or dead. 
 Ow. 
 We'll keep you for observation and run some tests. 
 Uh, how long? 
 We have a room booked in Costa Rica. 
 Enough. 
 I can't quit my job and move to the jungle. 
 Actually, you can. 
 I won't stay here. 
 You're gonna leave me? 
 I've invited you to come with me. 
 I want us to see Costa Rica together. 
 You're choosing the howler monkeys over me? 
 That's where I rank, behind the monkeys? 
 Bella, I love you. 
 I've loved our 20 years together. 
 I want to see Costa Rica. 
 I want you to come with me. 
 But I'm going either way. 
 Go. 
 I don't want to spend whatever time is left with whoever you are now. 
 I'm happy. 
 I thought I made you happy. 
 Jumping ahead. 
 The day I won the regional science fair, beating five other schools, including those nerds from Alston Prep, do you know what you said to me? 
 That you were so glad I had something to fall back on. 
 I'm aware of your feelings about me as a mother. 
 I'm aware that our values are different. 
 It doesn't mean I don't love you. 
 I always have. 
 It didn't matter that you weren't creative. 
 You seriously don't think there's creativity in what I do? 
 I think that's something technical people tell themselves. 
 But it's not a moral judgment. 
 It's the luck of the draw. 
 I'm an artist. 
 You're a hard worker. 
 August 12, 2014 Times art section. 
 I don't want to hear it. 
 ""Caroline Reznick's showing at the Armory is a lesson in what happens when a once-interesting artist sits too long on her laurels. 
 "" That woman hated me for years. 
 She was waiting for an opportunity. 
 ""Bad judgment doesn't begin to explain what went wrong with every stroke of this ill-conceived"" I mean, really, how many negative words can you pile together? 
 And she hasn't even gotten to that part about that ""Modern Madonna"" piece that you were so proud of. 
 What Remember what she What she called it? 
 - What was that? 
 - Put that thing down! 
 I'm sorry. 
 It's not gliosis. 
 I went through that for nothing? 
 Mom, we eliminated a possibility. 
 That's not nothing. 
 It's a day I spent in this hospital when I could've been home working. 
 How soon can I be discharged? 
 You need to rest for a day. 
 And then we can say goodbye. 
 If I only had six months to live, I would not stop being a surgeon. 
 I would. 
 I'd move from spa to spa, having massages and drinks with little umbrellas. 
 Then I'd throw a party in the penthouse of the Four Seasons. 
 And after everybody left, I'd go into the marble bathroom and painlessly self-euthanize. 
 I'd obviously leave a big tip for housekeeping. 
 You're very like your mother. 
 That's not something I hear a lot. 
 Well, he's right. 
 You would reign like a queen over your own death, insisting on absolute control. 
 I just meant you each have a funny way of picking things up with both hands sometimes. 
 I don't think this is anatomically correct. 
 Hmm. 
 Hmm. 
 Stereotactic laser ablation. 
 You worked with one of the people who developed the technique. 
 We never used to call it that. 
 I never liked that name. 
 Also, it's never been used in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations. 
 Not yet. 
 It would allow us to target the malformations without needing to slice all those cerebral fibers or remove a chunk of my mother's brain. 
 It would have to be applied to each malformation with exact precision. 
 Okay, so do that. 
 You can't. 
 You're gonna make a mistake on one or two of them. 
 And then you got more bleeding, seizures, you got inflamed malformations growing out of control. 
 You can. 
 Even if I was still a neurosurgeon, which I'm not, I wouldn't. 
 You don't get to quit who you are. 
 How long has it been since you had your hands inside the source of what makes us human? 
 That flow, in surgery, knowing every move and just feeling how right it is That's peak existence. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm not gonna do the surgery. 
 Are you s Are you scared to pick up a scalpel? 
 You had months of chemo and radiation. 
 Maybe it took its toll. 
 E-Even a 10% drop in performance would be unbearable. 
 Why risk finding it out? 
 Get out. 
 Skydiving? 
 Fugu? 
 And apparently a yellow suit. 
 Do you think a deadline like he has burns you down to who you really are? 
 Or does it just make you nuts and desperate? 
 Why can't it be both? 
 Hmm. 
 Okay, um a little house in the middle of nowhere. 
 Two chickens. 
 One dog. 
 Nobody who expects anything from me. 
 Nobody who is even verbal. 
 I'm tired of trying to fix myself. 
 And I'm tired of being known as a soft touch. 
 Not buying it. 
 There's no way you would get a dog if you only had six months to live. 
 Wouldn't be fair. 
 Okay, then I would foster a series of rescue dogs. 
 You said you're tired of being a soft touch, and yet your fantasy involves helping. 
 We are who we are. 
 It's called stereotactic laser ablation. 
 Never liked the name. 
 He said it's minimally invasive, and if it works, it would save my life and allow me to continue painting. 
 If I win, I win everything. 
 And if I lose, it's over. 
 When you first came to see Dr. 
 Glassman, he didn't offer this option. 
 Why not? 
 Stereotactic laser ablation is a new technique, and it's never been used on a Cav Mal patient. 
 So, he just didn't think of it? 
 But then it came to him? 
 It was my idea. 
 Dr. 
 Glassman didn't sugarcoat the risks. 
 This is the last chance you've got to keep your art. 
 I'm not going to complete my work if I'm dead. 
 No. 
 But thank you so much for trying. 
 Why didn't you back me up? 
 I didn't know you were gonna throw this crapshoot at us. 
 Do you even listen to what she's been saying? 
 She wants to finish her work. 
 She could live another 40 years, and her art would grow with her. 
 Don't pretend those words mean anything to you. 
 You don't give a damn about art. 
 Her family could grow with her Her children, her grandchildren. 
 You and her don't give a damn about anything except for art. 
 You need to listen to me and do what I tell you. 
 This is why we didn't call you. 
 The competition in that family must have been like a buzz saw. 
 - Okay. 
 - Please. 
 It's perfectly reasonable to get out of a game you can't win. 
 You did everything right Moved 3,000 miles, found your own calling, a career people respect and value. 
 Actually, there's a good comparative measure for how people value things. 
 We call it money. 
 And my brother's already a million dollars ahead. 
 See how you went straight to your brother? 
 Did you ever think he might be tired of being your competitor? 
 He won a long time ago. 
 That's why I left that dysfunctional world behind. 
 Really? 
 Because it seems to me you re-created the competition you grew up with the very first day you got here. 
 Shingles? 
 Like, from chicken pox? 
 The virus was dormant, then your chemo suppressed your immune system, and the virus woke up. 
 It can be painful, but the treatment is very simple. 
 Do you want us to call your wife? 
 No, thank you. 
 Just fix me up and release me into the wild. 
 Back to the bucket list. 
 She was right. 
 I'm not the same person. 
 I'm doing what we all should be doing. 
 We all want to cut loose, but we're just too practical. 
 If this had not happened, I might've lived to be 90, never looking up. 
 Dr. 
 Murphy, what do you want to do that you just haven't done yet? 
 What makes you happy? 
 - I want to give Carly - Shaun. 
 Oh. 
 I like a crisp apple. 
 The way the sunlight hits my bedsheets in the morning in a perfect square. 
 I like the movement of wind in leaves. 
 And the way the circumference of a circle is always equal to pi times the diameter, no matter what numbers you put in. 
 You like the happiness of small things. 
 Yes. 
 Your happiness is too loud. 
 Shake your head again. 
 Didn't he have a muscle issue? 
 His range of motion seems good. 
 All the better for zip-lining in Costa Rica, right? 
 Not right. 
 We need more tests. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I know we want the same things. 
 I'd like to show you something. 
 Neurons that fire together wire together. 
 One neuron goes off, exciting the next, creating a pathway in the brain that wasn't there before. 
 Every time Mom takes a brushstroke, every time you use a chisel. 
 It's like we're creating ourselves in the choices we make. 
 We are creating this. 
 It's beautiful. 
 We target each malformation with a thermal laser probe. 
 Just the malformation. 
 The trajectory has to be perfect. 
 You can't paint over it. 
 You could show this to Mom. 
 But from you, she'll accept it. 
 Inserting the laser probe into the cooling catheter. 
 Locked and loaded. 
 Ready to fire. 
 Dr. Glassman, are you sure of this location? 
 It seems significantly far from what we saw on her pre-surgical MRIs. 
 You know what the brain and breakfast cereal have in common? 
 Contents tend to shift during transport. 
 Yes, I'm quite sure. 
 First ablation complete. 
 Now we just have to do it perfectly nine more times. 
 It's gone? 
 Well, not quite. 
 But close. 
 The recent infections got into the tumor. 
 Which allowed your immune system to find it. 
 But they said it was an aggressive cancer. 
 What makes a cancer aggressive is its ability to evade the immune system. 
 That's no longer true about yours. 
 The tumor has become small enough to remove surgically. 
 We can make an appointment to do that in a few days, once the infection has fully cleared your system. 
 Meanwhile, you can go home. 
 Congratulations. 
 Home? 
 How do you feel? 
 Tired. 
 Of being in this place. 
 Reasonable answer. 
 Do you feel your creativity's impaired? 
 Isn't that the graphic you use to sign your paintings? 
 Thank you for knowing that. 
 Ariel was afraid you'd feel vandalized. 
 Ah, don't be silly. 
 We'll auction off the door. 
 Mom, you've thanked your doctors, but you haven't said anything to Morgan. 
 You know, getting out of this mess intact, that's down to her. 
 Oh, yes, I know. 
 I owe you everything. 
 Thank you for saving my life. 
 You're welcome. 
 Our little plodder came through. 
 Not everybody gets a parade. 
 Maybe Carly doesn't have them. 
 Maybe I haven't practiced enough. 
 I've worked on my surgical technique for hundreds of hours. 
 You can't just take the pizza out of the freezer and dig in. 
 You have to put it in the microwave first. 
 Actually, Dr. Lim, a toaster oven is better for the crust. 
 She's not talking about pizza, Shaun. 
 Mm. 
 Men your age run out of patience. 
 They turn off the microwave before that pizza's ready. 
 You want to give a parade, Shaun? 
 Yes. 
 You want to give a great parade? 
 Are there differences in parades? 
 Some have balloons and marching bands. 
 Other parades are sparsely attended. 
 I want Carly to have the best parade possible. 
 I know you do. 
 Just as you want to be the best surgeon possible. 
 When you're in the O. R. , you commit totally. 
 You persevere. 
 Everything else falls away. 
 You focus entirely on what you're doing. 
 That's your superpower. 
 Now I want you to take Carly home and work that parade route and don't stop until the band begins playing. 
 And then go 3% longer. 
 I will. 
 See you tomorrow. 
 All that focus. 
 Strangely intriguing. 
 If I only had six months to live, I wouldn't want to be anywhere but where I am. 
 Are you getting on?

 It's time to wake up. 
 Mnh-mnh. 
 It's still dark outside. 
 I'd like to have sex. 
 (SIGHS) 
 As romantically as that was put, it's too early, Shaun. 
 It's exactly early enough to have sex for the average duration it takes us and still allow precisely enough time to get ready for work. 
 (SIGHS) 
 How long have you been up figuring that out? 
 Since 4:53. 
 But it only took two minutes. 
 You've been waiting since then to propose this? 
 I let you sleep as long as possible. 
 That's very considerate.

 Sorry, I'm late. 
 I'm Dr. 
 Shaun Murphy. 
 Kayley has a sore throat. 
 [ HOARSELY .] More like this constant feeling like there's something stuck in my throat. 
 And I've fainted a couple times, which I first thought was just random. 
 And I'm obviously losing my voice. 
 Since I've only just met you, I have no idea what your voice normally sounds like. 
 Well, not this. 
 Sometimes when swallowing, I get a super intense pain, like, worse than an ice cream headache. 
 My internist sent me to an ear, nose, and throat guy, an orthopedic surgeon, um, three gastroenterologists, a voice issues specialist dude. 
 An otolaryngologist. 
 a-a neurosurgeon who thinks it might be a messed up nerve connecting the throat to the brain. 
 The ninth cranial nerve, glossopharyngeal neuralgia. 
 He recommended, like, brain surgery. 
 Microvascular decompression. 
 Which a second neurosurgeon said I don't need. 
 You're not happy with the answers you're getting from a whole bunch of recommended specialists, so you came to the ER? 
 I ran out of recommended specialists. 
 Hmm. 
 It is an intriguing combination of symptoms. 
 We'll admit you and run some tests. 
 Uh, Dr. 
 Murphy? 
 You're Interesting. 
 I have autism. 
 That's so cool. 
 Uh, I mean, no Sor Not Not cool that you are. 
 Be more insensitive, Kayley. 
 Um It's cool that you're this Totally chill, super knowledgeable medico.

 I'm going to get brain FIESTA and time-of-flight MRI to assess the cranial nerves and vessels, and Doppler ultrasound to I have to get back to work. 
 Our pre-dawn romantic interlude made me late. 
 Yes. 
 There was a flaw in my methodology. 
 My calculation was based on the mean duration of our sex overall, but generally, we take statistically significantly longer in the morning than at other times of day. 
 Well, maybe we can discuss this whole timing-our-sex thing at lunchtime. 
 Mm. 
 No, thank you. 
 I can't have lunch today. 
 Too much to do. 
 (IMPERCEPTIBLE CHATTER) 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 I was going to cancel our lunch. 
 Let me guess. 
 A patient more interesting than me. 
 Exactly. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Yeah. 
 She has a mysterious condition. 
 But I realized I could use our lunch to help understand it. 
 - I ordered you a salad. 
 - Thank you. 
 How do I get an ice cream headache? 
 I've never had one. 
 You don't want one. 
 Brain freeze is horrible. 
 The scientific term is sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia. 
 The trigeminal nerve reacts to rapid temperature change in the mouth, sending a signal to the brain, which responds with changes in blood flow and dura irritation, which combats what it perceives as a dangerous, noxious stimuli, but is just ice cream. 
 I need to experience that. 
 Okay. 
 The technique I usually use is, eat way too much, way too fast. 
 (INHALES) 
 I'm quitting my job. 
 The job you came back from Hershey for? 
 Don't tell Glassy. 
 He already thinks I'm a flake. 
 You kicking me out is just what I needed. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I was in a complete rut. 
 In my personal life, at work, super stale. 
 I mean, we weren't developing anything, just market testing designs Ow. 
 Ow! 
 Ow, ow! 
 That's awful! 
 - What's the cure? 
 - Time. 
 - How much time? 
 - Depends. 
 Do you think I should include my job in Hershey on my resume? 
 It hurts so much! 
 Or does it make me look like I'm unable to commit to anything? 
 Ow! 
 Okay. 
 The ultrasound showed your colon is distended. 
 We placed a rectal tube and an NG to try to get that decompressed. 
 Mommy, can we go home? 
 Not yet, sweetie. 
 It would be helpful to try to find out what could've triggered this. 
 Any history of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis? 
 No. 
 I, um I have had some UTIs lately. 
 That's likely not connected. 
 - Okay. 
 - PARK: Diverticulitis? 
 Any recent international travel? 
 I have a three-year-old and no husband. 
 MELENDEZ: Okay. 
 We're gonna need to keep you on IV antibiotics and monitor the distention. 
 In the meantime, is there anyone who can look after Marla? 
 No one. 
 My whole family's back east. 
 It's It's just us. 
 I'll get a social worker to look after her. 
 Thank you. 
 Go ahead, honey. 
 Why is my mom upset? 
 (SIGHS) 
 If her anterior inferior cerebellar artery is encroaching on her glossopharyngeal nerve, it's very minor. 
 Certainly not enough to justify microvascular decompression surgery. 
 I agree. 
 It could also be acid reflux temporal arteritis, laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia. 
 We need to We need to do $50,000 of tests, and it might be acid reflux? 
 Or temporal arteritis or It's a constellation of relatively insignificant symptoms. 
 Have you ever had an ice cream headache, Dr. 
 Andrews? 
 Yes. 
 I believe it didn't require brain surgery, Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 As a compromise, we could do an MRI and CT her neck and a swallow Shaun. 
 You don't compromise with your boss. 
 Start her on dilantin for her pain and send her home. 
 Can I just leave her with you? 
 I'm a receptionist, not a social worker. 
 And I'm a surgeon. 
 I didn't mean I'm more important. 
 I just meant we both have more important things to do. 
 When will the social worker be here? 
 She said half an hour. 
 Can you page her again? 
 I want my mama. 
 Why don't you just go play with the toys, okay? 
 Do you have her number? 
 I'll call her myself. 
 I made Mommy sick. 
 No, sweetie. 
 It's not your fault. 
 Sometimes people just get sick. 
 Mommy drawk ma poop. 
 - Your mommy drew your poop? 
 - No! 
 Drawk. 
 Mommy drawk. 
 Drank? 
 Yes. 
 Mommy drawnk my poop. 
 The good news is, we've ruled out glossopharyngeal neuralgia. 
 You don't need brain surgery. 
 Never any good news without bad news. 
 We've got a list of a few things you don't have, but we don't know what you do have. 
 So you'll run more tests. 
 We can't. 
 There are 21 different things this might be, but they don't want us to run 37 more tests. 
 Well, this is lame. 
 I can afford the tests. 
 I make good money.

 Repopulating the colon microbiome using FM has shown some success.

 A normal styloid process is 2. 
 5 centimeters in length. 
 Yours measures Don't do that. 
 There are two surgical options. 
 Transoral, where we go in through your mouth. 
 It's non-invasive, but creates surgical challenges for physical and visual access. 
 The alternative transcervical procedure involves an incision in your neck with none of those access issues, but with some post-operative scarring. 
 So one way is safer, but the other way, I'll look better? 
 It's a pretty bad-ass scar. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Can I take a bit to decide which? 
 Of course. 
 You had no right to tell the world about me. 
 It was flattering.

 I've got reporters clamoring to speak to the ""twice-exceptional"" Dr.

 Bad idea. 
 Luckily, he won't do it. 
 He went off on Kayley about his privacy. 
 The publicity would be good for the hospital. 
 And I'm sure Dr. 
 Glassman can make him see the wisdom of that. 
 MELENDEZ: I'm with Andrews. 
 It smacks of us patting ourselves on the back. 
 It could also come off as exploitative. 
 But the bigger issue is, it could blow up in our face. 
 Shaun is a complete communications wild card. 
 Who knows what he'll say about you, about me, about being demoted, about screw-ups. 
 Well, we would have to coach him. 
 Do we have six years before they need to go to press? 
 I can go with him, manage the situation. 
 GLASSMAN: No, no, no. 
 If we consider Shaun an asset, we shouldn't treat him like a liability. 
 I'll talk to him, see what he says. 
 You can see the proximity of her elongated styloid to the nerves and carotid. 
 The trick is to break off the excess length without injury to local neurovascular structures. 
 If done transcervically, entry point is key. 
 Minimizes risk of a marginal mandibular nerve injury. 
 Has she made a decision? 
 SHAUN: Not yet. 
 I'd like to lead. 
 Being that it's such a rare surgery, I may not get another chance at it during residency. 
 When I have the benefit of supervision. 
 And it wouldn't have anything to do with hoping Kayley might then post glowingly about you? 
 Not at all. 
 Well, undoubtedly, a little. 
 Given the attention this case has drawn, I think we should put our best, most experienced choice forward. 
 Well, this is a teaching hospital. 
 It's exactly the type of surgery we'd give to a third-year. 
 The fact that she has an online presence shouldn't be a factor. 
 And yet here you are, the Chief of Surgery working a case you say a third-year can handle. 
 It also might reflect well on this place to have a young woman be the face of Kayley's surgery. 
 Assuming it goes well.

 No. 
 It's not personal. 
 It's a little personal. 
 I'm doing a favor for Shaun. 
 I don't really need anyone. 
 Did he ask you to waste my time? 
 Yeah It's okay. 
 I didn't really want to work for you anyway. 
 You're a bit of a grouch. 
 But make sure whoever does do the job shores up your firewall. 
 A kindergartner can hack it. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sure we'll be fine. 
 And you're right, you know. 
 We are not a good fit. 
 And our mutual affection for Shaun isn't enough to stop us from k*lling each other.

 I'm sure the mother doesn't regret a thing. 
 At least she shouldn't. 
 I'm with Claire. 
 Do you have time for lunch? 
 And by ""lunch,"" you mean? 
 Lunch. 
 I need advice. 
 I need to really think about something. 
 Oh. 
 Then yes, of course. 
 CARLY: It could be patronizing, being put up as some kind of feel-good, human interest story. 
 Or objectified and glorified as some kind of a symbol for people who are different. 
 But I also know that when I told my sister your story, she cried. 
 She was sad? 
 No, she was inspired. 
 (EXHALES SHAKILY) 
 I don't know what your advice is telling me. 
 I don't know what you think I'm supposed to do. 
 Shaun, you aren't supposed to do anything, except what you believe is right. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Thank you. 
 Now I'm going to go see what Lea thinks. 
 I thought you had a surgery. 
 I'm just going upstairs. 
 Lea's meeting with Dr. 
 Glassman about a job. 
 - A job here? 
 - Yes. 
 Lea told me at lunch yesterday that she was looking for different work, so Wait, you you had lunch with Lea? 
 Yesterday? 
 And And you kept it from me? 
 I didn't keep it from you. 
 There was no reason to mention it until just now, when I did. 
 Shaun You know how I feel about how Lea hovers over our relationship. 
 And You're just sneaking around with her? 
 Arranging for her to work here, where she'll just loom all the more. 
 She won't be looming or hovering. 
 She'll be on a whole other floor.

 Shaun lied to me about having lunch with Lea. 
 No, he didn't. 
 Shaun is incapable of deceit. 
 He must have genuinely thought that you wouldn't mind. 
 Well, then, he is completely tone deaf and insensitive, which are not better qualities in a boyfriend. 
 True. 
 But not exactly unanticipated when you get into a relationship with Shaun. 
 And it's never really about the lie. 
 It's what's underneath. 
 You're jealous of Lea. 
 I am not jealous. 
 I am concerned You don't need to justify. 
 I'm on team jealousy. 
 It's flattering, stimulating, it It means you're committed and you care. 
 It's ugly and reflects underlying trust issues that I don't want to Yeah, yeah, yeah, like all things, a little is good, and a lot will k*ll you.

 No reason to anticipate any future problems. 
 So, the question is, what do we tell her? 
 That the surgery was a success. 
 She had a cerebral ischemia. 
 On the table. 
 That did no damage and that there's no evidence of. 
 Hospital policy is transparency We don't tell them what music we played, what we talked about. 
 This isn't relevant to the outcome or to her prognosis. 
 Would you be taking the same position if Kayley wasn't someone whose criticism could go viral? 
 ANDREWS: I don't know. 
 But it would be delusional to think it's not relevant. 
 Dr. 
 Reznick. 
 Any thoughts? 
 I don't think I can fairly offer an opinion, because my career could hang in the balance. 
 Yeah, well, none of us are disinterested parties, given the hospital's reputation is also at stake. 
 Did you screw up? 
 Could that crisis have been avoided? 
 If it could have been, then we are all responsible. 
 We were watching everything she was doing, and none of us told her to stop. 
 This is an easy call. 
 There's only one reason to tell her everything, and that's you might feel guilty if you don't. 
 On the other hand, there's the future of this hospital. 
 Okay. 
 Shaun, if the patient asks for details about the surgery, can you limit your answers? 
 I don't know. 
 Okay, we need to know if No. 
 Dr. 
 Murphy, I hope you will limit your answers. 
 But I won't order you to defy your conscience. 
 We don't normally have patients share rooms, but She's? 
 Gonna be completely fine. 
 And once she's recuperated, we'll begin her on statins and Ezetimibe, and she'll undergo lipid apheresis. 
 It's kind of like dialysis, but it'll allow us to extract LDL out of her blood. 
 Should get her cholesterol to within normal range. 
 She'll need those dr*gs and that other stuff for the rest of her life? 
 Yes. 
 But hopefully a very long one.

 That didn't affect anything. 
 You sure about that? 
 'Cause I'm not. 
 CARLY: Did you speak to Lea? 
 Yes. 
 I know she's a good friend. 
 And it would be unfair for me to expect you to cut her out of your life. 
 But You going to ask her opinion right after I had given mine, it just called up Wyoming all over again. 
 That you preferred Lea to me. 
 I was jealous. 
 And it's something that I have to work out. 
 For the two of us to work out. 
 Together. 
 What was Lea's advice? 
 That it'd be selfish not to share my story with the world. 
 I liked your advice better.

 MELENDEZ: Hey. 
 Uh-oh. 
 Actually, yeah. 
 There's something awkward we need to talk about.

 You can reopen the door. 
 There's nothing remotely improper going on. 
 I received an anonymous favoritism complaint. 
 We need to deal with it. 
 I don't want to talk to reporters. 
 I know. 
 So if I talked to reporters, it wouldn't be honest to who I really am. 
 Well, sometimes, Shaun, people present a different version of themselves depending upon the circumstances. 
 Like, I'm not always the same here as I am at home. 
 I don't. 
 No, you don't. 
 I considered all the arguments.

 Not a good autistic doctor."

 These are perfect. 
 I'm glad you like your breakfast. 
 I read that if I made you feel loved and cared for, it could help us work out your insecurity. 
 Over my friendship with Lea. 
 Aww, Shaun. 
 You don't have to do any more research. 
 I am fine with you and Lea being friends. 
 But you can keep making me eggs anytime you want. 
 You're late. 
 I made Carly a special breakfast this morning. 
 And then she wanted to have sex. 
 So we did. 
 That's great, Shaun. 
 Next time, feel free just to say you missed the bus. 
 Women don't like it when you kiss and tell. 
 Even though they do it all the time. 
 Not at work. 
 Apparently, you've never been in the nurses' break room. 
 What were you doing in there? 
 Delivering the donuts. 
 Best lesson I learned as a cop, better to feed down than kiss up. 
 Oh, it's my fault we haven't started our rounds. 
 I missed the bus. 
 It's all right. 
 I'm glad you're all here. 
 Because I want to apologize. 
 Dr. Lim told me she received a complaint about me playing favorites. 
 She obviously didn't reveal any names, but I want to assure you all that I don't have any favorites. 
 And if I did anything to give that impression, it's my mistake. 
 It won't happen again. 
 We're a team. 
 And we need to be able to communicate and trust each other in order to be our best. 
 So in the future, if you have any concerns, you can come to me directly. 
 Absolutely. 
 She got blindsided, never saw it coming. 
 Thank God a woman driving by had pepper spray in her purse, or the dog would've k*lled her. 
 - Brave woman. 
 - Loosen the tourniquet.

 Okay. 
 We need an OR stat.

 Best 10 bucks you'll ever spend. 
 Cory's upper trachea never fully developed in the womb. 
 His upper airway is totally blocked, and he has no larynx at all. 
 The trach tube he needs to breathe continues to cause reoccurring infections and pneumonias. 
 He says it tickles when you touch his neck. 
 Sorry. 
 Not much I can do about that, but I'll try to make it quick. 
 Why are you signing? 
 He's mute, but he's not deaf. 
 It helps us stay mindful of what he's going through. 
 What did he say? 
 He says when we get mad, we don't sign We yell. 
 And when we play soccer together. 
 So keep your room clean and pass your dad the ball every once in a while, and then they won't have to yell. 
 The good news is his lungs are clear and I don't see any sign of infection. 
 Thank God. 
 The better news is he's a good candidate for the surgery we discussed. 
 Yes, it seems a bit experimental. 
 It's shown great results. 
 If we can excise the scar tissue and open up the airway, he still won't be able to talk, but he'll finally be able to breathe normally. 
 It's a complicated procedure, but given the severity of the infections he's been dealing with, I think it's definitely the best option. 
 He says he'll do anything to get rid of the tube sticking out of his neck. 
 And you two? 
 Okay, now you're the one yelling. 
 We hear you. 
 What do you think? 
 Let's do it. 
 Fran? 
 Fran, I'm Dr. 
 Melendez. 
 This is Doctors Park and Browne. 
 You were att*cked by a dog, almost bled to death. 
 You remember? 
 Yes. 
 We had to repair a severed artery in your arm. 
 So, am I okay now? 
 The surgery went well. 
 Dr. 
 Park. 
 We were able to stop the bleeding, which had caused you to go into shock. 
 But we still need to go back in, stabilize the shattered bone, repair nerve damage, and do skin and tissue grafts. 
 But after that? 
 I'm a firefighter. 
 I need my full strength. 
 With plenty of physical therapy, we should be able to get you pretty close. 
 It must be hard for him to communicate. 
 My friend's 12-year-old daughter took a signing class at summer camp. 
 She picked it up pretty fast. 
 Non-verbal communication is definitely more confusing. 
 That's why Carly and I always talk out our problems. 
 Sorry to break it to you, Murphy, but it doesn't matter how explicitly Carly speaks. 
 She's saying a lot more silently. 
 And it's often the opposite of what she said out loud. 
 Why would Carly lie? 
 It's not lying. 
 It's communicating indirectly. 
 Everyone does it, but women way more than men. 
 Most of the time, we don't realize it. 
 That sounds sexist. 
 You gonna report me to HR or listen and learn? 
 Has she ever told you that she didn't want to have sex because she had a headache? 
 No. 
 And I thought you didn't want to hear about my sex life. 
 Fine. 
 But if you ever get the feeling she's upset about something and she insists nothing's wrong, something's wrong. 
 Humerus isn't broken. 
 It's pulverized. 
 Who do you think complained to Lim? 
 No idea. 
 And we're gonna need internal fixation with locked intramedullary nailing to stabilize the fractured pieces. 
 It must be Morgan. 
 She's always looking for a competitive advantage. 
 Let's focus on the patient. 
 You can start your whistleblower investigation as soon as we're done. 
 How does she expect us to trust her if whenever something doesn't go her way, she just goes to the boss It wasn't Morgan. 
 It was me. 
 Why? 
 You're the least competitive of all of us. 
 That's not true, and I didn't do it to help me, I did it to help you. 
 If people see you're getting special treatment, even if it's not your fault, they'll resent you. 
 I'm not getting special treatment. 
 And I don't need your protection. 
 Fine. 
 My mistake. 
 So you can yell at me or we can get back to work. 
 Just what the doctor ordered. 
 - W-W-What? 
 - You. 
 I need a double dose of Shaunie, stat. 
 Glassy is driving me crazy. 
 What is it with old people and technology? 
 Hmm. 
 Don't worry. 
 I just need to vent for a minute. 
 And I'll scram if Carly comes. 
 It's okay. 
 I think Carly's not insecure about you anymore. 
 Really? 
 That's awesome. 
 I added the ""I think"" because Morgan thinks women sometimes say the opposite of what they think. 
 But I don't think Carly would hide what she thinks. 
 What do you think? 
 Nobody always says what they think. 
 So Morgan's right? 
 Except for the sexist part? 
 No. 
 I think Carly is very in tune to how you communicate. 
 If she was unhappy, I'm sure she wouldn't hide it. 
 Yes. 
 I agree. 
 Lunch is over. 
 We have a surgery to do. 
 Hey, Morgan. 
 Love your boots. 
 Thanks. 
 Love your sweater. 
 Thanks. 
 DR. 
 - Nice work. 
 Look at that. 
 On the bone. 
 Teeth marks. 
 Must've been a huge dog. 
 During ""no knock"" searches, I was more afraid of dogs than g*ns. 
 Gangsters have horrible aim, but their dogs never miss the target Which was our crotches. 
 Damn. 
 How many times they get ahold of you? 
 Never. 
 Another benefit of martial arts training. 
 You kicked the dogs? 
 Like I needed a 60-yard field goal to win the Super Bowl. 
 That's awful. 
 It's self-defense. 
 Totally. 
 I need 9-oh nylon microsutures. 
 Next step is to suture in the interposition graft. 
 Dr. 
 Park's doing great. 
 Might as well continue. 
 I I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty. 
 Let's see how Park does with this first. 
 Make sure your stay sutures are at six and twelve o'clock. 
 You are very efficient. 
 And you're very clever, introing your insult with a compliment. 
 Your ""helping me out"" appears to have conveniently helped you out. 
 Eh, I was expecting worse. 
 Melendez is bending over backwards to avoid anything that might convey the slightest bit of appreciation for my work. 
 Because it couldn't possibly be that I was actually doing a better job than you. 
 Right. 
 You're probably buying him donuts, too. 
 I did what I thought needed to be done, and you're accomplishing nothing by continuing to badger me about it. 
 Thanks, Dad. 
 You're welcome, child. 
 The boy's obstructed cricotracheal segment looks bigger than what we saw on imaging. 
 I chose to be aggressive with resection. 
 Murphy, flex the neck to mobilize the ends and reduce tension on the anastomosis. 
 Are you sure we're gonna be able to cinch it closed? 
 Not ""we. 
 "" You. 
 Step on up. 
 Four-oh vicryl sutures on a needle driver. 
 Place lateral traction sutures at the proximal and distal airway. 
 - You all right? 
 - Yeah, it's just, I I hit my finger with a hammer last night. 
 I was trying to hang a painting. 
 Murphy, take over. 
 It's all right. 
 I can Move. 
 You're a surgeon, not a hockey player. 
 We don't play through our injuries. 
 Next time, hire a handyman. 
 Those fingers are your livelihood. 
 Got it. 
 I know Carly says she's not jealous anymore, but based on what I saw at lunch, I'm thinking maybe she should be. 
 I think Murphy's old enough to handle his own girlfriend trouble. 
 I don't have any girlfriend trouble. 
 That ""eating off the plate"" move is the oldest trick in the book. 
 Lea was hungry. 
 It looked more like she was claiming territory than satisfying hunger. 
 She might as well have peed on your leg. 
 You, shut up. 
 And you, keep a smaller gap between the sutures. 
 We're gonna need a solid anchor to get the anastomosis airtight. 
 That's better. 
 Good job. 
 - Good work today. 
 - Thanks. 
 See you tomorrow at the track. 
 I, uh I I wanted to talk to you about that. 
 We can't do this anymore. 
 It's just a run on a public track. 
 It's not like we're meeting at a hotel. 
 I just shouldn't be socializing with residents outside of work. 
 Any of you. 
 Neil. 
 I've been going through a tough time. 
 Our friendship, having someone I can talk to, it helps. 
 I'm not abandoning you. 
 I'll be there to support you at work. 
 You've got your therapist. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 This is exactly why women have such a hard time finding mentors. 
 No one questions when guys hang out, but anytime a woman wants to build a totally appropriate relationship with a male colleague, the stupid rumors start. 
 I agree. 
 But the rumors have started. 
 I'm gonna plug the trach tube, and I want you to try to take a breath. 
 Nice and easy. 
 He says it hurts, but it's the best feeling he's ever had. 
 What's wrong? 
 You don't like it? 
 It's delicious. 
 I hear delicious, but I see disappointed. 
 It's not the chicken. 
 It's my patient. 
 We fixed his airway, and he can breathe without the trach now. 
 That's fantastic. 
 But he still can't talk. 
 He can talk. 
 He just does it with his hands. 
 Mm, but only with people who can also sign, and they have to be looking at him, and Well, could you do a cadaveric larynx transplant? 
 No. 
 I've heard that's worked for some throat cancer patients. 
 No, Dr. 
 Lim ruled that out years ago. 
 The risk of tissue rejection is too great in a child his age. 
 Well, could you wait till he's older? 
 No! 
 If he doesn't learn to speak soon, he'll never be able to. 
 Okay. 
 I need to do some reading. 
 Oh, come on, Shaun. 
 You should at least eat something first. 
 No. 
 I'm hungry, but I will do the reading first. 
 You're in early. 
 What's the haps? 
 Are you serious? 
 I didn't even know Michelle Obama was in SEAL Team Six. 
 Have you ever noticed how Glassy grinds his teeth when he's listening to someone talk? 
 It's like a cow chewing on You never used to do that. 
 Do what? 
 Eat food off my plate. 
 I used to work full time at a place with private chefs. 
 Now I work part time in a place with hard-boiled eggs in a vending machine. 
 She said it's like you're peeing on my leg. 
 You're gonna have to expand on that. 
 Morgan thinks your body language says you're trying to assert your dominance over Carly. 
 Morgan is one twisted biatch. 
 Is she right? 
 No. 
 Not even close. 
 I promise you my voice and body language are communicating the same thing, which is pure, non-threatening, platonic friendship. 
 Shaun? 
 He also snores. 
 Really loud. 
 - Glassman? 
 - Oh! 
 I have to go! 
 Okay. 
 Incision sites look good. 
 And skin and tissue grafts appear to be taking hold nicely. 
 We were able to reattach your bicep muscle and tendon. 
 That's good to hear. 
 Can you lift your arm? 
 No. 
 I I can't. 
 Because it hurts too much? 
 It doesn't hurt at all. 
 I figured that was because of the pain meds. 
 You feel that? 
 No. 
 Vocal cords aren't the only way a person can create sounds with their mouth. 
 You want the kid to learn to burp his way through his conversation? 
 Mm, I don't think it would be possible to sustain enough air output to It was a joke, Murphy. 
 Oh. 
 Snoring is a better model anyway. 
 Soft palate tissue is what vibrates, making the sound when people snore, but it's not stiff enough to replace the vocal cords. 
 But we could use his own costal cartilage to act as vocal cords. 
 The larynx is a complicated piece of anatomy. 
 Basically, a tiny musical instrument. 
 We can remove two of his ribs to create the anterior and posterior larynx frame and then stretch the cartilage across it. 
 And then cut open a trachea we worked so hard to close? 
 We could destroy everything we just fixed. 
 Yes. 
 I think it's worth the risk. 
 Because you're thinking the kid's like you, that he needs to speak out loud to be understood. 
 She's right. 
 The larynx is like a musical instrument. 
 But if Bo Diddley can make a guitar out of a cigar box, I'm pretty sure I can make a larynx from bone and cartilage. 
 Absolutely not. 
 He's finally healthy. 
 There's no need to take any more risks. 
 You're right. 
 There are definitely risks. 
 But I wouldn't present the option if I didn't think we could manage them. 
 Couldn't we just wait until he's a few years older? 
 I assume the stronger he is, the safer it is. 
 Most verbal language development happens within the first eight years of a child's life. 
 Cory's already 10. 
 It we wait any longer, he may not be able to learn to speak, even with a larynx. 
 He can communicate without speaking. 
 You're making a big mistake. 
 Murphy. 
 He'll always be Limited. 
 It'll be difficult to make friends, to interact with strangers. 
 Murphy. 
 That's enough. 
 They're aware of their options, and they've made their decision. 
 The suture repair looks fine. 
 Which makes me think the nerve here got compressed between the bone and the dog's teeth. 
 It's too wide a span to repair with a graft. 
 What if we built a nerve conduit out of silicone and polyglycolide? 
 We could use it to guide the severed nerve ends to grow toward each other, create a pathway for them to connect and heal. 
 I'm not sure the nerves can grow across that distance. 
 It's definitely worth a try. 
 We can't just experiment on her, like a lab rat. 
 And we can't just sit back and do nothing. 
 I'm not saying we should do nothing. 
 I'm just saying we can't experiment on her blindly. 
 Maybe we could use donor tissue to bridge the gap. 
 Well, that means putting the patient on a transplant list. 
 Who knows how long it would take before she gets a viable donation? 
 The firehouse won't hold her position until she heals. 
 She'd lose her job. 
 Well, first, you want to treat her like a guinea pig, and now you're deeply concerned about her life experience. 
 You just want to be right. 
 And you don't? 
 Are you gonna step in at any point? 
 I think Park's idea has the best chance of success. 
 Get her prepped. 
 Did you really think his idea is better, or do you just not want to look like you're biased toward me? 
 I'm not happy about this situation either, but I think you're overreacting. 
 You better get it under control, or you're gonna find yourself watching from the gallery. 
 - Hi. 
 - Hey. 
 Do you have a problem with me staying friends with Shaun? 
 I know you've told him you're fine with it, but are you? 
 Yes. 
 Really? 
 I mean, I'm totally glad you are. 
 It's great. 
 But I'm not sure I would be if I were in your shoes. 
 If it was any other guy, I probably wouldn't be. 
 But Shaun, he always tells the truth. 
 So when he told me that he's not interested in you, I believe him. 
 Okay. 
 You told the residents not to come to me? 
 No. 
 That's not at all what I said. 
 You didn't tell them, ""Next time you have a problem, come to me directly""? 
 I was encouraging open communication and trust on my team. 
 What I have is a group of ambitious young residents who are struggling to figure out how to be cooperative as well as competitive. 
 You're not helping them figure it out by suggesting they resist taking complaints up the chain of command. 
 I'm sorry you've had to waste your time dealing with this, but there really isn't Neil, I am not wasting my time. 
 You do have an issue. 
 And you've got to stop pretending you don't. 
 The incision is healing nicely. 
 We should be able to discharge you today. 
 Are you happy to be going home? 
 Do you have any questions for us? 
 Are you sure? 
 Because you don't really seem all that happy to be going home. 
 What is he saying? 
 He said Dr. 
 Murphy was right. 
 He does have a hard time talking to kids at school. 
 And making friends. 
 He doesn't want people to ignore him or act like he's stupid anymore. 
 Honey, I'm so sorry. 
 Okay. 
 May the good Lord shine a light on you Make every song your favorite tune May the good Lord shine a light on you Warm like the evening sun That's two segments from the seventh rib. 
 Let's close his chest. 
 Angels beating all their wings in time Reznick, I need you to secure the posterior surface while I place PDS four-oh sutures. 
 Murphy, be ready to suture the graft into the anterior section. 
 Morgan realized our patient wasn't happy, even though he said he was. 
 If she hadn't been there, we wouldn't be doing this surgery. 
 It wouldn't have mattered what I was able to realize if you hadn't been so obsessed about finding a new surgery to help the patient. 
 Blood pressure's plummeting. 
 The field is filling with blood. 
 I can't see the source. 
 Murphy, expose the external carotid and find the superior thyroid. 
 BP still dropping. 
 Heart rate is up. 
 Place a temporary clamp on it, Reznick. 
 It's not working. 
 This is venous. 
 10 blade. 
 I see what happened. 
 Left and right jugular veins are connected by a venous arc we injured during retraction. 
 Dr. 
 Murphy, just double ligate with two-oh silk ties on both ends. 
 Silk ties. 
 He's stabilizing. 
 Good job. 
 Both of you. 
 Congratulations. 
 It's not every day you get to build a kid a brand-new larynx. 
 It was very exciting. 
 Was I on your mind? 
 Was I on your mind? 
 Those two are getting pregnant tonight. 
 Yeah. 
 They should get a room. 
 So they can make out in private. 
 Oh, my God. 
 It's Lea. 
 She's not getting pregnant. 
 She definitely uses protection. 
 Every time one of her boyfriends would come over, - she She would - That's okay. 
 I don't need the details. 
 Would you ever be comfortable making out in public like that? 
 Hmm. 
 I don't know. 
 As a board-certified pathologist, I think we need to conduct an experiment. 
 Okay. 
 You were in my dream last night Creepin' in again When I least expect Shaunie! 
 I can't believe you're here! 
 Is this what 22 feels like? 
 Do you feel 10 blade. 
 Transverse incision approach to the brachial plexus. 
 Adson forceps. 
 I can assist with ligating the traversing external jugular branches. 
 I could divide the omohyoid muscle. 
 It's all right. 
 Probably best for me to handle this. 
 Retracting to the side. 
 Sister, won't you listen? 
 I don't wanna love the one who lies And I can hear him whisper 'Bout the things you did in days gone by I'm sorry. 
 I think we k*lled the mood. 
 No! 
 Mm. 
 You did manage to wound it pretty bad. 
 It's bleeding out. 
 Yes. 
 It's a joke, Shaun. 
 See, what Carly did was I get it. 
 I get it. 
 She anthropomorphized the word ""mood"" to make it seem like you hurt it and it's now hemorrhaging. 
 It's very clever. 
 Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom Boom, badoom, boom, bass? 
 He got that super bass Boom, badoom, boom Boom, badoom, boom, bass Yeah, that's that super bass This one's for the boys in the polos All your Marcos and the moguls He could ball with the crew, he could solo But I think I like him better when he dolo And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on He ain't even gotta try to put the mack on He just gotta give me that look When he give me that look Then the panties comin' off, off, oh Excuse me, you're a hell of a guy I I Mean, sigh, sickening eyes I can tell you're in touch with your feminine side Oh, yes, I did, yes, I did Please, someone, who the heck I is I am Nicki Minaj, I mack dudes up Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up!

 It was fun last night. 
 I'm glad you and Lea are friends. 
 Yeah. 
 What was your favorite song? 
 Mine was Whip It. 
 I have to go. 
 I have an early morning. 
 Okay. 
 I will see you at work. 
 You're at 60 meters per second. 
 Normal electrical signal velocity of the nerve is 50-65. 
 That's good? 
 Very. 
 The surgery worked. 
 Your strength might go down a bit, but you definitely should get function back. 
 How can I thank you? 
 Seriously. 
 Well, actually, uh, it's Dr. 
 Melendez you should thank. 
 He did the surgery. 
 We didn't really do anything. 
 Well, you obviously did something. 
 Okay. 
 You're welcome. 
 Get some rest. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Any pain or discomfort? 
 Good. 
 If you're feeling up to it, we'd like you to try to make a sound. 
 Now, start down here and just push the air up. 
 Be gentle. 
 We don't need you breaking any wine glasses just yet. 
 That's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard. 
 It's just a primitive sound. 
 With speech therapy, he'll be able to fully speak. 
 Cory says thank you, Dr. 
 Murphy, for pushing for the surgery. 
 This is the best day of his life. 
 You are very welcome. 
 This is not you. 
 And it's not right. 
 We can be friends and have it not be weird. 
 It's already weird. 
 I'm not gonna stay. 
 Well, you don't have to run away just because I'm here. 
 I'm not running. 
 I'm being professional. 
 You're overcompensating. 
 Trying to play it safe. 
 And it's It's hurting things. 
 It got Park and I in an argument. 
 That's not how I want to be mentored. 
 That's not who you are. 
 At least, it's not who I thought you were. 
 Enjoy your dinner. 
 I'm confused. 
 One day, you're filing a complaint about your boss. 
 The next, you're being incredibly nice and supportive to your fellow resident. 
 I told you, I just felt like Dr. 
 Melendez's treatment of Browne was starting to cause dissension on the team. 
 I have no doubt that's part of the truth. 
 I'm guessing the other part was Preemptive. 
 You thought it would inoculate you. 
 We'd never be able to fire someone who filed a formal complaint against their attending. 
 Which is why I'm so confused. 
 Why would you feel like your job could be in jeopardy? 
 I don't. 
 I don't know what you're talking about. 
 Okay. 
 Just so you're clear I won't hesitate to let you or anyone else go if I feel it's deserved. 
 No matter whether they've filed a complaint or not. 
 Of course. 
 I understand that. 
 Good. 
 Have a good night. 
 Thanks. 
 Two menus. 
 I'm going to make you a surprise dinner tonight. 
 It's a special grilled cheese sandwich. 
 It's special because it uses four kinds of cheeses Gruyere, Parmesan, yellow I don't think that we should be together anymore. 
 Hmm? 
 I can't be your girlfriend anymore. 
 Did Did I do something wrong? 
 No, Shaun. 
 It's not Last night at karaoke, when you and Lea were singing together, there was something between you two. 
 You love her, not me. 
 No. 
 N-No. 
 No. 
 I don't. 
 It's obvious. 
 You're wrong. 
 You say that. 
 And maybe you even believe it. 
 But I saw what I saw, Shaun, and I am telling you, it doesn't matter what you say. 
 It's true. 
 And I think she loves you, too. 
 You should tell her how you feel."

 No to both.

 I thought you two were doing great. 
 We were. 
 Then I guess we weren't. 
 Cross-clamping. 
 You must really be hurting? 
 N-No. 
 I'm fine. 
 We've all been through it.

 Jane shouldn't have died not then, not like that. 
 Her carotids blew out. 
 What am I missing? 
 Patients die, Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 That's something else we have to own. 
 Your next patient's waiting in the E. R. 
 How are you feeling, Aiden? 
 Awesome considering whatever you did to me. 
 Mm. 
 Surgery went well. 
 Hey, I'm alive, doped up, talking to two very attractive doctors. 
 I guess this is what happens when you mix weed with my skateboarding skills. 
 You said you didn't do dr*gs. 
 Or skateboard. 
 When did I say that? 
 When we met you in the E. R. 
 I've never seen you guys before in my life. 
 Trust me, I'd remember. 
 I'd like to order an autopsy on Jane. 
 We went over this there was nothing suspicious about her death. 
 Oh, I was asking the Chief of Surgery. 
 I know the case, and I agree with Dr. 
 Melendez. 
 I'm not authorizing an autopsy. 
 Jane's vascular walls It's hard to lose a patient. 
 Almost as hard as losing a girlfriend. 
 I'm okay, and I don't know why no one believes me isn't it okay to be okay? 
 Not when something bad happens. 
 We should feel hurt. 
 If you won't approve the autopsy, I'll get it from Jane's family. 
 Good luck with that. 
 According to the files, Jane's last name was Doe. 
 Y-You're saying I'm having some kind of blackouts? 
 Which could be caused by head trauma or drug use. 
 I'm definitely aware of telling you that I don't take dr*gs. 
 I live like a monk sleep, class, study, repeat. 
 That's it. 
 You've also told us the exact opposite. 
 I need to find Jane's family to get their permission to perform an autopsy. 
 Dr. Lim wished me luck, but Jane has no I. D. , no purse, no phone. 
 We know absolutely nothing about her. 
 Mm. 
 This should be interesting to you. 
 You used to be a detective. 
 And now I'm a doctor, and so are you, and we both have a new case. 
 A boring case. 
 He has gallstones. 
 So, you and Melendez sneaking around again? 
 I hear he's back to being a good mentor. 
 Apparently, my complaint changed nothing. 
 You? 
 Park said he did it. 
 Park was lying. 
 Because he wanted to get you to focus on work. 
 Good motive, bad judge of character. 
 And you don't like that Melendez has gone back to being a good mentor? 
 I don't like that he likes you. 
 I don't like that, because he likes you, Shaun, Park, and I are second-class residents. 
 For someone as cynical as you are, you are shockingly naive. 
 I'll tell you what you did. 
 You threw a b*mb because you felt slighted. 
 You made Melendez doubt himself, doubt his judgment. 
 You made him resent you, Park, Shaun, and me. 
 I like to think it's that easy to change the status quo. 
 But I am pretty naive. 
 I am with Dr. 
 B on this. 
 Sorry. 
 Office politics. 
 Thought you were asleep. 
 Watching brain waves can't be too thrilling. 
 Not when they're as normal as yours. 
 Hmm. 
 Except these delta waves. 
 They mean you're still asleep. 
 Not planning on doing any cutting, I hope. 
 Jane had a knee replacement using an LCS system, which means it's at least 30 years old. 
 She also had an abnormal number of cavities, crowns, and implants. 
 These are clues, right? 
 I don't think this is about you losing a patient. 
 I think you're distracting yourself. 
 You don't want to let Jane go because you don't want to let Carly go. 
 Hmm. 
 What? 
 You're a doctor now. 
 You won't find it interesting. 
 Hmm. 
 A hummingbird. 
 Am I right? 
 The police keep a database of all distinguishing marks. 
 Jane Doe, homeless there's no way she was never in the system How's Mr. 
 Ginley? 
 Your gallbladder case you should be working on? 
 Uh, we confirmed the presence of gallstones and have scheduled a cholecystectomy. 
 It's a very simple case and requires no work. 
 With that attitude, you could end up sending another patient to the morgue. 
 Focus on the living. 
 He's right. 
 We need to bail on this. 
 Hey, Shaun. 
 You and Carly shared a lot of firsts. 
 That must make it harder to move on. 
 I had a lot of firsts with Lea, too. 
 Yeah, you did. 
 And you moved on. 
 Didn't you? 
 How do you move on? 
 Hmm. 
 Hey, Kenny, I need a name. 
 We need to keep this on the DL. 
 We're going undercover. 
 Causes of sleepwalking run the gamut from the serious, like MS, encephalitis, and brain tumors, to the mundane, like alcohol and drug use, poor sleep hygiene, and stress. 
 Problem is, to rule some of those out, we need a full patient history, but AsleepAiden and AwakeAiden each have their own story. 
 So interview them both. 
 Take a medical history from a patient when they're asleep? 
 I've never heard of a lying sleepwalker. 
 I got to go. 
 Hey! 
 Stress? 
 I have to maintain a 4. 2 GPA. 
 W-What do you think? 
 You have to care about something to be stressed, don't you? 
 And since I'm getting a 4. 2 without trying Maybe a glass of wine at a party. 
 I just microdose you know, whenever I'm not macrodosing. 
 Do you nap, exercise before bedtime? 
 I never nap, I work out five days a week never too close to bedtime, which is midnight, 12:30 at the latest. 
 I am surrounded by 5,000 women. 
 Yes, right before bedtime. 
 That explains the headaches I've been waking up with.

 Shaun Murphy, and I recently treated your mother, Maribel. 
 She died on the operating table. 
 I would like your permission to do an autopsy. 
 We're very sorry for your loss. 
 She came in with a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and there wasn't much we could do. 
 But we would like to be absolutely certain about her cause of death. 
 I don't care how she died. 
 Remember we talked about moving on? 
 This is the time to do that. 
 Where do we stand with the Aidens? 
 Between the two alters, they engage in just about every single behavior. 
 So, we go back to Dr. 
 Lim's list. 
 Maybe we should be looking at paraneoplastic syndromes. 
 May want to consider psychiatric issues could be having psychotic or dissociative episodes. 
 I have a fair amount of personal experience with people with psychiatric issues. 
 If he had psychosis, I'd have picked up on it. 
 How about thyrotoxicosis? 
 No irritability, agitation. 
 Paraneoplastic syndromes trigger a loss of coordination, which could have caused Actually, our personal experiences make us less effective in spotting symptoms. 
 You know I always make an effort to be as objective as possible. 
 Well, you're not this time. 
 The vast majority of cases of paraneoplastic syndromes present with antibodies. 
 His labs show a normal serum panel. 
 The ""vast majority"" of all diseases don't present with competing entities day and night. 
 - I'm just giving an idea. 
 - No, you're undermining mine. 
 Fine. 
 Your idea's brilliant. 
 Go waste your time on it. 
 Thank you both. 
 Get an MRI to rule out brain tumors and MS, an LP for encephalitis, and a CSF panel to check for paraneoplastic syndromes. 
 And a psych consult. 
 No. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Dr. Lim. 
 And you are? 
 Trinity. 
 Where are your parents? 
 My mother's in the maternity ward. 
 She's having a baby? 
 Already did. 
 A girl. 
 Wonderful. 
 So, why the wandering? 
 My mom sent me to the cafeteria to get a snack, but I got lost. 
 Three times? 
 Hey, Lucy. 
 We're looking for, um Trinity! 
 Please call security. 
 Stop the car. 
 No. 
 Yes. 
 Shaun! 
 Shaun! 
 I need your permission! 
 Don't do this, Shaun! 
 No! 
 - I need your permission! 
 - Let it go, Shaun! 
 It can't be over! 
 - It can't be over! 
 - It's over! 
 You have to let Carly go! 
 - No! 
 No! 
 - You have to let Carly go! 
 - No!

 Well, it's not about this, either!

 Shaun, he's calling the police!

 - No! 
 - Shaun! 
 Open the Oh, my God. 
 Shaun, are you okay? 
 It was bad. 
 I missed my surgery. 
 Well, don't worry about that. 
 Park's there. 
 Everything there is fine. 
 Will I have to go back to jail? 
 No. 
 No. 
 It's a good thing you were with an ex-cop. 
 The guy's not gonna press any charges, but you're not allowed to be anywhere near him ever again. 
 Here. 
 Let's get out of here, huh? 
 Park says that you are upset about Carly. 
 Everyone keeps telling me that, but I am not upset about Carly, and they need to stop. 
 Okay, so, this isn't about Carly. 
 I wish Carly didn't break up with me. 
 But she did. 
 And now I have to do what she said. 
 What do you mean you have to do what she said? 
 She doesn't get to dictate to you. 
 She told me to tell Lea I love her. 
 Oh. 
 O-Oh. 
 And you're afraid of what might happen if you told Lea the truth? 
 If I tell her I love her and she tells me she doesn't, then I can't be her boyfriend. 
 And even worse, I I don't think I can be her friend, either. 
 And what if Lea were to say ""You know what, Shaun? 
 I love you, too""? 
 Hmm. 
 Pretty disturbing, having this weird personality creeping out of me. 
 Does he represent something I'm suppressing and need to express or something I need to bury forever? 
 If it's any consolation, I kind of like him. 
 I think he's just trying to enjoy himself. 
 Except he's sabotaging all the hard work of his waking self. 
 It's not sabotage. 
 It's just a part of who he is. 
 Some parts of who we are suck. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I shouldn't have ratted on you and Melendez. 
 I screwed things up. 
 But this guy needs a drink every now and again. 
 You see that? 
 Yeah. 
 You have an arachnoid cyst compressing your hypothalamus, Aiden. 
 We basically just need to drain it. 
 W-Will it k*ll me if you don't? 
 He knows the risks? 
 He knows it won't k*ll him, which is enough for Jekyll to decide to keep Hyde alive. 
 What if we ask Hyde? 
 I'm pretty sure consent needs to be informed, voluntary, and conscious. 
 It also doesn't matter. 
 AsleepAiden's a hedonist. 
 He's not gonna make a decision against his interest just to help his alter. 
 Maybe he cares more than you think. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Lim? 
 Thank you. 
 Trinity, have a seat. 
 There's no one in our maternity ward with a daughter named Trinity. 
 So, I'm gonna need some information, and it will be much more efficient if it's the truth. 
 First and last name. 
 Trinity. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Last name? 
 Okay. 
 Will you at least tell me what you're doing in this hospital? 
 I just wanted to meet you again. 
 Someone left a baby girl at the E. R. about eight years ago, on Trinity Sunday. 
 You were so tiny, so sick, and so helpless. 
 k*lled me not to take you home. 
 But look at you now, so strong and healthy. 
 And fast. 
 You know we need to call your mother and let her know where you are. 
 That you're okay. 
 You know her number? 
 Yes, but But? 
 Can you adopt me? 
 Shaunie. 
 You poor thing. 
 I'm so sorry about you and Carly. 
 I want to tell you how I feel. 
 I know you're hurting. 
 Carly made a huge mistake. 
 You're a wonderful man, Shaun. 
 Maybe the most wonderful man I've ever met. 
 Lea? 
 Yeah, Shaun? 
 I found that in my mother's drawer. 
 Does she know you're here? 
 She's been in Campbell Memorial for the last two days. 
 She thinks I've been in school and at a friend's. 
 As long as I'm home by 6:00, no one knows the difference. 
 Mm, well, it's past that. 
 I'm sure she's worried. 
 She has a new daughter. 
 It's hard to share your mom, isn't it? 
 If she loves your sister with all her heart, it doesn't feel like it'd leave much room for you. 
 Do you love your mom with all your heart? 
 How about your dad? 
 You love him with all your heart, too? 
 But that doesn't seem possible, does it? 
 Hearts are amazing things. 
 I've held one in my hands many times. 
 You'd never know it by looking at them, but somehow they have all the room we need. 
 Dr. B. 
 Please tell me you're single. 
 You have a cyst in your brain. 
 If we leave it as is, it could expose you to considerable neurological complications potential visual loss, endocrine abnormalities, depression. 
 But if we drain and treat the cyst, there should be no complications. 
 Including sleepwalking. 
 The Professor already rejected treatment? 
 So you're asking the Frat Boy to fall on his sword for him? 
 I think the Frat Boy is more than just a Frat Boy. 
 We're all complicated. 
 We're all sometimes superficial, selfish jerks. 
 But we're also capable of sacrifice. 
 I think you live in him the same way he lives in you. 
 And that won't change, no matter what decision you make. 
 Shaun. 
 Maribel died. 
 I think she had polycystic kidney disease, which is associated with dilation of the arteries, which results in weakened vascular walls, which in turn contributes to the formation of aneurysms. 
 I need to do an autopsy. 
 Dr. Melendez Didn't approve. 
 Dr. Lim didn't approve. 
 - The family said no. 
 - So, what can I You're the head of pathology. 
 Shaun, I'm not going to I can't do what you told me I should do. 
 Until I solve this distraction. 
 No sign of polycystic kidney disease. 
 I know that this break-up has been hard on you. 
 It's been hard on me, too. 
 But I know what I saw between you and Lea. 
 I did see something, didn't I? 
 I love you, Carly. 
 But you were right. 
 I love Lea more. 
 Okay. 
 So you know you have to tell her, right? 
 I'm scared. 
 I know. 
 But look at how far you've come with me how scared you were. 
 How brave you were. 
 I have to go. 
 Thank you, Carly. 
 If you're watching this, it means I'm dead. 
 And you're waking up from a surgery you think you didn't consent to, but I hereby proffer my full and informed consent to said surgical procedure. 
 Signed Aiden Michael Porter. 
 The second. 
 Uh, just one one more thing. 
 My advice is to try to chillax a little. 
 Neither of us is perfect. 
 But we're okay. 
 We are gonna be Okay. 
 And that girl who sits in front of you in Advanced Calculus, her name is Staci with an ""I,"" and she likes you. 
 Way more than she likes me. 
 Peace out Professor. 
 You're kidding me, right? 
 I know why your mother died.

 When we met, you were in an ambulance and your arms were still in your harvester. 
 Today you have sensation and almost full mobility. 
 Now we just need to treat the neuropathy and improve your strength. 
 So how do we do that? 
 I'm thinking a gracilis muscle transfer. 
 That should improve his grip and relieve some of the pain, but there's only one way to eliminate all of it. 
 Tyson, have you given any more thought to amputation and osseointegrated prosthetic arms? 
 They'd attach directly to the bones and nerves in your forearm, and you can control them just like your own hands. 
 Function would be reduced in some respects. 
 Less dexterity, no sensory feedback. 
 But others, like grip strength, would be better. 
 And more importantly, you'd be pain-free. 
 I want to be a farmer, not a cyborg. 
 Okay. 
 The pain's getting worse.

 The treatment is the same. 
 Surgery to create more room in the skull base. 
 It's not the same, and stop interrupting me. 
 If we drill off the C  in the front, as well as open the back, we might not have to resect the cerebellum. 
 He wouldn't have any speech impediment or balance issues.

 Colleen Brown. 
 Freshman year. 
 I took her to the roller-skating rink 
 'cause I thought that's what you're supposed to do... take girls to the roller-skating rink. 
 I didn't know how to roller-skate; she ended up leaving with Bobby K.'s little brother. 
 Broke me up. [SIGHS] 
 Couldn't go to school for a week. 
 Convinced my mom that I was sick for the first three days, and the last two I spent in a double feature all day... 
 ""Where's Poppa?"" and ""Twelve Chairs."" 
 To this day, I can quote both films verbatim. 
 So you think I should've stayed home for two more days? 
 No, I don't think it would've mattered. 
 It doesn't make a difference. 
 And then I made a list of all the things that annoyed me about her. 
 The way she chewed her gum, the way she used to sit in the front row of every class so that the teacher would call on her when she raised her hand, the way she said, ""Excuse me?""   instead of just ""What?"" or ""Huh?"" 
 None of it makes any difference. 
 Then why are you telling me? 
 Maybe it'll make you feel a little bit better to know that, what you're going through, every other young man in the history of the world has gone through.

 No, no, I don't... 
 I don't want that at all. 
 But I don't want to feel like this, either. 
 I want this to be over. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, we all want it to be over, Shaun. 
 I mean, we're... 
 we're sick of ourselves, we're sick of each other, or we're pining for someone we can't be with. 
 We're confused. 
 We're uncomfortable. 
 And on top of everything else, we're scared that the world will never be the same again. 
 I mean, I don't know, Shaun. 
 I don't have a map for this kind of thing. 
 Best I can say is... 
 (SIGHS) 
 Be kind. 
 Be kind to yourself. 
 Be kind     to everyone.

 She was right. 
 I don't even really care about the party that much.

 I wanna know what's bothering you. 
 I... 
 I know your job is important,

 you care about me more than you care about the job. 
 When your Mom got pregnant, I was so nervous. 
 Suddenly, everything was real. 
 Suddenly, I had a commitment. 
 And I wasn't sure I was ready. 
 And then you were born. 
 And in that moment, I mean, that moment, everything changed. 
 I was instantly head-over-heels in love with you. 
 You were my best friend. 
 And, uh, I held you, and the words just came out. 
 I said, ""Hi, buddy.""

 I'd never called anyone ""buddy"" before in my life. 
 But you were my buddy. 
 I may make mistakes over and over again, but don't ever think you're not the most important thing in my life.

 I'm Freddie Highmore. 
 The following episode portrays our hope for the future, a future where no one will have to wear masks or take other steps to stay safe from COVID. 
 Until then, please protect yourself and others. 
 I'm Jordan Allen. 
 My first year in med school, I designed an ankle brace that monitors extent of immobilization via a phone app. 
 When I licensed it to Bioventus, I was able to pay off over half my student loans. 
 John Lundberg. 
 I've worked every summer since I was at Camp Hope Heartland, a summer program for kids with cancer in Des Moines, where I grew up. 
 Asher Wolke. 
 Uh, when I was   , I left the Hasidic community that I was raised in. 
 I realized if there really was a God, it had to be a cruel being    that I felt nothing but contempt for. 
 That's also when I decided to go to med school, and start dating men. 
 I'm Olivia Jackson. 
 I'm   . 
 From Chicago. 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 I play ragtime piano alone in my apartment. 
 Is that interesting? 
 Will Hooper. 
 Technically, I'm a professional athlete. 
 Although in a sport nobody pays attention to, and the stipend barely covers our training expenses, but I'm on the US National Rowing team. 
 Men's Eight. 
 Hey, I'm Enrique. 
 I spent last summer in Costa Rica, where I learned to surf, which I'm totally obsessed with now. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Uh, I had a pretty interesting encounter with a saltwater crocodile. 
 I just thought it was a big... 
 Why are you wearing a swimsuit? 
 Oh, they're actually hybrid boardshorts. 
 I like to work hard,    and it's easier to do when you're comfortable. 
 Plus, I think the casual dress puts patients at ease. 
 (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) 
 Uh... 
 And Dr. Lim said that the shorts were fine. 
 Hospital policy requires all residents to... 
 He's not a resident. 
 He's a resident applicant. 
 One of six finalists for four openings. 
 Now, they'll be shadowing for two days. 
 Give them the grand tour, show them the ropes, feel free to turn up the heat a bit. 
 See how they react under pressure. 
 You will be responsible for supervising them, so I want your totally honest input before I make any final decisions. 
 Those shorts... 
 Let's call them strike one. 
 Oh, and in addition to being an Olympian, Will Hooper is a Rhodes and graduated top of his class at Stanford. 
 He is very handsome. 
 He's very full of himself.

 Just wanted to check in. 
 See how the new role was coming along. 
 Honestly? 
 You could start our new supervisor-resident relationship with a lie. 
 That's always fun. 
 Internal medicine is boring. 
 Between smokers and obese diabetics, seems like all I'm doing is protecting people from themselves. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 As a surgical resident, you never treated drunk drivers? 
 Or extracted random objects from guys'... 
 I get it. 
 People are stupid. 
 Not my point, but true. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Not the same adrenaline rush, but internal medicine can be rewarding. 
 Given time, if you're patient. 
 Thanks. 
 That is 
 not 
 how I thought this meeting was gonna go. 
 I thought one of the nurses complained about me. 
 Wasn't just one. 
 And if it happens again, this meeting will go exactly how you thought it would.

 I should've just canceled the appointment.

 As soon as possible. 
 I appreciate you letting me share your case with the whole class. 
 MONICA: No problem. 
 I stopped being shy after the    th time I had to do this. 
 I'll be using a version of Lejour's technique I've adapted. 
 We'll divide the breast into three pedicles, and then redistribute the tissue and insert saline implants to correct the tuberous breast deformity. 
 Why would you want breast implants? 
 You're beautiful. 
 And your breasts look fine just the way they are. 
 No. 
 No, they don't. 
 The base is constricted, horizontal development is deficient, and the nipple-areola complex... 
 - Murphy. 
 - It's okay. 
 He's right. 
 That's why I'm here. 
 Thank you. 
 I know that you're trying to be nice. 
 My friends and family have been telling me for years, ""You're beautiful just the way you are."" But 
 I 
 don't feel beautiful. 
 You're   . 
 Every girl your age feels like that. 
 That can't be true. 
 Tuberous breast deformity is a rare condition. 
 We're not going to debate a personal decision the patient's already made. 
 I've been thinking about this since I was   . 
 Every time I look in the mirror. 
 I'm about to start college, and there is no way that I'm gonna begin this new chapter until I'm fixed. 
 Great. 
 You thinking median sternotomy or right thoracotomy? 
 I'm thinking I should finish my review of the imaging. 
 Sure. 
 No rush. 
 Actually, there is a bit of a rush. 
 But you know what I mean. 
 So, newbies. 
 What up? 
 Where y'all from? 
 Like hometowns, or... 
 Med schools. 
 Why would I care where you grew up? 
 Stanford. 
 - Uh, NYU. 
 - Harvard. 
 Preferred specialties? 
 Ortho. 
 All the way. 
 Neuro. 
 I'm planning a dual specialty in neonatal and pediatric oncology. 
 Impressive. 
 Also unlikely. 
 I know, it's a ton of work, but I'm pretty good at multi-tasking. 
 In med school, I did a combined MD/PhD... 
 - What's your mom do? 
 - My mom? 
 Don't stall. 
 Just answer. 
 She teaches high-school French. 
 Homemaker. 
 Surgeon. 
 Ouch. 
 Dad? 
 Also a surgeon. 
 Double ouch. 
 And yours? 
 Hasidic rabbi. 
 You've left the nest. 
 Actually, the... 
 the whole forest. 
 And yours obviously works on Wall Street. 
 But not a trader. 
 I'm guessing... 
 an M&A lawyer? 
 How'd you know? 
 She's read your resume, researched your social media. 
 She's probably run a credit check, too. 
 And you're under   , but wear Brooks Brothers button-downs. 
 - (MONITOR BEEPS) 
 - Are you done yet? 
 Left thoracotomy with a possible incision into the right atrium and inter-atrial septum as needed. 
 Left atrial approach through Sondergaard's groove makes more sense. 
 Not to me. 
 He's my patient. 
 But you're not a surgeon. 
 Which is why there is no reason for you to be grilling them, or picking the approach. 
 Stop worrying about protecting your turf. 
 Stop stepping all over it. 
 You're looking at tests I did for my patient. 
 How am I stepping all over your turf? 
 I think what Dr. 
 Browne is trying to say is, given there's no perfect approach, maybe it's best to defer to the surgical department's recommendation. 
 Did he just mansplain? 
 Not at all. 
 I... 
 I was just trying... 
 So you're just gonna do it again? 
 No, I'm just trying... 
 BOTH: Shut up. 
 We're gonna go in through a left thoracotomy. 
 Not my preference, but it'll work. 
 DR. 
 ANDREWS: What were you thinking? 
 You thought you'd impress me by undermining the patient's confidence in my judgment? 
 I'm sorry. 
 That wasn't my intent. 
 And you're supposed to be a mentor now, modeling professional behavior, not making it worse, Murphy. 
 She questioned your surgical plan. 
 I defended it. 
 How can we both be wrong? 
 I don't need you to defend me. 
 And I never wanna have a surgical debate in front of a patient. 
 We're not in front of the patient now. 
 The patient's breasts are small and a bit asymmetrical, but no woman's breasts are perfectly shaped. 
 You're wearing Prada shoes and a Dolce & Gabbana blouse, which cost more than most med students' rent, so, clearly, you understand your appearance has a tremendous impact on how people treat you. 
 There's a difference between nice clothes and a major surgery. 
 And I also understand the cosmetic surgery industry is dominated by male physicians with a sexist bias. 
 I've invited you to observe as a learning opportunity. 
 So I'd suggest less lecturing and more listening. 
 We'll access the tumor via an incision in the chest wall between your ribs. 
 It'll be an easier recovery than if we opened your sternum. 
 Are you sure you don't want us to call your family before we put you under? 
 Why? 
 So they can freak out and worry? 
 I'd rather just give them the good news when it's over. 
 It 
 is 
 going to be good news, right? 
 With a bit of cardiac rehab and a positive attitude, which I know you have, you'll be back sliding down the fire pole in no time. 
 Our firehouse has stairs. 
 Hmm. 
 Bummer. 
 LEA: It's a social media group where we all pretend to be ants. 
 SHAUN: Why? 
 Because ants don't care about politics, sports teams, or anything else people get so savage about. 
 Male ants develop from unfertilized eggs, which means they don't have a father and can't have sons. 
 But they do have grandfathers and can have grandsons. 
 Interesting. 
 And confusing. 
 Is it just me, or are those doctors watching us? 
 They're the new resident applicants. 
 They're here so Park, Claire, and I can evaluate them for Dr. Lim. 
 So, why are they standing over there? 
 Park had a video chat with Kellan, and I had a real lunch with you. 
 Shaun, you can't just have them stand there while you eat. 
 Part of being a good boss is being a good host. 
 You need to introduce them to people. 
 Like me. 
 Right now. 
 Come here, please. 
 Dr. Allen, Dr. Lundberg, Dr. Guerin, this is my girlfriend, Lea. 
 She runs the IT department now. 
 Okay. 
 Nice to meet you all. 
 Please join us. 
 Shaun's been telling me all about you. 
 Mmm. 
 N... 
 No. 
 I haven't. 
 So, I hope Shaun's not being too hard on you. 
 No, he's been great. 
 And the case we're observing is really interesting. 
 We're correcting a   -year-old girl's tuberous breasts with saline implants. 
 Dr. Allen told Dr. Andrews it was unethical. 
 He got mad. 
 I didn't say it was unethical. 
 I just... 
 I suppose I shouldn't have interfered. 
 Well, I don't know what a tuberous breast is, but I think implants are way overrated. 
 That's because your breasts are excellent. 
 Thank you. 
 That's exactly my point. 
 Mine aren't huge, but every guy who's ever seen them up close and personal has been thrilled. 
 I definitely was. 
 I am thrilled by every part of your body. 
 Sorry. 
 My bad. 
 Total TMI. 
 I'm not even bothered by your adenoidal voice. 
 Except when you talk to your mom on the phone. 
 But I just put on headphones. 
 At least you'll know he'll be a totally honest boss. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 DR.REZNICK ON SPEAKER: 
 The incision's extended superiorly 
 to meet the atriotomy, 
 and then the inter-atrial septum is opened up. 
 Retractor. 
 A Carpentier retractor is used to visualize the mitral valve. 
 That will allow a clear view of the tumor. 
 Can we turn the channel? 
 Color commentary's getting a bit annoying.

 (SIGHS) 
 How's Team Browne? 
 Any early standouts? 
 Jackson's a bit timid, but smart. 
 Wolke is definitely enthusiastic. 
 And your star recruit is... 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 Pretty full of himself. 
 I'm looking for surgeons, and according to his recs, he can dissect and suture like a pro. 
 I thought you were also looking for our input. 
 He's ranked first by every top program. 
 You really think they're all wrong and you're right? 
 So, what brings you all to the biz? 
 Had my ACL reconstructed in high school, both my rotators in college. 
 I love the idea of fixing people, helping them be the best they can be. 
 Surgeons are the ones with the God complex, right? 
 I have that. 
 I spent my life speaking Yiddish and studying the Talmud, and not shaving the sides of my hair, because someone up there supposedly cares. 
 Uh, but then I realized no one's up there. 
 No one cares. 
 No benevolent higher power is going to save us, so... 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 We have to save each other. 
 Can you top that? 
 - Definitely not. 
 - Try anyway. 
 You're obviously smart. 
 You've got two degrees from Harvard. 
 My parents are Harvard alums, so... 
 I'm sure that helped me get in. 
 You're not gonna get hired by undermining your own... 
 Something went wrong. 
 OLIVIA: Looks like they nicked a pulmonary artery. 
 No. 
 If they had, Browne would be suctioning instead of Lim reaching in with her hands. 
 ASHER: What are they doing now? 
 Nothing. 
 We can't access the tumor without compromising his entire cardiac outflow tract. 
 What about going in the way I suggested? 
 The median sternotomy. 
 The tumor's too far back. 
 We need to close him up. 
 Proton beam radiation would be too toxic to the heart. 
 DR. LIM: So is immunotherapy. 
 We can't access the entire tumor surgically, and we can't k*ll it without k*lling his heart along with it. 
 What if we cut out the parts we 
 can 
 access and try our luck with chemo on what's left? 
 IV doxorubicin and ifosfamide might slow the growth, give him a few more months. 
 No, I'm not sending my patient home with just a few extra months. 
 It's better than nothing. 
 What about a transplant? 
 Not an option. 
 Heart tumors are a contraindication. 
 What if we transplant his own heart? 
 If we take it totally out of his chest, we'd have access to the posterior heart. 
 We could excise the tumor, fix the defect it left behind, - and then put it back in. 
 - Cool. 
 CLAIRE: Mmm. 
 Not cool. 
 At least with a normal heart transplant, you'd be getting a healthy heart. 
 Her idea keeps the risk of removing the heart, and adds the risk that the heart we'd be putting back in has just been severely compromised having had a tumor cut out of it. 
 He's young, and the part of his heart 
 not 
 infiltrated with tumor is strong. 
 Do a cardiac MRA and see if the tumor's infiltrated the coronary arteries. 
 If it hasn't, Morgan's idea could work. 
 I'll schedule it. 
 DR. ANDREWS: Dr. Murphy is dividing the breast parenchyma into three pedicles. 
 Anyone know where this technique is derived from? 
 Breast reduction surgery. 
 That's right. 
 And why would I use a breast reduction technique to make the patient's breasts larger? 
 The technique frees up the tissue. 
 You can bring the pedicles together to make the breasts smaller or spread them out over an implant to make them larger. 
 DR. ANDREWS: Very good. 
 And now I'm going to turn the sound off. 
 Don't worry. 
 Nothing's wrong. 
 I just wanna talk about you behind your backs for a little bit. 
 So, first impressions. 
 Murphy? 
 I like Dr. John Lundberg. 
 DR. ANDREWS: I haven't even heard him speak yet. 
 He has the highest U.S.M.L.E. 
 scores. 
 And that's important to you? 
 (SOFTLY) 
 Yes. 
 It shows he has a broad knowledge of medicine. 
 What is important to you? 
 Well, I'm more interested in what they can do with their knowledge, which is why, so far, I'm most impressed with Jordan Allen. 
 No. 
 No, you said she undermined you. 
 Which takes courage and an assertiveness that will serve her well. 
 Then why did you tell her to stop lecturing you? 
 It's easier to teach an aggressive resident restraint than a passive one to assert themselves. 
 Oh. 
 What about you, Park? 
 What's important to you? 
 I wanna know who I can stand to be around for    hours a week. 
 One thing I learned as a cop, you don't really know a person until you've had a few drinks with them. 
 (MACHINE WHIRRING) 
 DR. REZNICK: LAD and circumflex look clean. 
 CLAIRE: What's with the right coronary? 
 It looks narrowed at the origin. 
 It's a bit narrow, but looks like a normal variant. 
 Yeah, but it seems hazy, like there could be some tumor infiltration. 
 What do you guys think? 
 - Us? 
 - Yeah. 
 Come take a look. 
 I guess... 
 - It's angiogenesis of the left... 
 - Stop. 
 Interrupting a female coworker is almost as annoying as mansplaining. 
 This isn't a rowing race. 
 You don't always have to speak first. 
 I... do not love the interruption. 
 But... 
 I like the enthusiasm. 
 What were you gonna say? 
 First, um, I'm not sexist. 
 Of course not. 
 He's shifting from right to left dominant circulation to feed blood to the tumor. 
 - Angiogenesis. 
 - I doubt it. 
 Surgery already showed his tumor extending to the right side, as well. 
 What were you gonna say? 
 The pulmonary artery is right behind that vessel. 
 It's causing radiographic scatter in this area. 
 The haze is just an artifact. 
 His arteries are clean. 
 I think she's right. 
 Hmm. 
 Your idea might just work. 
 DR. ANDREWS: If you invert the sutures and bury them under the skin, the scar will be invisible. 
 No one will ever know we were here. 
 Nice work, both of you. 
 - (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 - Her BP's dropping. 
 Push fluids, start IV pressors. 
 Check for bleeding. 
 - (RAPID BEEPING) 
 - She's in V-tach. 
 Move in the crash cart. 
 No bleeding. 
 No hematomas. 
 - SHAUN: Charging.

 SHAUN: Clear. 
 (DEFIBRILLATOR THUMPS) 
 (RAPID BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 (BEEPING SLOWS) 
 Sinus rhythm. 
 Her BP is stabilizing. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING REGULARLY) 
 Get her to the ICU. 
 I want post-op labs, CTA chest, and full   -hour cardiac telemetry. 
 We need to figure out what just happened. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 She's stable, but diffuse delta wave slowing. 
 Minimal brain activity. 
 An undiagnosed metabolic disorder could've caused an adverse reaction to the anesthesia. 
 Yeah, but her pre-op labs were all normal. 
 It's gotta be some sort of hidden heart condition. 
 You're big on opinions. 
 How are you with ideas? 
 What would you do next? 
 I'd check train of fours and reverse the paralytics with neostigmine. 
 If Dr. Murphy's right, she should wake up. 
 Smart. 
 But risky. 
 The meds will stress her heart. 
 If Park's right, she could arrest again. 
 I saw a similar case last year. 
 In Borneo. 
 You interned at a hospital in Borneo? 
 Uh, no. 
 I, uh, volunteered at an orangutan rescue foundation. 
 Our guide, a local villager, fell out of a tree. 
 He was, like, feet up. 
 How is falling out of a tree similar to a patient arresting during breast reconstruction surgery? 
 Well, he broke his back, uh, but when we got him to the hospital, I found he also had heart damage from rheumatic fever and metabolic abnormality from iodine deficiency. 
 It's rare here, but it's common there. 
 We only realized it when we ran a nuclear profusion scan of his entire body. 
 Good catch. 
 But a scan that extensive requires multiple radioactive tracers. 
 You think her heart could handle that? 
 Not tonight. 
 I'll get consent from the mom. 
 We'll do it first thing in the morning. 
 Once we confirm atrial closure, we'll put the heart back in. 
 Dr. Lim will reconnect the aorta and the superior venous connections, while I connect the inferior. 
 During my sub-internship, I assisted on multiple heart transplants. 
 Even sutured the atrial cuff in one. 
 I got to scrub in on a liver transplant once. 
 The... 
 The patient died. 
 What'd you learn? 
 That bile duct leaks are a lot harder to detect than bleeds. 
 Good. 
 Next time, I'd lead with that instead of the patient's death. 
 Are you all done yet? 
 Why? 
 Dr. 
 Park wants everyone to join him in the break room. 
 (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) 
 I'm Alex Park. 
 I'm a former amateur martial arts competitor who once thought it'd be fun to spar with a pro boxer visiting my dad's gym. 
 And that guy was, uh, Mike Tyson. 
 Who's Mike Tyson? 
 He's a guy from 
 The Hangover. 
 With the tiger and the tattoo on his face. 
 Nice. 
 You've just revealed you're crazy and old. 
 I've seen the musical 
 Wicked 
 over    times. 
 The San Francisco tryout, Broadway, Chicago. 
 I've even seen a friend's boyfriend's niece play Glinda at Stagedoor summer camp. 
 Nerd. 
 Next. 
 (CLEARS THROAT) 
 I'm Claire Browne. 
 Um, I love music, but I hate musicals, and, um, I don't... 
 I don't really like to talk about myself, so it's Shaun's turn. 
 My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I used to not like music, but my girlfriend, Lea, she changed my mind. 
 I also like to watch The Weather Channel on TV. 
 And... 
 (SHUDDERS) 
 I think pickles are disgusting. 
 (LAUGHTER) 
 Cops know how to manage up. 
 Managing down's another story. 
 Well, he's mature, thoughtful, doesn't have an ego. 
 Neither does Murphy, but do you think that qualifies him to supervise First Years? 
 Well, Murphy's smart, brutally honest, has no regard for social convention. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Mmm. 
 It works for Bill Belichick. 
 The Patriots are the most corrupt, dishonest organization in the history of the NFL. 
 Well, the Seahawks suck. 
 So, how's your experience been here? 
 It's been good. 
 Did you consider any other programs or was this your first choice? 
 This was my only choice. 
 Why do you hate God? 
 Oh. 
 Uh, actually, I don't believe there 
 is 
 a God. 
 I thought maybe it was because you believed he hated h*m*. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 I... 
 I don't think this is something that we should be discussing at work. 
 Why not? 
 Well, because it's personal. 
 Do you have a boyfriend? 
 I... 
 I'm sorry, but you can't ask that question in a workplace. 
 Dr. Park, he wants us to get to know you. 
 How can I do that without asking personal questions? 
 I have a girlfriend, and she is very important to me. 
 It affects my life in every way. 
 Probably should've thought of that before you told her how much her voice annoyed you. 
 I said it 
 didn't bother me. 
 It... 
 It was a compliment. 
 What I heard is you criticizing her voice, 
 and 
 you bringing her mother into it. 
 You're in trouble. 
 What about Browne? 
 She may have as much problem being a leader as Murphy, and without his gifts. 
 She has her own gifts. 
 Yeah, dealing with patients and their families. 
 But with her colleagues, she can be insecure. 
 Her assertiveness has always been a question mark for me. 
 They've all got areas that need improving, but I've gotten to know Browne a bit better these past few months. 
 She's stronger than she looks. 
 When's the last time you saw anyone digging a ditch in a suit and tie? 
 Surgeons don't dig ditches. 
 They help people at the most vulnerable time in their life. 
 And you shouldn't take the responsibility on if you're not fully committed to it. 
 You're entering a new phase in your career, position of authority. 
 Maybe my clothes are making you feel disrespected. 
 No. 
 The truth is, I just hate wearing anything that makes me feel like a suit. 
 DR. REZNICK: Great news. 
 I was able to get Sowinski on anesthesia for tomorrow. 
 Uh, why? 
 What happened to Foley? 
 Nothing, I just think Sowinski's better. 
 And we definitely need the A-team on this. 
 Yeah, I... 
 I agree. 
 Which is why I went out of my way to get Foley. 
 But Foley doesn't do well under pressure. 
 - Remember that time... 
 - Morgan. 
 You need to butt out. 
 You're not a surgeon. 
 This is not your job. 
 My job is to help my patient through the entire treatment process. 
 The best anesthesiologist for transplant surgery is Sowinski. 
 And I've already cleared it with Lim, so that's who it's gonna be. 
 Deal with it. 
 (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) 
 Are you mad at me? 
 I said your voice 
 doesn't 
 bother me. 
 It was a compliment. 
 Actually, what you said is that you love my breasts so much that with the help of noise-canceling headphones, you're willing to put up with my annoying voice. 
 Yes. 
 Not a compliment. 
 Oh. 
 So you 
 are 
 mad at me? 
 I'm not mad, Shaun. 
 I'm just busy, trying to keep, like, a billion bots and hackers out of our network. 
 (MOUSE CLICKING) 
 Actually, no. 
 I'm not doing that. 
 Gonna go home. 
 You want to have some tequila, stat? 
 We also have some pizza left. 
 No, I don't want tequila or pizza. 
 - (LAPTOP SLAMS SHUT) 
 - That must mean you're mad. 
 I'm just... upset. 
 And confused. 
 And I really don't think there is anything you can do about it, so you just need to stop trying and leave me alone. 
 SHAUN: She's not mad at me. 
 JORDAN: She's definitely mad at you. 
 She doesn't usually hide what she thinks. 
 ENRIQUE: She's not mad at him. 
 She knows how he is, how he talks. 
 She's mad at herself. 
 And scared. 
 We all have stuff that we're insecure about. 
 That's why it's so risky falling in love. 
 We all hope that when we let our guard down, it's for the one person that doesn't see our flaws. 
 So, what do I do? 
 You were being honest. 
 You can't apologize that away. 
 You gotta figure out what she needs to feel secure in the relationship again. 
 Don't look at me. 
 I'm single. 
 It's not my place to comment on your personal life. 
 You have an opinion. 
 Let's hear it. 
 Fine. 
 Can you zoom in on her skull base? 
 DR.PARK: I can, but why? 
 We're worried about her heart and metabolic abnormalities. 
 We shouldn't be. 
 Not anymore. 
 You and Dr.Murphy were both wrong. 
 She doesn't have a cardiac or metabolic issue. 
 She has poor blood flow in the artery supplying blood to the area of her brain that controls consciousness. 
 A small clot in her artery of Percheron. 
 If we don't remove it fast, she's never going to wake up. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 (SOFTLY) 
 That's amazing. 
 No, it's not. 
 The heart's totally outside of the body and still beating. 
 It's like it has a mind of its own. 
 She should've started the reimplantation by now. 
 Is everything okay, Dr. Lim? 
 DR. LIM: The tumor had tendrils invading the right atrial wall. 
 We took so much tissue to get a clear margin, there's not enough left to reconstruct his heart's inflow chambers. 
 How about expanded PTFE graft? 
 There's not enough atrial remnant to attach the graft. 
 You could use the septal wall. 
 He's got dense conduction fibers there. 
 - It could cause heart arrhythmias. 
 - Not if you use... 
 - (MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY) 
 - He's got low arterial pressure. 
 He's springing leaks at the cannulation sites. 
 It's a bleeding disorder caused by prolonged bypass. 
 You need to get his heart back in ASAP. 
 Morgan, we can't put the heart back in with two missing chambers. 
 DR. ANDREWS: (DISTORTED) 
 It's a rare complication, but a blood clot is a risk in any surgery. 
 DR. PARK: It's too deep in the brain for open surgery. 
 If we go rooting around in there, we'd definitely damage the PCA and k*ll her. 
 We could inject a dissolving agent into the clot. 
 There's a   % probability it won't fully dissolve, which could leave her with permanent weakness and cognitive difficulties. 
 JORDAN: Assuming she wakes up at all. 
 We need to remove the clot with a stent retriever. 
 If we rupture the posterior cerebral artery, she'll die on the table. 
 Or total recovery. 
 That's how she came into this hospital. 
 That's how she's leaving. 
 Prep her for stent retrieval. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 I'm hanging platelets and fresh frozen plasma. 
 His pressure is still in the toilet, but the bleeding is slowing down. 
 Not for long. 
 Small intestine submucosa has the right compliance to shape the chamber walls, but... 
 There isn't enough to cover that much area. 
 Use too little and he'll have heart failure in a month. 
 I know. 
 That's the ""but."" How thick is his deep fascia? 
 If it's over   millimeters... 
 DR. LIM: Morgan. 
 Get out. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'll... 
 I'll be quiet. 
 No, you won't. 
 You can't. 
 So leave the OR gallery. 
 Now. 
 We need  . 
 -millimeter-thick tissue with perfect compliance for arterial filling and contractile pressures. 
 If it was just the valve, we'd use a bovine pericardial graft. 
 But cow heart tissue is not durable enough to do an entire chamber. 
 But pig bladder tissue is just right. 
 I've used it for bladder reconstructive surgeries, but never hearts. 
 Let's rebuild the entire atrial walls with it. 
 Get down to the tissue procurement lab and get centimeters of porcine bladder tissue. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 Her EEG delta waves are slowing further. 
 DR.ANDREWS: She only has one vessel feeding her thalamus. 
 That's why the clot landed where it did. 
 I'm approaching the artery of Percheron. 
 I'm one millimeter from the clot. 
 Stop right there. 
 If we disrupt this clot, we could cause a shower of emboli into her brain. 
 Deploying the retriever. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 EEG just went flatline. 
 Calm down. 
 I'm almost... 
 Got it. 
 Blood's flowing through the artery. 
 Her brain tracing's looking better. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING REGULARLY) 
 This should fill the gap between the inferior and superior vena cava when the new chambers get sewn in. 
 Where's that graft? 
 I need more sponges. 
 The bleeding is getting worse. 
 - (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 - Oh, he's tanking. 
 Can you push epi? 
 I already did. 
 He's maxing out. 
 I'm running out of ways to keep his pressure up. 
 I got it. 
 They had centimeters of it. 
 Thank you. 
 If you want to gown up, you can watch from down here. 
 Definitely. 
 Thanks. 
 I thought telling her how much I love her in front of other people would make her feel good. 
 But Dr. Guerin said I made her feel insecure, and scared. 
 Women are sensitive. 
 When commenting on their flaws, total honesty is a high-risk procedure. 
 That sounds sexist. 
 Aren't men also insecure about their flaws? 
 Men are much, much worse. 
 And also, we're really stupid. 
 Okay. 
 What can I do now? 
 I've already said my stupid stuff. 
 I don't want her to be upset with me. 
 I have a thought. 
 I think this run of sutures will hold it to the annulus, but I'm worried about leaks. 
 We can put a second row of pledgeted sutures to make sure it's hemostatic. 
 That is unreal. 
 It's a work of art. 
 Now let's get it back in while we can still get him off bypass alive. 
 (FLATLINE) 
 CLAIRE: Re-perfusing the heart.

 - DR. LIM: We've got a rhythm. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING REGULARLY) 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 Hey. 
 There was a complication during the reconstruction surgery. 
 A clot, which caused you to lapse into a coma. 
 We performed a second surgery on your brain, which was successful. 
 Um... 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 But my breasts... 
 The clot occurred after we finished inserting the implants. 
 I think you're gonna be very pleased with the results. 
 Thank you. 
 Yep. 
 I... think I'm sorry. 
 Dr. Guerin said I should never say anything that might sound negative to a girlfriend. 
 And Dr. Glassman said total honesty is a high-risk procedure with a girlfriend. 
 It's better to show my love than try to explain it. 
 But I want to be totally honest with you. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 I don't like your body because it's excellent. 
 I like it because it's yours. 
 And I love hearing you talk. 
 When I hear your voice, especially when I've had a difficult day, I find it comforting. 
 Now I want to hug you. 
 Can I? 
 I'd like that. 
 I love you. 
 Thank you. 
 For your total honesty. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 DR. REZNICK: Your surgery went well. 
 With some time in rehab, you should be back to work in a month. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't thank me. 
 Thank your surgeon. 
 She did all the important stuff. 
 Lim's golden boy is in. 
 Nothing we can do about that. 
 So that leaves three openings. 
 The thought of working with Will Hooper for the next two years... 
 If Dr. Lim thinks he'll be a good resident, I'm sure she has good reasons. 
 She probably thinks arrogance is helpful to a surgeon. 
 Well, we could try to change her mind. 
 Eh, she asked us to evaluate the applicants, not her. 
 She asked us to be totally honest. 
 Eh, ""totally honest"" is a relative term when you're telling your boss she's totally wrong. 
 So, Hooper's in. 
 Who else? 
 Dr. Andrews likes Dr. Jordan Allen. 
 Oh, I do, too. 
 She's confident, driven. 
 She won't take a lot of hand-holding, and keeping Andrews happy keeps us happy. 
 That leaves two more. 
 Who's next? 
 Asher Wolke is very up-front about who he is. 
 - I like that. 
 - He's definitely eager. 
 And he couldn't be more open to learning. 
 Agree. 
 That leaves one more. 
 BOTH: John Lundberg. 
 Smart, professional, mature. 
 He's a no-brainer. 
 Lundberg's in. 
 Lundberg's out. 
 He stopped by my office before he left. 
 Said he's no longer interested. 
 He said you all were unprofessional. 
 Drinking at work. 
 Asking inappropriate questions. 
 Dating drama. 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 So, who's your alt? 
 Olivia Jackson or Boardshorts? 
 Olivia knows her stuff, but she's a bit insecure. 
 Her answers sound like questions. 
 I like Boardshorts. 
 He's sensitive. 
 Like a woman. 
 I vote for both of them. 
 That's not an option. 
 We don't have the budget. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Hooper is the worst. 
 The person I said was the best? 
 He is arrogant and obnoxious. 
 If he works here, we'll hate him, the work will suffer, and we'll either k*ll patients or we'll k*ll him. 
 And there is no way that you don't see that, which makes me think... 
 You do. 
 This was a test. 
 You just wanted to see if we'd be totally honest. 
 - Well done. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 Hooper is definitely the worst. 
 I only let him shadow as a favor to a board member. 
 I figured I'd give him a second chance after his obnoxious interview. 
 And also do a little experiment. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 So... 
 It's Jordan, Asher, Olivia, and Enrique. 
 To the next phase of your surgical training. 
 You helped pick them. 
 As senior residents, it's now your job to help train them. 
 And don't take this responsibility lightly, because if you don't train them well, people will die."

 So, how shall we proceed? 
 I'm going with ""drain the abscess and dress the wound.""

 Isn't that unfair to Jordan? 
 Was it unfair to the applicant who didn't get

 I got a great mechanic for you. 
 If you tell her Billy sent you, she'll give you a friends-and-family.

 Okay. 
 Thanks for that. 
 You have an amazing attitude. 
 You know, my wife used to tease me about that. 
 She died three years ago. 
 I'm sorry.

 We are through the uterine wall. 
 Dr. Jackson, what's our next step? 
 Advance through the trocar millimeters beyond the tip until the opening of the distal basket can be confirmed by ultrasound. 
 Exactly. 
 What would you like me to advance, Dr. Jackson? 
 Oh. 
 Yes. 
 Right. 
 OLIVIA: Obviously, you would be advancing the double basket rocket catheter, not this. 
 Sorry. 
 Not your fault. 
 If a junior resident is ill-prepared, that's on the senior resident. 
 How is it fair that I get blamed for a first-year's mistake, and how can I help that person without being unfair to the other one? 
 And how fair was the preferential treatment that you gave me? 
 And how fair was it to the other first-year resident, who didn't get placed because you helped me? 
 - And how fair was... 
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 Put the list down. 
 Only four questions at a time. 
 That's my limit. 
 What kind of mistake? 
 Even though I went over the procedure with Olivia, she still gave Dr. Andrews the pusher rod when he needed the rocket catheter, and he said it was 
 my 
 fault. 
 It 
 was 
 your fault. 
 You got to help her a little more. 
 That is not fair to Jordan. 
 What does fairness have to do with it? 
 It's not about equality. 
 It's about figuring out what each person needs and then teaching them how to get it. 
 How do I know what they need? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Well, you've taught them medicine, right? 
 So, uh, maybe it's something else. 
 Maybe it's an emotional issue. 
 Well, then I definitely can't give them what they need. 
 You can ask them. 
 About their emotions? 
 Yeah, ask them how they feel. 
 I don't care how they feel. 
 That's the beauty of it. 
 You don't have to care. 
 You just have to ask them how they really feel. 
 Then they start talking.

 I've always been very terrified of firsts.

 Yeah, I can still hear them laughing at me. 
 And two nights ago, I dreamt I was standing in front of Mrs. Deloitte's class again. 
 Couldn't wait to wake up. 
 But when I did, I realized that if I got the answer wrong today, no one will laugh, but someone may die. 
 The kids laughed at me, too. 
 Even though I knew   times   was   . 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 One of the amniotic sacs ruptured. 
 The strong twin's. 
 It's metastasized to his liver. 
 So, what do we do? 
 Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. 
 Short recovery time, but a significant chance his cancer returns. 
 Care to rebut? 
 I think we should consider a hepatic lobectomy and lymph node dissection. 
 Remove the affected area of the liver, all the surrounding tissue, and every swollen node we find. 
 And that's the aggressive approach. 
 Longer recovery time, high risk of complications, and, uh, admittedly, the best shot at beating the cancer. 
 By ""complications,"" you mean a barely functioning liver, a persistent threat of fatal bleeds, and chronic pain. 
 As surgeons, you can gut him, but as his primary doctor, I have to find the balance between longevity and quality of life. 
 CLAIRE: Last week, you were trying to perform surgery from the gallery, and now you hate surgeons. 
 Pick a side. 
 ASHER: A piecemeal approach is not going to work with Billy. 
 Every time we try to solve a problem, we discover another one. 
 You may have left your religion in Brooklyn, but you keep looking for meaning in random events. 
 The dice have no memory. 
 ASHER: I'm not looking for meaning. 
 I'm looking for patterns. 
 Maybe he's got some underlying condition. 
 I agree with Asher. 
 The dice have no memory, but they can be loaded. 
 So... safe and seriously compromised or aggressive and possibly dead? 
 Your case, Dr. Browne. 
 Your call. 
 How you feeling? 
 You sacrificed a lot. 
 Your hands, your career. 
 And you're taking it out on me and Claire and the whole surgical profession. 
 I get it. 
 It hurts. 
 You're pathetic. 
 You're worried about me because I'll never be a surgeon? 
 Boo-hoo. 
 You're worried about me because I took pleasure in screwing with you and Claire? 
 That's who I am. 
 The question is, who are 
 you? 
 You don't show up late with lame-ass excuses, and when you get dissed, you diss back, so... 
 How are 
 you 
 feeling? 
 Forget I asked. 
 He's lost most of his amniotic fluid. 
 Won't last very long in utero. 
 In helping the weak, we hurt the strong. 
 C-section? 
 If we do a C-section to save the strong baby, there's a   % chance the weak baby will die. 
 But if we do an amnioinfusion to save the weak baby, there's an   % chance that strong baby will die. 
 It's the better option. 
 % to decide which baby lives? 
 Kenzie's body has already made that choice. 
 If there's a strong baby and a weak baby, it's pretty clear which one we save. 
 Survival of the fittest. 
 Sorry. 
 It's just... 
 That's not really what we're about, is it, as a civilization? 
 Aren't the strong morally obligated to help the weak? 
 And if they don't, isn't everybody ultimately worse off? 
 Neither baby has to die. 
 Delayed interval delivery. 
 We induce labor, deliver the strong twin, then stop the labor to keep the weak twin in utero until his lungs mature. 
 The chances of stopping labor are very slim. 
 That's true. 
 There's about a   % chance that both babies would die. 
 Which makes it the worst possible choice. 
 - We need to ask Kenzie. 
 - No, we don't. 
 Once she hears there's the slightest chance of saving both babies, she won't listen to any alternatives. 
 Statistically, it's a terrible option. 
 But it 
 is an option. 
 No. 
 No, you can't seriously be asking me this. 
 I know that this is something no mother should ever have to decide. 
 There are no good options here, but there is one that'll most likely make you the mother of a healthy baby boy. 
 Okay.

 So, if it's inevitable... 
 Shaun, I am moving in with you. 
 Does that mean you think we have enough commitment and trust? 
 Honestly... 
 I'm not sure. 
 So, you want to do it just because it's inevitable?

 CLAIRE: Her seizure and coma were caused by a dermoid cyst. 
 It's a pocket of tissue with bits of teeth, hair, and fat. 
 She likely got it before she was born. 
 What can you do? 
 The less invasive option is to put in a drain to release some pressure, treat with anti-seizure meds and steroids, then basically watch to see if the swelling goes down. 
 And the more invasive? 
 Surgical removal. 
 But the cyst is deep inside and wrapped around major arteries, so it is more likely to fix the problem, but it carries risk of stroke or paralysis.

 Dr. Murphy, part of your job as a surgeon is to teach. 
 You can't opt out because it's difficult. 
 I am opting out because I'm bad at it. 
 Well, you can't opt out for any reason. 
 But I may have given you too much responsibility too soon, so I will supervise your supervision until you get the hang of it. 
 Pick someone. 
 Did you two lose something?

 Oh, no, I'm fine.

 You're not in Afghanistan. 
 You're in the hospital.

 Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's me. 
 Zoe, I... I couldn't sleep. 
 I... I went for a run, and I... 
 I heard an expl*si*n. 
 (BREATH TREMBLING)

 You were hit by a car. 
 We had to do surgery, but you're gonna be okay.

 Take him back to his room, make sure he didn't open his wound. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Dr. Murphy? 
 Rose is not your patient. 
 She was teaching me about her gift. 
 She says the basis of empathy is curiosity, which I find curious because... 
 I'm curious about the job you're supposed to be doing. 
 Who are you leading through the D&C? 
 None of them. 
 The only one who hasn't done one does not want to, so I will. 
 Which resident? 
 Wanting to is irrelevant. It's their job. 
 Wanting to is irrelevant. It's your job. 
 I'm a Christian. 
 Performing an abortion goes against my beliefs. 
 Okay. 
 You may encounter a situation one day where this procedure could save a woman's life. 
 Then I hope someone else can... 
 And it's my job to make sure you can perform all surgeries, including abortions. 
 So where does that leave us? 
 I'll do the surgery. 
 I've only done one. 
 I'm sure there's a lot I still can learn. 
 Dr. Murphy, you have a new student. 
 Get her started running pre-surgery assessments. 
 Thank you, Olivia. 
 That's the kind of ambition I like to see. 
 He did three tours. 
 He came home after he was injured in some kind of expl*si*n. 
 I don't really know what happened. 
 Some... He's tried to tell me about it several times, but he just... He breaks down. 
 When was he diagnosed with PTSD? 
 Two years ago. 
 But he hasn't been the same since he got back. 
 At first, he was moody, irritable. 
 Little things would set him off. 
 Then the insomnia started. 
 (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) 
 His mind is just... It's never at rest. 
 Nights are the worst, you know? 
 He, um... 
 He gets these terrible nightmares. 
 (RINGING STOPS)

 Oh, you can't give her this either. 
 You don't know what it is. 
 I know it would mean more if you had to leave the building to get it. 
 I would like to do the suction D&C surgery. 
 I assume your religious convictions haven't changed in the last few hours. 
 No. 
 But I believe I was put in this program for a reason. 
 So, if you think it's important for me to learn how to do an abortion, then I should learn. 
 Take Jordan to the skills lab. Run the surgery steps. 
 You two will handle the D&C yourselves. 
 With you. 
 How are you going to supervise my supervision if you're not there? 
 I will help you prep and debrief afterwards. 
 But this patient doesn't need a gallery of strangers standing around, gawking at her most private experience. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 Ben woke up complaining of pain.

 The pain is in his arm. 
 Now test external rotation of the shoulder.

 I was in a convoy in Kandahar, and there was a... 
 (BREATH TREMBLING) 
 (STAMMERS) I dislocated my... 
 You don't need to discuss it with us. 
 What did you find? 
 Swelling, sensitivity to touch, discoloration. 
 - Could be CRPS. 
 - What is that? 
 Well, it appears the car accident aggravated a prior injury. 
 You've developed complex regional pain syndrome. 
 We'll start you on Gabapentin and Dilaudid. 
 Opioids make me a little insane. 
 We could do a stellate ganglion block. 
 It's an injection of anesthetic near the spine that blocks the pain signals, and could also help the PTSD. 
 I've been treated for PTSD for years. 
 Why haven't I heard about this? 
 It's experimental, but promising. 
 The procedure comes with risks: 
 Vascular injury, infection, major hematoma. 
 Dr. Lim, I've been taking a risk every time I go to sleep. 
 I want to do it. 
 Stellate block is an accepted procedure for treatment of pain. 
 Which you wouldn't have suggested if the patient didn't also have a mental health condition. 
 (SHOES SQUEAK) 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) I hear Jordan's back on the D&C, in spite of her righteous indignation. 
 Is something chirping? 
 I think you're being unfair. 
 Well, if anyone's being unfair, it's me. 
 I told Jordan to do it. 
 I told her. 
 We make decisions that are hard to live with all the time. 
 We make them anyway. 
 And I told her pissing off the Chief was a very bad way to start your residency. 
 Glad to hear you're still moonlighting as surgical department camp counselor, but I don't mean you were being unfair to Jordan. 
 You're being unfair to the patient. 
 She's facing an emotionally fraught procedure. 
 She needs the support of her doctors. 
 And who she's getting is a rookie who thinks she's committing m*rder. 
 And Shaun. 
 I have a point. 
 I'll lead Jordan through the D&C myself.

 Rose claims she can feel her pregnancy. 
 She was right about the guy in Room    . 
 He had a clot in his ankle. 
 I'm sure she picked up on some subtle clues, like the guy moaning and grasping his ankle. 
 Get a CT to rule out abdominal injury from her fall. 
 DR. LIM: We're going to insert a thin needle into your neck so we can inject the anesthetic. 
 It may sting a bit. 
 Use an in-plane approach to place the needle between the C  tubercle and carotid artery.

 I know I shouldn't, but the shot just made his pain feel so much better.

 You didn't do anything wrong. 
 There was a noise in the hall.

 I'm sorry. 
 Nothing's broken. 
 I can get you something for the swelling. 
 No. I'm okay. I'm gonna go home, get cleaned up. 
 I just need some time. 
 I love you. 
 I think we can help Ben. 
 There have been some promising results using Vagal Nerve Stimulation to treat PTSD. 
 DR. LIM: His scarring would make it impossible to expose and find the nerve without damaging it. 
 Those scars are the reason that we need to try. 
 Imagine reliving your worst nightmare over and over again. 
 (SCOFFS) Why doesn't anyone around here want to do the job they were hired for? 
 What Ben needs is psychological help. 
 I've ordered a consult. 
 Leave it to the people who are trained to do it. 
 It sets a bad precedent to force a resident to do a procedure they're not comfortable with. 
 Wow. Does anyone around here not have an opinion about who should do that damn abortion? 
 Jordan had a choice, and in my opinion, she made the right one. 
 It's not a true choice if you're coerced by your boss. 
 I asked her to do her job. 
 You took an opportunity from a resident who wants to learn in favor of one who doesn't. 
 Is this song and dance about Jordan doing the procedure or your niece not doing it? 
 Neither. 
 There's a misconception that Olivia came to St. Bonaventure because of me. 
 She's here because of your reputation. 
 The great Dr. Lim, a master class in technique, professionalism, empathy. 
 Lately, it doesn't seem like that reputation holds up. 
 JORDAN: I'm giving you an antibiotic to prevent infection. 
 The vacuum aspiration will take about    minutes, and you'll be numbed with a local anesthetic. 
 Conscious sedation is also an option, but you will need someone to drive you home afterwards. 
 Do you have any questions for me? 
 I'm scared. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 Are you certain you wanna go ahead with the abortion? 
 Yes. 
 Then you don't have to be scared. 
 You're the making the right decision for you. 
 Give her another     micrograms of misoprostol. 
 I'll be back for the procedure. 
 This doesn't work. 
 I need these numbers in spreadsheet format. 
 - Thank you.

 Dr. Park? 
 Rose's CT was normal. 
 Get an upper GI barium study. 
 First quarter supply costs you requested. 
 Also, one of your first-years seems upset. 
 He's been in the stairwell for a while. 
 DR. LIM: Everything okay in here? 
 I just needed some quiet. 
 Surgeons come into the stairwell for two reasons, fire drills or doctor trauma. 
 You having a fire drill? 
 I just wish we had a more effective treatment for Ben. 
 His head's so messed up, and we can't help him. 
 I don't think this is about Ben. 
 Have you ever lost a patient you knew you could have saved? 
 When COVID was at its worst, we had to cancel all non-urgent procedures. 
 A young mom with a heart condition was more urgent than I thought. 
 And she died waiting for me to put her on the schedule. 
 How do you get past that? 
 You get past it because that's the job. 
 You will always remember it. 
 And you will eventually stop reliving it. 
 How can you be so sure? 
 Because if you don't, you can't be a surgeon. 
 And I'm pretty sure you're a surgeon. 
 I should get back to work. 
 Insert the speculum. 
 Now dilate the cervix. 
 Begin suction. 
 Begin gentle suction in the uterus. 
 Is anything wrong? 
 You're okay. 
 Dr. Allen, I can take it from here.

 Don't worry. We're almost done. 
 You're gonna be just fine. 
 You have no idea what that woman was going through, and you made it worse for her. 
 I know. I didn't... 
 You had an opportunity to opt out before you walked into that room, but you agreed to do the procedure, you took on an obligation to that patient, and you failed her. 
 If you ever do anything like that again, 
 I will have you removed from my program. 
 Maybe you should be cleaning bedpans for a while. 
 Hopefully there's no moral objection to that. 
 Why are there adult toys on my desk?

 Uh...

 Evidence suggests that trauma changes the way the brain works. 
 An over active amygdala can heighten someone's response to emotional stimuli, including fear.

 He could suffer a stroke or come out in a coma or not come out at all. 
 SHAUN: If you use a stereotactic laser approach rather than an open craniotomy, you would greatly reduce the risks. 
 This is not your case!

 Dr. Murphy, walk Asher through the probe placement and trajectory to the amygdala. 
 I will supervise your supervision. 
 Okay, insert the probe perpendicular to the cortical surface. 
 Stop! You're off course. 
 On the current trajectory, you will penetrate a branch of the choroidal artery and cause a hemorrhage. 
 Step away from the probe. 
 Your job is to teach, not take over.

 Adjust the probe one millimeter inferiorly. 
 Avoid the temporal horn on your right. 
 I can't see it on the image guidance.

 It should point toward your six o'clock on the Y axis. 
 You have to feel it.

 The tissue plane along the parenchyma is smooth. 
 It should feel like gliding. 
 You've reached the amygdala.

 Not afraid, disgusted.

 What changed your mind? 
 I've been thinking about change over time. 
 I spoke with people and also graphed several possibilities for us, using time as the horizontal axis and change as the vertical. 
 I realized that the problem isn't really change. 
 It's whether two people change in the same direction. 
 We want to keep our coordinates close to each other for the rest of our lives. 
 We certainly do. 
 But people sometimes do drift apart. 
 Yes. 
 You need a warning when you and your partner might be starting to veer off, so you can both change course a little.

gdoc_4_8,6470478,4,8,"Remember I told you my parents drop in unannounced? 
 - Mm. 
 - I just got a text. 
 They are coming here tomorrow. 
 Okay. 
 It's not ""okay,"" Shaun, it's an ambush. 
 My parents don't come to visit, they come to judge. 
 They hate everyone I date,   which means they're gonna ask you a ton of awkward questions. 
 It's going to be uncomfortable. 
 Very. 
 Okay. 
 You hate surprises. 
 Why aren't you more thrown by this? 
 Because it's not a surprise. 
 They're behaving exactly the way you said. 
 So a disaster is fine as long as it's a predictable disaster? 
 A disaster implies consequences. 
 We're adults. 
 Why would it matter what your parents think? 
 I don't know, because they're parents. 
 Doesn't it bother you that your grumpy second dad Glassman still doesn't like me? 
 - Dr. Glassman likes you. 
 - No, he doesn't. 
 - I have to go. 
 - Fine. 
 But I'm gonna text you some talking points. 
 Mostly subjects to avoid. 
 And it's gonna be a very long list. 
 How long has she had this wound? 
 Uh... 
 She fell off the vault two months ago. 
 Oh. 
 Slow healing and signs of oral bruising. 
 Are you on a restricted diet? 
 Coach put me on a performance diet. 
 High protein, high fiber. 
 I can show you her training log. 
 It's very standard stuff. 
 Although the noodles that she likes, they did a number on my stomach, too. 
 - What noodles? 
 - Konjac. 
 Girls on the squad eat them all the time. 
 Konjac noodles were banned in Australia several years ago. 
 They're dangerous, basically indigestible. 
 We will get another doctor to assess your symptoms and do a workup. 
 But we need to get Darya to Imaging right away. 
 I review my schedule, starting with the last appointment and working backwards. 
 It's an effective technique. 
 You might want to write this down. 
 Uncle Marcus, we had a deal. 
 No special attention. 
 That deal's off. 
 Livvy, you're struggling, and I can't sit on the sidelines anymore. 
 But special treatment from my uncle, it's only going to make things worse. 
 I owe it to you, and I owe it to this hospital. 
 I know you have unique talent. 
 So you've noticed both that I'm screwing up and that I have unique talent? 
 I noticed the talent long before you started here. 
 Aunt Tilly's annual barbecue. 
 You gave this to me when you were five years old. 
 And that moment, I knew you were special. 
 Hmm. 
 Giant mass of fiber blocking entry to her intestines. 
 Her blood tests also show low calcium and other nutritional deficiencies. 
 Can I see the  D reconstructed images? 
 It's unlikely to pass on its own. 
 We'll have to break it up and remove it endoscopically. 
 She also needs to quit gymnastics. 
 She has severe osteoporosis with compression fractures in almost all of the thoracic vertebrae. 
 - Huh. 
 - Interesting. 
 She is a   -year-old girl with the bone density of an   -year-old woman. 
 You have kyphoscoliosis, caused by insufficient diet and overtraining. 
 We need to surgically stabilize across the deformity to prevent the spine from failure and paralysis. 
 Spinal fusion... 
 That means that she can't compete, right? 
 Yes. 
 And the Games, they're less than a year away. 
 Could we wait until after to have the surgery? 
 If left untreated, there's a   % chance of progression, which could lead to respiratory failure, and death. 
 It's your call. 
 I take risks every day. 
 I'm not giving up my dream. 
 You're   . 
 It's not your call. 
 Her mother passed away when she was a baby. 
 And my father just told you it's my decision. 
 Coach is my dad. 
 Do what you need to do to clear the blockage, but leave her spine alone. 
 She wants to risk her life for a trophy, and her dad is okay with that. 
 I mean, that has to be some form of abuse. 
 This hospital is not gonna win a lawsuit against a caring father who supports his daughter's dreams. 
 All you can do is pull him aside and try to convince him to be responsible. 
 Yeah. 
 Convincing people to be responsible     has not been my strong suit lately. 
 We're not still talking about Coach Dad, are we? 
 You've been avoiding me. 
 I've been busy. 
 Recovering from a motorcycle accident that you lied about? 
 There's nothing to tell. 
 I hit a patch of wet pavement. 
 Well, Audrey... 
 You have PTSD. 
 I'm dealing with it. 
 I don't think you are. 
 Well, I also have a truckload of other things to deal with, including the annual surgical fundraiser Glassman just dumped in my lap. 
 Yeah, parties, they're important. 
 I'm dealing with it. 
 Mm. 
 How long have you had the severe heartburn? 
 Uh, six months, maybe a year. 
 BP is over   . 
 That's a little high. 
 Yeah, well, Darya and I travel a lot for competition. 
 I don't take care of myself. 
 Prioritizing your work over health is a bad idea. 
 For you and your daughter. 
 Thank you. 
 But may I kindly remind you, how long are the shifts that you doctors work? 
 High stress, no sleep. 
 When something is important, huh, you give it all you got. 
 True. 
 But we're adults. 
 Darya's not. 
 Yeah, but she's very different from other girls her age. 
 I mean, Darya, she works her butt off. 
 She's earned my r... 
 Respect. 
 You okay? 
 Oh, I'm feeling some kind of chest pain. 
 His oxygen sat and pressure's dropping. 
 Possible MI, lung problem, or aortic aneurysm. 
 Secure his airway. 
 Poor perfusion. 
 I think he's septic. 
 And vitals aren't improving. 
 Might be a spontaneous pneumothorax and trapped air in his chest. 
 No, his chest would sound like a kettle drum. 
 There's fluid in there. 
 Give me a blade, curved clamp, and a chest tube. 
 Boerhaave syndrome is easily misdiagnosed. 
 Nice catch with the percussion technique. 
 You may have saved this man's life. 
 Give me more retraction. 
 These tissue planes are terrible. 
 We're gonna have to debride the mediastinum. 
 There's too much damage to repair the esophagus without risking a chronic fistula. 
 The ongoing leakage into his chest means it would just be a matter of time before he dies from an infection. 
 The safest approach would be to permanently divert the esophagus. 
 And he'd have to eat through a tube for the rest of his life. 
 But I don't see a better option. 
 In    hours, with broad spectrum antibiotics and drains, the infection could clear and give us more options. 
 Which buys everyone time to come up with another brilliant win. 
 Does she really call her own father ""Coach""? 
 He is her coach. 
 What do you call your father? 
 - Abba. 
 - Pass. 
 Frank. 
 That's his name. 
 - Mm. 
 - Do you respect any traditions? 
 Not random ones. 
 Why should we create labels for things that already have names? 
 It's not just what Darya calls her dad, it's how they act with each other. 
 They're like coworkers. 
 That doesn't sound bad. 
 If I were meeting Lea's co-workers tomorrow, she would be much less anxious. 
 Family is supposed to make you anxious. 
 Introducing a new boyfriend to your parents, it's a big deal. 
 It's a rite of passage. 
 Polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia. 
 Torsade de Pointes. 
 We need magnesium sulfate two grams IV. 
 Heart rate's    . 
 She's not responding. 
 Move in the defibrillator. 
 - Charged to joules. 
 - Clear. 
 Did we do something wrong? 
 No. 
 Which is puzzling. 
 Mistakes by first-year residents are expected, but cardiac arrhythmia in a   -year-old is definitely unexpected. 
 I was gonna ask if you wanted a ride, but if you're working late... 
 Twenty hours to figure this out. 
 You sure you want to waste one of them driving home and back? 
 I think while I drive. 
 Not as well. 
 Not in the car. 
 Not at home. 
 Too comfortable, too many distractions. 
 Better to buckle down here, where, as a bonus, your colleagues can see you. 
 I was under the impression that results are more important than how a doctor is perceived. 
 And Jordan is running rings around you there, too. 
 Results don't matter if you can't make people listen. 
 Is that why you didn't want to perform the esophageal diversion? 
 You didn't hear me? 
 I made a decision for the good of the patient. 
 Now, it's up to you to prove me right. 
 She has a prolonged QT interval and sporadic extra beats. 
 Okay, I'm gonna get the newbies to recheck the renal panel and order endocrine and genetic studies. 
 I already did. 
 Also a tox and drug screen. 
 Are you okay? 
 Mm. 
 Lea's scared. 
 Mm. 
 Then I should prepare myself. 
 There is definitely something about me her parents won't like. 
 No, Shaun. 
 You are who you are. 
 Who you are is great. 
 You've been preparing for this your entire life. 
 When you do something important for the first time, like surgery, you practice. 
 I should practice meeting her parents. 
 Mm, how? 
 It's not like there's a simulator for learning how to navigate awkward social interactions. 
 There is. 
 But I need pizza. 
 Hmm. 
 Shaun, I'd like you to meet my parents, Pam and Mike. 
 Hi, Pam. 
 Hi, Mike. 
 Lea tells us you're a doctor. 
 What specialty? 
 I am a surgeon. 
 What a shame. 
 I hear surgeons are arrogant and overrated. 
 Okay. 
 Morgan, I'm sorry, but can you just give it a rest for half a second? 
 I'm in character. 
 Please address me as Pam. 
 I read recently that, while you're sleeping, you accidentally eat eight spiders every year. 
 Yes. 
 And I read that, sometimes, they lay eggs in your stomach, and then you can have thousands of spiders... 
 Shaun. 
 You said not to disagree with him when he says something wrong and pointless. 
 I didn't tell you to agree with him, because that only gives him more wrong and pointless things. 
 Good. 
 That's helpful. 
 Let's continue. 
 Did you know that Arizona doesn't have Daylight Savings Time? 
 Saving. 
 It's ""saving,"" not ""savings."" That's grammatic... 
 Wh... 
 How am I supposed to know what is pointless? 
 Facts are facts. 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 This isn't gonna work. 
 We could spend the rest of the evening teaching Shaun the fine but trivial art of how to finesse trivia. 
 But the real problem isn't gonna be small talk and family bickering. 
 The real problem is what happens when Lea's parents express real concerns about their daughter? 
 - What concerns? 
 - Concerns any parent would have. 
 You two barely know each other, you haven't been dating very long, now you're living together. 
 This relationship is moving too fast. 
 You're wrong. 
 I thought you said we shouldn't argue with your dad. 
 That wasn't my dad. 
 That was    % Glassy. 
 You can't prepare for how these evenings can go wrong. 
 Families are full of surprises. 
 Like how you don't like Lea. 
 I never actually said that. 
 Wow. 
 A first-year all-nighter. 
 Brings back memories. 
 Not of myself, of course, but of the losers who thought staying up all night drooling on their laptops made them look like better doctors. 
 So, cure cancer yet? 
 I'm trying to find a new way to repair a ruptured esophagus. 
 ""Fundic reinforcement with intercostal muscle flap."" Pretty cutting-edge stuff. 
 But why not go with diversion? 
 It's a lot safer. 
 Because ""safe"" is ordinary and boring. 
 Like me. 
 My uncle thinks I need a win. 
 And the only way to do that is to be impressive, like Jordan. 
 Makes sense. 
 You agree? 
 That Dr. 
 Allen is impressive? 
 Yeah. 
 And everybody knows that because Dr. Allen makes sure everybody knows that. 
 She and your uncle are cut from the same fashionably high-end cloth. 
 So, I don't just need to be a better doctor, I need to be a different person. 
 Wow. 
 You might want to start by being a person who feels a little less sorry for themselves. 
 Either you're an awkward, inconsistent loner who's irritatingly apologetic about your best qualities, or you're a quietly brilliant surgeon whom others ignore at their own peril. 
 If you're the first one, quit now and stop wasting resources. 
 But if you're the second, be that. 
 Maybe a little louder. 
 Where should we start? 
 Centerpieces, appetizers, color schemes? 
 Please tell me that you're at a hotel in the middle of the day because you're having an affair. 
 There were no surgeries scheduled, so I decided to volunteer to help. 
 - How helpful. 
 - Hmm. 
 We can get the job done in half the time and still have time to talk. 
 Or we can just talk. 
 I am not a   -year-old girl whose next backflip could k*ll her, Claire. 
 I don't need saving. 
 What do you think about twinkle lights? 
 Too prom? 
 Our tests show that your heart problems are being caused by excess estrogen levels. 
 And we want to know how it got in your system. 
 Medication? 
 A supplement? 
 Coach gave you my training logs. 
 You know as much as I do. 
 We also know that you're in a very competitive sport, so maybe there's something you're taking that's not on the training log. 
 If you are, we can't divulge that to anyone. 
 You think I'm doping? 
 No way. 
 - If your coach is pressuring you... 
 - He's not. 
 I'm sure it's a one-time thing. 
 Keep monitoring me. 
 I'll be fine. 
 Darya, you've made your dreams come true by being stubborn, being relentless, and just making things happen, but that's not how your heart works. 
 Or your spine. 
 She's not being stubborn. 
 It is going to go away, isn't it? 
 Because you are taking something. 
 And now you're going to stop. 
 Which means that it wasn't performance enhancing. 
 What is it for? 
 You took dr*gs for boobs? 
 The girl on YouTube said it would make them bigger. 
 Phytoestrogens used in herbal remedies can cause swelling in breast tissue, but there are potentially dangerous side effects. 
 What the hell were you thinking? 
 I didn't know it would make me sick. 
 I got tired of hearing the boys on the men's team talking about women with curves... 
 What if it showed up on a drug test? 
 What if you got banned from the Olympics? 
 It's natural. 
 It doesn't mess with performance. 
 - Other girls... 
 - I don't care about other girls, and I didn't think that you cared about other girls. 
 Are you... 
 I can't believe that you're willing to risk everything for something so childish. 
 It's not childish. 
 I give a lot to my sport. 
 I just wanted something for me. 
 You're not an adult. 
 Mm. 
 Fix her heart and her spine. 
 What? 
 You can't do that. 
 Are you punishing me? 
 I'm doing my job. 
 I'm your father, and we're a family, and it is my job to make good decisions when you won't. 
 Since when is being my father your job? 
 We never do anything but talk about gymnastics, not even Mom. 
 If you didn't think I needed my father after she died, why start now? 
 Darya... 
 I'm calling the team lawyer and filing for emancipation. 
 You think I can't make my own decisions? 
 Try this one. 
 You're fired, Coach. 
 We could try T-tubes. 
 Using them results in the formation of a controlled fistula and route for drainage. 
 Interesting. 
 But the patient would still have a long recovery and chance of reinfection. 
 What else? 
 I found some very interesting research on endoscopic vacuum therapy. 
 It's under investigation for the management of esophageal leaks. 
 Definitely innovative, Dr. Allen, but a little too much so. 
 This concept hasn't even gone through clinical trials yet, and we need to perform surgery today. 
 Dr. Jackson, you've been quiet. 
 I was thinking about fundic reinforcement. 
 My idea is to use the patient's own good tissue to reinforce the primary closure. 
 In this case, using the stomach as the patch. 
 Like the way we use a skin graft for third-degree burns. 
 Well, he'd be at risk of a diaphragmatic hernia. 
 Not if we cinch up the lower esophageal sphincter with a fundoplasty. 
 Mm. 
 Shaun, Lea tells us you're a doctor. 
 What's your specialty? 
 I am a surgeon. 
 But we are not all arrogant. 
 Though many of us are. 
 I'm still not sure if that's good or bad. 
 Is it hard? 
 For you? 
 I mean, it's a difficult job. 
 Shaun is excellent at his job. 
 So, how do you feel about vaccines? 
 Oh, my God. 
 Because, uh, they worry me. 
 They don't worry me. 
 - Oh. 
 - Really? 
 Because we've read a lot of stuff. 
 Especially since Lea told us about you. 
 Vaccines don't cause autism, Mom. 
 Want to talk about religion now? 
 I think that that was on the list - of things not to talk about. 
 - Mm. 
 Lea wrote you a list? 
 - Dad. 
 - Well... 
 Honestly, Lea, if we're so impossible to talk to, why even have us here? 
 Hemorrhoid surgery. 
 Excuse me? 
 Want more wine? 
 I removed a hemorrhoid from a patient with terminal cancer. 
 He only had a few months to live, and nothing would change that, but the surgery did make him more comfortable. 
 I suggest we treat this evening like hemorrhoid surgery. 
 Now, that's... 
 That's a good point. 
 You don't have to give him any more lists. 
 Let him talk. 
 I like this guy. 
 Okay.

 I went to see a psychiatrist. 
 I'm... 
 I'm so relieved to hear that. 
 Well, once. 
 The doctor said my symptoms warranted medication, so I haven't been back since. 
 Why? 
 If you need medication... 
 Why did you keep your PTSD a secret? 
 You chose to deal with your issues privately, on your own terms. 
 Why am I not entitled to the same choice? 
 Doing something self-destructive is not a choice, it's a mistake. 
 Just like it was when I did it. 
 So, when I do something you agree with, it's great. 
 When I do something you disagree with, - it's because I'm sick.

 I need silk ties and LigaSure. 
 His chest infection leaked through the diaphragm into the intraperitoneal space. 
 There's an abscess behind the stomach. 
 It's making the entire posterior stomach friable. 
 What if we use an intercostal muscle flap to patch the esophagus instead? 
 If we do that, it raises the risk of sepsis. 
 The patient signed off on risk. 
 - We should at least try. 
 - Not this level of risk. 
 We need to do the diversion. 
 Uh... 
 Your idea was good. 
 Don't give up on it so fast. 
 Reverting to diversion doesn't mean failure. 
 I searched ""eating meat near me,"" which was a mistake, but I did get a recommendation for a steak house your father might like. 
 You don't have to be nice to my parents anymore, Shaun. 
 We won't be seeing them again. 
 Why not? 
 ""We need to talk about Shaun.""     Mm. 
 They don't think I'm mature enough to be in a challenging relationship. 
 Leave it to my mom, she took us both out in one shot. 
 You do get that this is insulting. 
 To both of us. 
 From the people who supposedly love me most in the world. 
 They don't. 
 Not the most. 
 Not anymore. 
 Lea... 
 People who meet me are usually uncomfortable. 
 And most of the time, that doesn't go away. 
 How do you handle that? 
 I try to be patient. 
 Sometimes it works. 
 Maybe you're a more mature person than I am. 
 But I'm not sure if that is gonna work for me. 
 Have you seen Dr. Lim this morning? 
 Uh, no. 
 Why? 
 Darya's lawyer called. 
 - I need Dr. Lim. 
 - Dr. Lim's not here. 
 I don't know if she'll be in today. 
 If it's an emergency, maybe Dr. Glassman... 
 Dr. Glassman's in meetings this morning. 
 Who needs me? 
 Darya's lawyer is demanding that the hospital release her client. 
 Tell her lawyer we're not releasing our patient until she's healthy unless we receive a court order. 
 What's your problem? 
 Dr. 
 Andrews encountered complications. 
 He asked me to inform you that the surgical plan needs to change without the patient's consent. 
 That's Andrews' call. 
 I don't need details, just coffee. 
 I changed my mind. 
 I need the details. 
 Stay here. 
 Long, painful recovery with a feeding tube, or risk of death. 
 As his next of kin, it's your call. 
 I have to decide? 
 You made a life-or-death choice for yourself. 
 In fact, you insisted on it. 
 Well, that's different. 
 The doctors were asking me to give up something I really wanted. 
 The only difference is, your father is laying on an operating table waiting for you to grow up. 
 If something bad happened, I'd be responsible. 
 Yes. 
 That's the definition of adulthood. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 Of course you don't. 
 It's an impossible choice. 
 Terrible things happen either way. 
 And, yeah, it's on you. 
 I can't do it. 
 I just can't. 
 You're not a grown-up, Darya. 
 Luckily. 
 So those of us who are will make the impossible decision for you. 
 Dr. Andrews will do the diversion. 
 Someone will bring you to see your father when he's out of surgery. 
 What was that? 
 I saved that girl when you couldn't. 
 Yesterday, you told me to respect her decision. 
 Today, you tortured her into changing her mind. 
 Oh, did I make a little girl cry? 
 I can't do this. 
 I'm done trying to help you. 
 Oh, please. 
 You're never really done. 
 You know who you were last night? 
 My mom. 
 Drunk, angry, refusing to lift a finger to help yourself, lying about it, and taking your pain out on me. 
 It's gonna keep happening until you get help. 
 Take the medication, talk to someone, do something. 
 Please. 
 I'm not your mother, Claire. 
 I'm not your responsibility. 
 I'm your boss. 
 And I don't owe you anything. 
 Shaun? 
 What are you doing here? 
 You're wrong about me and Lea. 
 Oh. 
 Well, no offense, Shaun, but this is between family. 
 Lea is my girlfriend, and the texts you sent were about us. 
 We're sorry you saw those. 
 Shaun, you're a very nice young man, and we enjoyed meeting you. 
 It's just... 
 We've known Lea a lot longer than you have. 
 Yeah, she's, um... 
 Well, I mean, she has a good heart, she just doesn't think ahead. 
 And she will do anything to get under our skin. 
 You wouldn't believe some of the people she's dated. 
 I'm different than anyone she's ever dated. 
 How is that not a change? 
 That's true, Shaun. 
 I'm just not sure it's a good thing. 
 You knew her then. 
 You don't know her now. 
 All you know are her mistakes. 
 And you don't trust her because you aren't sure you were good parents. 
 You said our relationship has challenges. 
 You're right. 
 Lea and I go through challenges together. 
 It's one of the things that makes us stronger. 
 Lea challenges me to try things, even things I know I won't like, because it is not always better to stop and think. 
 And I make Lea patient, because I can be very frustrating. 
 So can the two of you. 
 Maybe this challenge will make your relationship stronger, too. 
 If you really think I should have the spinal surgery, I trust you. 
 I do. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Ever since your mother died, I've been scared. 
 What did I know about raising a little girl all by myself? 
 And you... 
 You were a handful. 
 Bouncing off the walls, backflips off the furniture. 
 You couldn't get me to the gym fast enough. 
 Because when you were on the beam, or flipping through the air, you're not just a little girl. 
 You are an amazing athlete. 
 As your coach, you make me feel amazing, too. 
 All this time, I thought I was giving you exactly what you needed. 
 But I was wrong. 
 What you needed was for me to be your dad. 
 And what your dad would have told you, that no matter how you look, or what you achieve, you will always be a beautiful, strong superstar to me. 
 - Thanks, Dad. 
 - Yeah. 
 Thank you. 
 I like you. 
 Okay? 
 Stop. 
 You're gonna make me cry. 
 You're a very cynical person, you know that? 
 Mm, actually, I'm not. 
 But you're a very grouchy person who cannot give a compliment. 
 You're funny. 
 You're smart. 
 And you make Shaun happy. 
 Which I guess is a good thing, but it also means you can make him very, very sad. 
 And that worries me, frankly. 
 I am not planning on hurting Shaun. 
 It's rarely intentional, you know? 
 My parents have an issue with Shaun. 
 And I just don't want Shaun's parent to have a problem with us, too. 
 Too bad. 
 Everything Shaun has gone through, all the rejection and the pain, the victories, they all belong to him. 
 But I feel every single high and every single low. 
 So, I'm sorry, I'm... 
 I'm not going to stop worrying about him,     even if he doesn't need me to. 
 Well, if Shaun saw that stain on your tie, it would drive him crazy. 
 Hey, Liv. 
 I'm sorry we didn't get to perform your surgery, but I'm really proud of the way you stepped up. 
 That surgery wasn't mine. 
 Of course it was, and it was brilliant... 
 And neither was the stone. 
 That story you told me about how you spotted my talent? 
 Um, I don't remember any of it. 
 I didn't paint that rock, and if I handed it to you, it didn't mean anything because I was five. 
 You have been carrying around a memory for over    years that represents your dream, not mine. 
 Clearly, that's not entirely true. 
 You went to medical school. 
 Because I do want to be a great doctor. 
 I wanted it so bad that I let you push me to think up some flashy surgery, even when my instincts already told me to do what I thought was the right thing, and was the right thing. 
 Livvy, I just want to help you be the best... 
 You want me to be Jordan. 
 If you're looking to mold someone in your image, she's perfect. 
 But, Uncle Marcus, I've got to be me. 
 And you can't help me do that. 
 Hey. 
 I'm still gonna brag on you like a proud uncle. 
 You know that, right? 
 Dr. Jackson. 
 - It's your parents. 
 - Yep, Shaun. 
 I saw. 
 They probably want something. 
 We should prepare. 
 Either they want to yell at us, in which case, we should not answer the door, or they could want to take us for dinner... 
 ...but we are already halfway through... 
 They want to take us to dinner. 
 Should I open the door? 
 What do you think? 
 I think... 
 ...they must have been good parents. 
 We should have dinner with them. 
 Do you want to text them back? 
 Last year, after my mom died, I was going through some problems emotionally. 
 I was diagnosed with PTSD. 
 I see. 
 Melendez knew. 
 Um... 
 Morgan found out because she's Morgan. 
 But I didn't tell anyone else. 
 I... 
 I didn't want anyone to know. 
 Why are you telling me this now? 
 Because Lim is going through something like it, but maybe worse. 
 She isn't going to therapy. 
 She has refused medication. 
 She... 
 Okay. 
 Um... 
 I don't think you should be telling me this. 
 Whatever Lim told you, she told you in confidence and as a friend. 
 Mm. 
 But she's not just a friend. 
 She's my boss. 
 You're her boss. 
 So I'm telling you because I have no place else to turn. 
 She won't let me help because she says it's not my job. 
 And she's right. 
 But it's your job to protect the hospital. 
 And her. 
 So..."
gdoc_4_9,6470478,4,9,"DR. REZNICK: Your primary care doctor was right. 
 The mass is on the smaller side. 
 We'll confirm with the new images,  but it should be manageable with medication. 
 No surgery needed. 
 Well, my fiance will be so relieved. 
 He's been worried I'll look like Frankenstein in all our photos. 
 Also that I might die. 
 When's the big day? 
 June. 
 You've been dealing with wedding planning on top of a pituitary tumor? 
 You deserve a medal. 
 Our medical record system, on the other hand,  it has you listed as female. 
 Probably because of the Pap smears. 
 Software clearly needs a trans update. 
 Deep breath. 
 (BREATHES DEEPLY) 
 I'll fix it so everything is correct going forward. 
 Please confirm your gender and pronouns. 
 Male, he/him/his. 
 Thanks for asking. 
 We're the ones with the messed-up software. 
 Your scans from this morning were just uploaded. 
 In less than two weeks, the tumor's doubled in size. 
 WOMAN: ** You're just too good to be true  ** I can't take my eyes off of you  ** You'd be like heaven to touch... 
 FEMALE PARAMEDIC: 34-year-old female, Zara Norton. 
 Tachycardic and delirious. 
 (CONTINUES SINGING) 
 Dr. Guerin, update vitals. 
 Dr. Wolke, draw blood for CBC and electrolytes. 
 ** Oh, pretty baby  ** Now that I've found you, stay **  Pupils are dilated, but reactive. 
 Ms. Norton, smells like you've had some marijuana? 
 Mmm-mmm. 
 I just unloaded a shipment at the dispensary. 
 Test for THC and a full tox screen. 
 I am a peddler. 
 ** Not a user **  Run it. 
 BP's elevated, 180 over 115. 
 That could explain the delirium. 
 Ooh, that sound high. 
 Better take my meds. 
 See, I never miss a... 
 Oh, no. 
 Oh, no, that's not it. 
 BP's climbing, 210 over 120. 
 Enalaprilat, 1.25 milligrams, IV. 
 Ms. Norton, do you remember the name of your medication? 
 You can call me Zara. 
 See? 
 It say right here on the... 
 (GROANS SOFTLY) 
 CLAIRE: Okay, forget about the meds. 
 She is not taking any. 
 This is untreated chronic hypertension. 
 What if you're wrong? 
 What if she's on a loop diuretic for her pressure? 
 This could cause renal failure. 
 (ALARMS BEEPING) 
 She's heading into hypertensive crisis. 
 What if we try an angiotensin receptor blocker? 
 No drug interaction. 
 Angiotensin receptor blockers work too slowly. 
 I'm giving her the ACE inhibitor. 
 (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 (BEEPING SLOWS) 
 BP's going down. 
 Nice call. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Latest budget report. 
 Yeah, the PDF's sitting in my inbox. 
 I'm trying to ignore it. 
 And thus... 
 A sit-down visit? 
 Just checking in, see how you're doing. 
 Okay. 
 You? 
 Me? 
 I'm... 
 recovering from the year,  like everybody else. 
 Pandemic, the surge. 
 You were here for every minute of every day. 
 It must have taken a toll. 
 It... 
 comes with the territory. 
 You're not, uh, stressed or distracted? 
 I'm... 
 tired. 
 Okay. 
 Well, maybe you should take some time off. 
 No. 
 But thank you. 
 I'm fine. 
 You don't seem fine. 
 Are there issues with my work performance? 
 No, you do great work. 
 Then I'm not sure why we're having this conversation. 
 Because I'm worried about you. 
 Because other people are worried about you. 
 There's no shame in struggling a little bit. 
 You know, what would be weird is  if you didn't struggle at all. 
 If you need to see someone, the hospital will cover the cost. 
 Great. 
 You'll pay my bills. 
 And the damage to my reputation, who takes care of that? 
 I don't think that seeing a therapist  will affect your career. 
 Says the white guy. 
 Okay. 
 Privacy protections are there for a reason. 
 No one needs to know. 
 Thank you for checking in. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 How you feeling? 
 Good. 
 Be better when I understand what landed me up in here. 
 You had an acute hypertensive crisis. 
 Oh, I know my blood pressure's high. 
 I'm already on medication for it. 
 You probably wanna know what it is. 
 There's no medication. 
 We need to do an echocardiogram  to make sure your heart wasn't damaged in the crisis. 
 Fine by me. 
 Here's 10% discount  on any purchase over $50 or more at Z & B Naturals. 
 I'm Z. 
 B is my partner Bill. 
 You're surrounded by pot all day, every day,  but you never touch the stuff? 
 How? 
 Why? 
 It's just never been my thing. 
 Ah. 
 The name always trips me up. 
 Chlorthalidone. 
 That's for hypertension. 
 Yeah, bottle seems pretty full. 
 How long have you been on this? 
 About six months. 
 Just refilled it. 
 Take it every day. 
 DR. REZNICK: Smile. 
 Head tilt. 
 Now he smiles. 
 Burst of laughter. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Yeah. 
 Rio Gutierrez, 29,  pituitary mass went from manageable with meds  to likely surgery. 
 So, talking to the new radiology resident, huh? 
 I wanted Dr. D'Souza's opinion on an intriguing set of scans. 
 She is very talented. 
 You're crushing on her. 
 N... 
 No. 
 I am not. 
 I love Lea. 
 Well, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. 
 Mr. Gutierrez's blood has high levels of prolactin. 
 Prolactin is produced in the pituitary gland. 
 The tumor could be secreting it. 
 Or the tumor could be reacting to the high levels of hormones  being produced elsewhere in the body. 
 The patient is a transgender man. 
 Do an ultrasound. 
 Advance the probe until you see the cardiac chamber. 
 ENRIQUE: Maybe Zara has secondary hypertension  due to renal vascular disease. 
 She doesn't. 
 Her creatinine is 1.2. 
 Her GFR is in normal range. 
 Well, that would make it unlikely, but not impossible. 
 It'd also explain why her prescribed hypertension meds weren't working  and why she got better when you gave her that ACE inhibitor. 
 Mmm. 
 Simpler explanation, she's not taking her meds. 
 Valve looks normal. 
 Should I move on to the two-chamber view? 
 Yeah. 
 We have no reason to think that she's lying. 
 She seems to be telling the truth about her pot usage. 
 No THC in her blood or urine. 
 She couldn't possibly be lying about something else. 
 The left ventricle is thickened,  which is consistent with untreated hypertension. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 Heart rate's climbing. 
 Cardiac output is dropping. 
 Stroke volume as well. 
 She's in cardiogenic shock. 
 (ALARMS BEEPING) 
 Would you mind if I did an ultrasound on your abdomen? 
 For a brain tumor? 
 This is my fiance, Eli Simpson. 
 When I heard about the new scans,  I kind of stormed the castle. 
 My hero. 
 Your prolactin levels are very high,  which might be caused by the tumor,  unless another condition raised your prolactin,  encouraging more growth. 
 What condition boosts prolactin? 
 Do you think I'm pregnant? 
 He can't be. 
 He's on testosterone. 
 Except for a few weeks last month. 
 I forgot to take my shot before our trip. 
 But there's no way that... 
 You're pregnant. 
 You went into cardiogenic shock  because your heart wasn't pumping adequately. 
 We did a minor procedure and installed an Impella pump,  but it's a short-term solution. 
 I do feel a little out of breath. 
 But that might be just 'cause of you, Dr. Andrews. 
 Ms. Norton, I'm a married man and your doctor. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 You have a rare condition. 
 Certain parts of your heart muscle  have become abnormally thick. 
 So, this wall in between the chambers, that's the septum. 
 That's a normal one. 
 This is what yours looks like. 
 Oh, wow. 
 It's gonna require surgery. 
 We're gonna run a few more tests to determine the best approach. 
 Wait. 
 You gonna be my surgeon, Dr. Andrews? 
 I sure will. 
 And y'all two gonna be with him? 
 Yeah. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 My lucky day. 
 Three doctors of color taking care of me. 
 Doctors who won't talk down to me. 
 Not exactly what I'm used to. 
 You guys know what I mean. 
 My mother made me wear a suit and tie  whenever we went to the pediatrician. 
 Put on your Sunday best just to get on the scale and touch your toes. 
 Yeah. 
 Made me so mad, I wound up becoming a doctor. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 The testing confirmed  your tumor is a hormone-producing prolactinoma. 
 And the pregnancy is about six weeks along. 
 Do you consider yourself gay? 
 I don't think that's... 
 ELI: Yes. 
 Because I am gay. 
 But you have vaginal intercourse with your fiance. 
 That is how he got pregnant... 
 Dr. Murphy, that's enough. 
 I... 
 I just want... 
 I think you should leave. 
 I'm sorry. 
 That was completely inappropriate. 
 Our treatment plan for your tumor  depends on your plan for your pregnancy. 
 So... 
 We've talked about kids,  but I always figured that was way down the road. 
 And not this way. 
 I always assumed we'd adopt. 
 I'd have go off T, and stay off. 
 If Rio doesn't continue the pregnancy,  then what happens? 
 Your hormone levels would drop quickly,  which would cause the tumor to shrink. 
 After that, we'd use medication, possibly a minor surgery. 
 I'd like to terminate the pregnancy. 
 ENRIQUE: I looked over all of Zara's labs. 
 All signs point to her taking her hypertension medicine regularly. 
 Her MRIs show significant ventricular septal thickness,  bad turbulence jet flow. 
 There's myocardial edema, too. 
 The ACE inhibitors were a bad call. 
 Which eventually sent our patient into cardiogenic shock. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKS, COMPUTER BEEPS) 
 Why'd you ignore what she was telling us? 
 (SCOFFS SOFTLY) 
 I made a medical diagnosis  based on pattern processing  that we're taught in med school,  which involves considering, you know, race, education,  occupation, BMI. 
 Always sounded like profiling to me. 
 (COMPUTER BEEPS) 
 MAN ON TV: Yes, we have the rain,  but more impressively, the wind. 
 That rain's going to be coming in sideways. 
 Just take a look at how the wind increases  as we progress throughout the day. 
 So, this afternoon, we're talking about  50-mile-per-hour gusts possible. 
 Sorry for crashing. 
 Radiology doesn't have a TV. 
 (TV CONTINUES PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) 
 You like The Weather Channel? 
 I find it soothing. 
 Would you like to join me? 
 And we have more intense rainfall coming through,  and that's going to also lead to some flood potential. 
 All of us are going to get into the action. 
 You got the mountains. 
 Would you mind if I lowered the volume by four output levels? 
 Oh. 
 That would be perfect. 
 All the areas around here in Northern California,  Modesto, Stockton, Sacramento. 
 (VOLUME DECREASES) 
 The northern part of San Francisco... 
 (TV CONTINUES PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) 
 I find the reflection on the screen so distracting. 
 So do I. 
 Could I  do this? 
 Nurse paged me. 
 Is something wrong? 
 I've changed my mind. 
 I want to keep the baby. 
 Since you're continuing the pregnancy,  we'll need to surgically remove the prolactinoma. 
 So, you'll cut into his brain? 
 Our safest option is to go in through the nasal cavity  in what's known as a transsphenoidal surgery, TSS for short. 
 It's less invasive than our other option. 
 That still sounds dangerous. 
 I've made up my mind. 
 Do I get any say in this? 
 I'm all for us having a family, but I'm not ready to... 
 No one's ever ready for kids. 
 Yesterday, you said that you never considered getting pregnant,  and now you're willing to risk your life for it. 
 When I was about seven,  I had this one refuge. 
 I'd hang a quilt over a couple chairs  and hide out with my two buds,  Foxie the Fox and Fuzz the Lion,  and I'd imagine,  I was the dad. 
 And they were my twin little guys,  fraternal, obviously. 
 We were a family. 
 When I transitioned, I put that dream aside. 
 At least, as far as them coming from me. 
 But now... 
 Whether we planned it or not,  this is our baby. 
 How soon can you do the surgery? 
 I'll order an image-guidance MRI to get things started. 
 CLAIRE: Based on the cardiac MRI and catheterization,  there are two treatment options. 
 Myectomy, basically open heart surgery,  and alcohol septal ablation,  where we use the alcohol to k*ll targeted sections of the heart muscle. 
 Well, what would you recommend? 
 The surgery is more invasive, tougher recovery,  but better efficacy long-term. 
 The ablation is less dangerous,  but you're more likely to need further medical interventions. 
 Now, you call that a recommendation? 
 There are pros and cons to both. 
 Uh, you'll need to weigh them. 
 I'll give you some time. 
 You always want to take care of people, Dr. 
 Browne? 
 Pretty much. 
 Me, too. 
 Oh. 
 Well, you run a marijuana dispensary. 
 It's not all about getting people high. 
 No, maybe not, but I'm guessing most of your clientele... 
 My Great-Aunt Lucy had pancreatic cancer. 
 A year, she hung on. 
 In agony. 
 Marijuana was the only thing that helped her eat or sleep. 
 Doctors didn't give her anything for the pain? 
 They suggested ibuprofen. 
 Now, you know doctors are 22% less likely  to give pain meds to Black patients  than to white patients with the same symptoms. 
 My point is, you and I, we're a lot alike. 
 We're both strong, Black women finding our way in the world,  but one of us knows more about medicine than the other. 
 So, I'd like to know, what would you do in my situation? 
 The open myectomy is a bigger risk  but offers more long-term benefits. 
 I've made my decision. 
 I'm with you, Dr. Browne. 
 Book the myectomy. 
 Here's the Rio Gutierrez imaging for your upcoming TSS. 
 Set that on the table, please. 
 I, um... 
 I noted the tumor's suprasellar expansion  and surrounding edema and splaying of circle of Willis. 
 That is very helpful. 
 Bye, Dr. 
 Murphy. 
 You're safe, Shaun. 
 She's gone. 
 Not really. 
 Dr. D'Souza is still in my brain. 
 I don't like it. 
 We kissed. 
 When? 
 What? 
 I have so many thoughts about her,  and I have so many questions I want to ask Rio. 
 Wouldn't he get more pleasure for... 
 Questions you're not supposed to ask him. 
 The kiss, Shaun. 
 When did you kiss? 
 Last night. 
 In my dream. 
 If I can't ask questions, how do I understand? 
 My... 
 My brain... 
 My... 
 My brain isn't behaving the way I want it to. 
 How do I make it stop? 
 You're attracted to Dr. 
 D'Souza. 
 Why does that bother you? 
 When I was with Carly and had feelings for Lea,  it meant I was supposed to be with Lea. 
 What if this means I'm supposed to be with Dr. D'Souza? 
 No. 
 You've loved Lea for years. 
 This is just... 
 attraction. 
 But shouldn't loving Lea make it go away? 
 Relationships would be a lot easier if it worked that way. 
 You're feeling guilty. 
 I say take Lea out for a nice dinner, something special. 
 And tell her about my crush. 
 I need to let Lea know. 
 No, definitely not. 
 No, you do not. 
 I want to get your thoughts on the suprasellar extension of the tumor  for this TSS. 
 You remember Sarah Pepper? 
 Runs nephrology at S.F. 
 Regional? 
 Always wears a shawl? 
 So, during the staff meeting last week, she fell apart. 
 Screaming, crying in front of the whole department. 
 Totally nuts. 
 Rough day at the office. 
 Wonder how you'd approach and resect without getting a CSF leak. 
 Yeah. 
 Place a lumbar drain, then infuse saline and do Valsalva maneuver. 
 Okay. 
 Apparently, Pepper's meltdown was so over the top,  the hospital forced her to take a leave. 
 How long? 
 Unspecified. 
 She's always been a little crazy. 
 Last I checked, eccentric and emotional didn't qualify as crazy. 
 Thanks for taking a look. 
 I read that cisgender people  often reduce transgender people to their genitalia,  and that that is offensive. 
 Did I do that to you and Rio? 
 Yes. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Rio will be going into surgery soon. 
 He's been asking for you. 
 You haven't been answering your phone. 
 Thanks for letting me know. 
 He is very confusing to me, too. 
 Rio has worked so hard,  he had a bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy  and takes hormone replacement therapy,  but now he is choosing the most female act. 
 It's not female if Rio's doing it. 
 Y... 
 Yes. 
 And he must have dealt with a lot of prejudice  during his transition. 
 I dealt with prejudice. 
 My brother helped me. 
 Does he have a brother? 
 His family doesn't talk to him. 
 And now Rio is having brain surgery. 
 He is very brave. 
 You can stay here. 
 I have a patient, Zara Norton. 
 We, uh... 
 We diagnosed her with HOCM. 
 I saw the file. 
 Dr. Guerin expressed some concerns  about my initial handling of the case in the ER. 
 He thinks I stereotyped her, based on her race. 
 Do you think you did? 
 She was crashing. 
 I had to make a call. 
 I didn't have a lot to go on. 
 Glassman came to see me this morning. 
 Someone told him I'm unstable and need help. 
 Any idea where he heard that? 
 I asked for help. 
 You can, too. 
 You're a resident. 
 No one cares if you need help. 
 I got this job in part  because my main competition, a man, backed me. 
 The second anyone thinks I can't handle this... 
 No one is gonna think that... 
 They will if you keep telling them I'm a mess. 
 You have PTSD. 
 You shouldn't be ashamed. 
 Says the women who just profiled a Black female patient. 
 You judged her,  just like people will judge me  and whisper that I've always been a little intense,  so no wonder I was asked to step down. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 Nobody needs to know. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Exactly. 
 You tell me that it doesn't matter. 
 You tell me everyone will understand,  and then you tell me to keep it to myself. 
 Should I be ashamed, or shouldn't I be? 
 All right, Ms. Norton, time to head to pre-op. 
 ZARA: What's in the bag, handsome? 
 I like to know what goes into my body. 
 Uh, cefazolin. 
 It's a prophylactic antibiotic we give before surgeries. 
 Makes sense. 
 Hey, what was the med y'all gave me when I first got here to the ER? 
 Enalaprilat. 
 It's an ACE inhibitor. 
 Isn't that for hypertension? 
 Mmm-hmm. 
 But I thought I already told y'all  I was on meds for my blood pressure. 
 You did. 
 So, you figured I needed more? 
 Or did you not believe me? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You must be scared. 
 You shouldn't have to be scared alone. 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 Eli. 
 I can't see you. 
 I'm right here, babe. 
 Can you follow this with your eyes? 
 It keeps disappearing. 
 You've lost peripheral vision. 
 The tumor is impinging on the optic fibers. 
 We can't perform the TSS surgery. 
 DR. LIM: With the tumor's continued growth,  the best remaining option is the open pterional craniotomy. 
 But it is higher risk with a lengthier recovery. 
 All of which is on top of the potential for gender dysphoria  during pregnancy. 
 Is that still a concern? 
 I think back to before I started taking T,  how terrible that felt. 
 The thought of feeling that all over again... 
 We could go back to the original plan. 
 You mean terminate the pregnancy? 
 The tumor should shrink on its own. 
 After everything you've done to get where you are in your life,  it's scary to think about doing something that would put that at risk. 
 (SIGHS) 
 This is my next step. 
 I'm ready to take it, even if I'm scared. 
 You have to take risks sometimes, Dr. Lim. 
 Thank you. 
 Shouldn't you be prepping Zara for surgery? 
 It's canceled. 
 She wants to be transferred to a different hospital. 
 One where she won't be ""racially profiled into heart failure.""  (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 Shaun, you okay? 
 SHAUN: I am having thoughts I don't want to have. 
 Both Park and Jordan say I shouldn't tell you. 
 But you're going to, aren't you? 
 Yes, I am. 
 I have a work crush. 
 Also, my patient is a pregnant trans man... 
 Okay, one at a time, Shaun. 
 About this... 
 crush? 
 Her name is Dr. Cintia D'Souza. 
 She is a second-year radiology resident. 
 Last night, I dreamed we were in the Residents' Lounge,  watching The Weather Channel, and then we started kissing... 
 Okay, I got it. 
 Are you mad? 
 Park and Jordan were right. 
 I shouldn't have told you. 
 No. 
 I'm not mad. 
 A little surprised, but that's okay. 
 I'm still attracted  to other guys sometimes. 
 N... 
 No. 
 No. 
 What? 
 Who? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 Who? 
 There... 
 Okay, there is this one physical therapist... 
 N... 
 No. 
 No. 
 No. 
 What if we're attracted to other people  because there is something wrong with our relationship? 
 You're not planning on kissing Dr. D'Souza in real life? 
 No. 
 Or working late with her,  doing some X-rays alone,  where you might end up leaning over the same light box. 
 We don't use light boxes anymore. 
 And I don't plan to work late with her. 
 Then I don't think either of us has anything to be worried about. 
 (INHALES SHARPLY) 
 I have to go prep for a pterional craniotomy. 
 I'm Dr. Glassman, president of the hospital. 
 Unless you're here to drive me to S.F. Regional,  you can head right back on out. 
 I apologize for your experience in the emergency room. 
 That's mighty white of you. 
 (SIGHS SOFTLY) 
 I don't recommend that you transfer to S.F. Regional,  or any other hospital, for that matter. 
 I'm sure they got the same fancy equipment,  same shiny sets of diplomas y'all got here,  and maybe a few less r*cist doctors. 
 Well, apparently, that doesn't seem to be the case. 
 I pulled data on comparable hospitals within 100 miles,  did numbers on surgical outcomes  and patient satisfaction, aggregated by race. 
 Apparently, we're doing well, comparatively. 
 Your argument is that your hospital may be racially biased,  but it's less racially biased than these other hospitals? 
 Yeah. 
 Pretty much. 
 Stay at St. Bonaventure,  the president of the hospital will monitor your care every step of the way. 
 For whatever it's worth,  I don't think you can do better than that. 
 She's gonna stay, on one condition. 
 That you're off the team.

 He used to pick me up every day after school. 
 And then, one day, he just… stopped showing up. 
 And for years after, I would come home, 
 I’d make sure the curtains were open, and I’d wait. 
 If a car slowed down in front of the house, I’d imagine it was him coming to grab me up and rescue me, and I thought if I wanted it enough, he’d come back. 
 So I just… I just had to want it more, you know? 
 And finally, I gave up. I stopped looking out the window. 
 I grieved and buried my father a long time ago, and I’m just… I’m not interested in getting to know him just to grieve him all over again. 
 But he’s still your father, and you’re still you. 
 Some day you’ll hate yourself if you turn your back on him.

 There is a 10% to 15% chance, approximately. 
 Femur replacement is a very complicated procedure, made even riskier by your underlying condition. 
 The safest route is to amputate. 
 Very little chance of major complication during surgery, and there have been great advancements in prosthetics.

 DR. REZNICK: You should come over tonight. 
 Unless you need to rest up for your Franken-penis surgery. 
 You embarrassed me in front of a superior. 
 Did you get fired? 
 Did you get pulled off the surgery? 
 I was just getting you back for giving me that rancid coffee. 
 It was coffee. 
 Plain coffee with one cream and one sugar, the exact coffee I’ve seen you have every day for the last three years. 
 I was being nice. 
 Same reason I put an umbrella over your gigantic head. 
 I was being a decent human being. 
 When did we start doing that? 
 How was I supposed to know you didn’t dose my coffee? 
 Because I’m not an emotionally stunted person. You are. 
 Anything that resembles intimacy freaks you out, and you start throwing blows… Low ones. 
 And if hooking up causes you to cross boundaries like that, it’s better to go back to the way things were. 
 Barely friends, no benefits. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 You’re in love with him. 
 Aren’t you? 
 Is that why you’re having the surgery? 
 You’re afraid that if you lose dance, you lose him? 
 You are risking your life to save something that… 
 Isn’t real. 
 Leo and I share a life together. 
 We’re partners in every sense of the word… 
 Except one. 
 My best friend growing up was a girl named Rachel. 
 She and I lived in a very religious community, so it was kind of assumed we’d get married. 
 Which was fine with me, because Rachel was… 
 Beautiful… 
 And smart and funny. 
 And I loved her. 
 But then I fell in love with the boy down the street. 
 He never knew. Nothing ever happened between us. 
 But it’s like all of a sudden, the world… 
 Lit up. 
 And I realized Rachel and I wasn’t enough. 
 I had been lying to myself and to her. 
 She deserved to be loved and wanted in a way that… 
 Lit up someone’s world. 
 And she spent years loving someone who could never give her that. 
 You need to tell Leo how you feel. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 We share our secrets, our pain. 
 He listens to me when I’ve had a bad day. 
 He holds me when I’m scared. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 I don’t want anything to change between us.

 (MUSIC STOPS) 
 I feel… 
 Disconnected from you and the baby, which… 
 Yes, you are very connected to already, but I don’t feel anything. 
 Because it is not a baby yet. 
 It is a fetus, and… it is making my girlfriend sick and mad at me. 
 And I feel very… 
 Alone. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 (SIGHS) 
 You are being so… 
 Selfish. 
 I’m growing your baby, Shaun, and reading books and making appointments and taking vitamins the size of my face and working a full-time job. 
 And on top of that, you just dropped on me that you don’t feel anything for our baby and expect me to make you feel love and connected and… 
 (SIGHS) 
 Mm. No. You know… 
 (DOOR SLAMS) 
 (KNOCK ON DOOR) 
 Dr. Lim suggested I come talk to you. 
 I know you deserve better than me. 
 You deserved a father, and I failed you, and I can’t make up for that. 
 Breeze and I were high school sweethearts. 
 We thought we were gonna take over the world together. 
 We were young and naïve and stupid. 
 And we got pregnant before graduation. 
 I had a scholarship to Howard, but it didn’t cover family housing. 
 So I gave it up, because I wanted to be there. 
 And yet, you left the family you gave it up for. 
 You should have taken the scholarship. 
 We got married, and we gave it a go for a while. 
 But I could not handle Breeze’s mental illness. 
 When we broke up, she made it hard to see you. 
 Don’t blame her for what you didn’t do. 
 I am not blaming her. 
 I was immature. 
 At least she was there. 
 At least she stuck around… 
 Drunk and sick and out of her mind. 
 I… I waited for you, and I loved you, and you left. 
 Claire, I’ve always loved you. 
 Nothing could change that. 
 I thought about you every single day. 
 You know, I don’t care. 
 Thinking about me wasn’t enough. 
 It didn’t do anything for me at all. 
 You… You could have fought for me. 
 You could have come back before now. 
 I ran away. 
 I was a coward. 
 And I stayed away because I was running from my own guilt. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Whether I’m in your life or not, you should get the surgery. 
 Because if you don’t… 
 Then you’re still a coward. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 (BIRDS CHIRPING) 
 I feel scared, too. 
 What are you scared of? 
 Everything. 
 And I don’t want to go through this alone. 
 I don’t want to go through nine months knowing you view this baby as a medical condition you don’t feel anything for. 
 I’ll resent you. 
 And that scares me more than anything. 
 And I want to help you feel connected. 
 Oh, no, sorry. We’re not having sex right now. 
 I realize that was misleading. 
 I want you to put your head on my belly and talk to Berry. 
 About what? 
 Anything. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Hello… 
 Berry. 
 My patient is a 26-year-old ballroom dancer with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. 
 She presented with a retroperitoneal bleed but now needs a total femur replacement. 
 It is a very risky surgery. 
 I am your father, and I am a surgeon. 
 Did that make you feel better to talk to him? 
 No. 
 A fetus can’t hear any sounds until 18 weeks, and we don’t know if it’s a him yet 
 because it doesn’t have fully formed genitals. 
 I will see you at your appointment later. 
 I don’t think you should come. 
 There’s a chance it’s too early to hear a heartbeat, which will make me feel sad and scared. 
 And if I can hear it, I will feel happy. 
 And either way, you will probably feel nothing. 
 And… that’ll make me feel more alone than I already do, so… you should just not come. 
 Okay. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 (MONITOR BEEPING)

 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 Isn’t it possible Leo loves Maya as much as she loves him? 
 Does it matter that he doesn’t want to have sex with her? 
 Sex isn’t just about sex. 
 It’s about intimacy and desire and a deep mutual physical connection. 
 And she thinks she has that. 
 That’s the last of the proximal femur. 
 Let’s get the distal end out. 
 SHAUN: Maybe Maya and Leo have such a strong relationship because it’s based entirely on an emotional connection. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 ENRIQUE: She’s hypotensive. 
 SHAUN: There are secretions around her breathing tube, and her oxygen levels are dropping. 
 She’s rejecting the platelets. 
 DR. ANDREWS: Stop the transfusion. 
 Increase her oxygen and respiratory support. 
 Start dopamine and epinephrine. 
 (RAPID BEEPING) 
 BP’s 87 over 52. She’s stabilizing. 
 But without the transfusions, her risk of bleeding out goes way up. 
 Are we going to move forward or amputate? 
 (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) 
 Her partner’s her proxy, right? 
 He’s got a decision to make. 
 My God. 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 She trusted me to protect her wishes. 
 And she wants to dance. 
 Y-You should try to save her leg. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Maya’s in love with you. 
 That’s why she’s having the surgery. 
 She thinks if she loses dance, your relationship will end. 
 And only you know if she’s right. 
 If she is… 
 If losing her leg means losing the two things she loves most, then maybe you should honor her wishes. 
 But if she’s wrong… 
 If you do love her and will stay with her no matter what, then you should do whatever it takes to save her life. 
 Of course I love her. 
 There’s no question that I love her. 
 (SIGHS) So, the only question is… 
 How much? 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 Miles is stable. 
 But we found significant polyp burden not detected on his CT, and we sent to biopsies. 
 His cancer was caused by familial adenomatous polyposis. 
 That’s genetic. 
 50% chance of carrying the gene if you have an affected parent. 
 You need to get a genetic test. 
 Even if you have the gene, with regular colonoscopies, we’ll be able to catch it… 
 Thank you. 
 (DOOR CLOSES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 What’s this? 
 Male, late 20s. 
 Needs bilateral carpal tunnel release surgery that he got playing in the United States Chess Federation. 
 You like to play chess with Kellan. 
 Your game sucks. Figured you might learn something. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 This is you being a decent human. 
 Maybe sometimes it’s not terrible. 
 This is delightful. 
 I can give it to someone else. 
 Thanks. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Are you glad you went to see your father before he died? 
 No. 
 My father hurt me. 
 He was a bad man who did bad things. 
 I already knew that. 
 My father hurt me, too… By leaving me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 He didn’t even try to be a good dad. 
 How can you be sure he didn’t? 
 Maybe he did try and he couldn’t. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Well, if something is important to you, you make it happen. 
 But what if you can’t? 
 What if you’re trying to connect with your child and it just doesn’t work? 
 It is difficult to feel something for someone you don’t know yet. 
 Do you want to know what kind of man your father is? 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Why… Why would you do this to me? 
 (VOICE BREAKING) I told you I was willing to take the risk. 
 I wasn’t. 
 I love you. I couldn’t risk your life. 
 I’m so sorry. 
 But I’m here. (SNIFFLES) 
 I’m not going anywhere. 
 You’re not gonna lose me. 
 We’re gonna get through this, My. 
 We’ll be okay. 
 (SOBS) 
 I sleep all the time and I’m still tired. 
 When was your last bowel movement? 
 I don’t know. A couple days. 
 Shaun, what are you doing here? 
 SHAUN: Smile. Uh, what? 
 There is something in your teeth. 
 Shaun. 
 Do you eat a lot of black licorice? 
 Uh, yes. You should stop. 
 Eating too much black licorice can lower potassium, which causes fatigue and constipation. 
 Stop eating it. 
 That’s it? 
 Yes. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 Lea doesn’t want me at her OB-GYN appointment. 
 There’s a woman in the waiting room with a very interesting mole. 
 The year Maddie was born, I took on twice as many surgeries. 
 I… (LAUGHS) I hid at the hospital. 
 I was afraid that I was gonna piss off my wife. 
 Sound familiar? 
 Upset my daughter. 
 I thought you liked being a dad. 
 I did. I… I just didn’t think I was very good at it. I… 
 It didn’t come naturally to me. Not like… 
 Not like brain surgery. 
 I missed a lot. 
 Sometimes I think if I had been there for the swaddling and for the changing of the diapers and… 
 See her first steps, you know? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Shaun, do yourself a favor and be there for as many moments as you can.

 Chess guy’s super cool. 
 He’s gonna teach me Petrov’s Defense while he heals. 
 I didn’t mean to take things so far in front of Andrews. 
 I guess I had a tiny overreaction. 
 It’s okay for us to be nice to each other… Sometimes. 
 Headed home? 
 I wouldn’t mind some company, if you’re up for it. 
 See? 
 Nice is good. 
 Sometimes. 
 I’ll see you at your place.

 Where’s Leo? 
 I don’t know. 
 I asked him if this could be enough. 
 If I could be… 
 He loves me. 
 I knew that. 
 But not enough. 
 I suppose I knew that too. 
 (SNIFFLES) 
 As long as he was here, I would never make room for anyone else. 
 So I asked him to go. 
 [♪♪♪♪] 
 I’m sorry. 
 It’s okay. 
 I’m sure there are a ton of great guys who’d want to be with a one-legged, unemployed former dancer with chronic nosebleeds.

 I’ve been mad at you for so long.

 That I couldn’t feel any other emotion. 
 Just anger. 
 Angry at you. 
 Angry at myself for secretly wishing you would turn up on my doorstep my entire life. 
 (SIGHS) I thought I’d outgrown it. 
 But when you went into surgery today… I didn’t feel anger. 
 I felt…

 Since the last time we went three rounds. 
 But if you want to stop… 
 I didn’t say that. 
 I recall you saying quite the opposite. 
 I want you not to depend on this being here for you, thinking you can plug in any time you want. 
 I’m aware that I need the charger’s consent. 
 You need to see other women. 
 Why? I don’t really want to… 
 No excuses. 
 If we’re gonna keep hooking up, you should start sleeping with other people. 
 You’re a very strange woman. 
 Have you seen my phone? 
 Oh. And remember, we have to leave the hospital by six tonight for birthing class. 
 The birthing class that I don’t need on account of my O.B. rotation in medical school. 
 But where I will learn how to give you the support you need while giving birth to our child. 
 That is my guy. 
 I got the results of the fetal DNA test. 
 Okay. 
 This will tell us the sex of the baby. 
 I know. On account of my O.B. rotation in medical school. 
 Aren’t you excited? 
 Not by that. 
 There are only two outcomes that can be detected on this test, and I am fine with either. 
 So am I. 
 I’m excited to find this out.

 This is a pretty large hematoma. 
 We need to drain it.

 Drain it? Like with a needle? 
 We can numb you if you like. 
 Get that away from me.

 My physical therapist says I should be walking four hours after surgery and good to go in ten to 12 weeks, but… I’m aiming for nine. 
 Can you please tell my mom that that’s not a good idea? (CHUCKLES) 
 You should not rush your recovery. 
 Does it matter to you whether you are having a boy or a girl? 
 I’m having a boy. 
 We’re gonna name him Ray, after my dad. 
 My girlfriend and I are going to have a daughter. 
 That’s great news, Shaun.

 No more pills or cortisone sh*ts or…

 You are soft and prone to attachment. 
 I promise you I will not get attached.

 What’s gonna keep me from getting attached to you isn’t the charms of other women. 
 It’s your utter lack of any.

 I don’t know how Jean pushed through the pain. 
 A female fighter pilot in the “Top g*n” era? 
 She’s pushed through worse. 
 SHAUN: Things are much better for women today. 
 In this surgery, I am the only man. 
 But until they find a way to put uteruses in men, biology will always force us to make sacrifices our male colleagues don’t. 
 Is that why you don’t have children? 
 Shaun, that is not something you should ever ask a woman. 
 Well, I brought it up. 
 I never consciously made that decision. 
 But along the way, I made a bunch of small ones that put my job in front of having a family, and… I don’t regret it. 
 But it does piss me off that most men don’t have to choose.

 Be careful not to breach the pleural space. 
 Define your terms. 
 Does “date” mean “have dinner with” or “meet up for sex”? 
 I’m not entirely sure. 
 Mm, by the time there’s food involved, I prefer to be exclusive. 
 In the hematoma now. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 Mm, I’m not able to aspirate anything. 
 That’s not just clotted blood. 
 It’s a mass. 
 It’s about five centimeters across, firm, non-mobile. 
 It’s very dense. 
 Get a biopsy, but that looks like breast cancer. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 Oh! If there might be a problem with her heart, should she be putting strain on it? 
 If I’m gonna have a heart attack, this is the best place for it. 
 That is exactly right. 
 (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 It’s very likely your mom is fine, that the blood pressure drop was just a reaction to the anesthesia. 
 You’re a very successful pilot. 
 Was that harder because you are a woman? 
 For me, standing out was a plus. 
 It got me noticed. 
 Mm, that’s not always a good thing. 
 It’s the Navy. (LAUGHS)

 But pressure’s just an opportunity to get better. 
 Your mother is very inspiring. 
 Yes… she is. 
 I can go harder if you need me to. 
 Yes, please. 
 I don’t have breasts. 
 How can I have breast cancer? 
 You have breast tissue, and while it’s rare in men, it does happen. 
 The biopsy has identified a particularly aggressive tumor. 
 But the good news is we caught it early.

 We don’t believe there’ll be any long-term loss of strength or… 
 Can I keep my implants?

 It’s possible. 
 But highly unlikely. 
 At the end of this, the Body gotta look like the Body. 
 Otherwise, I’ll lose my sponsors, my career.

 While you are under the soothing touch of your partner, let’s discuss birthing plans. 
 Okay, maybe just a little less pressure.

 Uh, not really. 
 Remember, you are in charge of your birthing experience. 
 Every aspect of your labor is your decision, starting with when you head to the hospital. 
 Okay, maybe just stop. It’s okay. 
 It’s okay. 
 I recommend what Doulas call the 4-1-I rule. 
 You wait until contractions are four minutes apart and last for one minute for at least… 
 Five minute intervals is safer. 
 That’s one opinion, Dr. Murphy, for mothers who enjoy waiting at the hospital. 
 Once you arrive, clearly instruct your partner and your doctor of what you want. 
 No. The doctor needs to be in charge. 
 What if there is a complication? 
 Mm. 
 Maybe just let her talk. 
 (QUIETLY) Sorry. 
 After your water breaks, fortify yourself for the work ahead. 
 Be that with meditation or a pre-selected song that you find soothing or perhaps a light snack. 
 That is a very bad idea. 
 Dr. Murphy, please hold your comments until the… 
 You shouldn’t eat after your water breaks. 
 Many women experience bowel incontinence during labor.

 We might poop ourselves. Okay. 
 No one mentioned involuntary pooping.

 How was the class? Very informative. 
 When’s the next one? There won’t be a next one. 
 We were thrown out. 
 None of our tests showed any issues with your heart. 
 You are in great shape. 
 Then what caused the blood pressure drop? 
 Mm, Dr. Browne must have been right. 
 It was a reaction to the anesthesia. 
 So, when can I get out of here? 
 When we know you can get around safely on your new hip. 
 Oh.

 I will be helping her. But thank you. 
 Let me know what you decide. 
 Of course. Thank you. 
 Shaun, I am so excited about our baby. 
 And I am so scared about delivering her. 
 It’s gonna hurt. It could go on for hours. 
 Possibly over a day. 
 And I need to know that I can have whatever I need, a massage at exactly the right pressure… 
 Mm… a hand to squeeze really hard, a cool, wet washcloth. 
 Oh. 
 Or a warm, wet washcloth. 
 Oh. 
 Can you do that? 
 I can get better at massages. 
 I’m sure you can, but those aren’t really your strengths, are they? 
 It’s… just a set-up for failure, and I know neither of us wants that. 
 No. We don’t. 
 Yeah. 
 HEATHER: Dr. Park. 
 Dr. Boyd. 
 I definitely do not know this because it’s completely confidential, but hypothetically, if you were treating MMA rockstar Bradley Vargas, and if I had a ten-year-old patient who would go bananas for a signed photo… 
 I’ll see what I can do. 
 Thanks in advance for the autograph. 
 It’ll make a ten-year-old’s day. 
 No. What? 
 She’s all wrong. 
 She’s a Pedes resident. 
 They’re all kind and nurturing and they care about things, and she obviously wants you to keep all your chargers at her house. 
 That’s not what you need. You need fun. 
 Text the redhead. 
 What redhead? 
 Candace309. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKING) 
 Change your password to something I can’t guess. 
 (KEYBOARD CLACKING) 
 No tumors in the frontal or parietal lobes. 
 Next we should check for a glial-based tumor in the brain stem. 
 Squeeze my hand as hard as you can. 
 Lea said she may need to do that during labor. 
 I want to be prepared. 
 Okay. Okay, that’s enough. 
 We need a better look in the high cervical cord. 
 Is Lea feeling nervous about labor? 
 She thinks she needs a Doula to support her, but she doesn’t. 
 You squeezed my hand very hard. 
 I can take it. 
 Mm, I think there’s probably gonna be more to it than that, Shaun. 
 I’ve also looked into antimicrobial options for washcloths, to wipe her forehead. 
 What else? 
 I don’t know. 
 Neither do you, or Lea, or the doctor, or the Doula… 
 That’s what’s terrifying about it. 
 It’s the biggest day of your life, and the only thing you know for sure is that another human is gonna force its way out of you. 
 High cervical cord is clear. 
 Breathe. 
 (EXHALES SLOWLY) 
 (BREATHING SHAKILY) 
 Good. You’re almost there. 
 The lighting in this room is very harsh. 
 We didn’t call for a surgical consult, Dr. Murphy. 
 I know. I’m here for research. 
 Well, this is a bad time. 
 Next contraction, I need you to push. 
 Okay. 
 I am very interested in anything you can share about your experience. 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) What are you feeling right now? 
 Like… oh, like he’s trying to… Oh, rip out everything! 
 Do you wish you had gotten an epidural? 
 Yes! 
 It’s too late now. 
 (GROANS) 
 Please page Dr. Glassman. 
 (BREATHING SHAKILY) 
 Lea wants to have a Doula. 
 Okay, and, uh, you don’t? 
 Research shows that Doula-assisted births have fewer complications, decreased length of labor, and increased breastfeeding rates. 
 So, you do want a Doula? 
 N-No. 
 I can precisely measure the time between contractions and get the right washcloths and I’ve mapped out the fastest route from the OB floor to the cafeteria for ice chips. 
 I don’t want Lea to have a Doula. 
 But… they are good. 
 I am very bad at massages. 
 So, you… you want Lea to have everything that she wants, but you don’t want her to want a Doula? 
 Yes. 
 How do I do that? 
 I don’t know. 
 I just… (CHUCKLES) 
 It can’t be done. 
 It’s like you… you want a red shirt really badly, but it has to be green. 
 Why can’t you just give her what she needs? 
 Hm. 
 Okay. 
 Good. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) ANDREWS: We need to expose the underlying pec major. 
 Dr. Park, gently cut with microdissection needle. 
 Mm. I really need to join a gym. 
 I mean, I know I’m never gonna look like “The Body,” but I could try to look like I have a body. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 Raise the flap and be careful not to thin it too much. 
 Bradley’s transformation is impressive, but it’s not real. 
 Strength, determination, hard work… those things are real, and worth striving for. 
 Not to the exclusion of all else. 
 The day I lost my job as Chief, I went home and drank myself to sleep every night for a week. 
 Better to drown my sorrows than to let my wife see me cry. 
 When your marriage fell apart, did you tell a good friend that you were heartbroken, or did you just hit something really hard for a long time? 
 Both are fine, but men don’t do both. 
 I’m guessing no one told you you were a “real man” when you came out, but that took a lot more courage than getting pummeled inside of an octagon. 
 I can’t see any clear tumor margins. 
 The tumor extends beyond what was visible on imaging. 
 It was obscured by the pec implant. 
 Close him up. 
 We need to wake him and get his consent for a total mastectomy. 
 I can’t go home yet. 
 I still don’t know what’s wrong with my patient. 
 Then why did you ask me to wait? 
 This is for you. 
 Oh. Okay. 
 This will massage your shoulders whenever you want at exactly the right pressure. 
 There are three settings and a pulsing option, which I think would be irritating, but it is up to you. 
 When I wear this, you can squeeze as hard as you want. 
 Also, I have been building up my washcloth tolerance. 
 I am up to 15 seconds. 
 That’s great, Shaun. 
 But I decided I want Theresa there for the birth. 
 It’ll make me feel safer and more comfortable. 
 I… can make you feel safe and comfortable. 
 I am the father. I am going to be a good father. 
 I know that, and I believe that. 
 You don’t need her. 
 Maybe not, but I want her there. 
 It’s my body and my birth experience, and I want to have a Doula there with me, so we’re gonna have one. 
 I love you. 
 I’ll see you at home. 
 WOMAN ON TELEVISION: …less than two weeks away, so don’t get too comfortable. 
 The brain and spinal MRI scans were clear. 
 You don’t have a tumor. 
 (SIGHS) One less thing to worry about. 
 What’s left? 
 There is still a very long list. 
 I need to perform a carotid sinus massage to test for hypersensitivity. 
 I have been working on my massage technique, but you may pass out. 
 That’s how we know if the test worked. 
 Elongate your neck and turn your head ten degrees away from me. 
 Did you have a Doula when you gave birth? 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 No one I know had a Doula back then. 
 Or fancy birthing suites or hypno-breathing or the luxury of three months off to recover. 
 It’s not a luxury, Mom. 
 It’s important for the mom and the baby. 
 If women wanna compete, then compete. 
 (CHUCKLES) We can’t ask for special treatment and then complain that the playing field isn’t level. 
 I got a long weekend, and then back in the plane. 
 I didn’t have a choice. 
 You had a choice. 
 Stop breathing, please. 
 You always loved to fly. 
 Maybe more than being stuck on the ground with me and Dad. 
 No. 
 Okay. (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 I didn’t like leaving either one of you. 
 I just wanted you to see me be strong so you knew you could be strong, too. 
 I did. 
 Being scared and weak, I wasn’t always sure if that was okay. 
 (ALARM BEEPING) Oh, my God. 
 Wait, is this what was supposed to happen? 
 No. This is not supposed to happen. 
 (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) You need a total mastectomy, including the removal of your pec implant. 
 But with training, your strength should fully… 
 I can’t get back in the octagon with half my chest caved in. 
 I’ll lose my sponsors. Then find new ones. 
 Once people know what you’ve been through… 
 You honestly think I’m gonna let anyone know I had breast cancer? 
 What about non-surgical options? 
 What about chemo? 
 Chemo alone isn’t the best way to treat this. 
 It doesn’t have to be the best. It just has to work. 
 There’s no guarantee it will, and given the tumor’s invasiveness, they’ll have to use toxic… 
 I can take whatever you throw at me. 
 But I’m not having surgery. 
 EEG results are normal. 
 You’ve never had a seizure before, but it’s possible one was missed. 
 There are many different types. 
 Does Jean ever stare off, become non-responsive? 
 No. 
 No. 
 But there was that one “bathroom episode”? 
 When I came to stay with you, after Dad died. 
 Oh, that was nothing. 
 It was late and she fell asleep watching TV. 
 She got up to use the bathroom and got light-headed and then almost fainted. 
 I think I was just exhausted. 
 Did it happen again? 
 Uh, hardly ever. 
 A couple times, over the last few years. 
 There is no mention of this in your medical record. 
 I told my internist. 
 He said it happens to some women during menopause. 
 Have you experienced other symptoms that were attributed to menopause? 
 Of course. 
 Tell me what they are and when they started. 
 Um, I think I had some constipation and sleep issues. 
 When? How long? 
 I-I-I don’t know. 
 I don’t remember. 
 I-I told my doctor, and he told me not to worry about it. 
 He told me to forget about it, so I did. 
 (TELEPHONE RINGING) 
 Mrs. Williams. 
 I have an urgent problem I have to talk to you about. 
 You’ll need to wait your turn, Mr., uh… 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I need answers about Jean Starzak. 
 She was your patient. Now she is my patient. 
 Dr. Murphy, if you can wait, we can talk in private. 
 Okay. Yes. 
 You failed to chart many of Jean’s symptoms, constipation, sleep disturbances, hot flashes, reduced libido. 
 She’s not sure she remembers all of her symptoms or when they began, so we cannot figure out what is wrong with her. 
 Sounds to me like she’s in menopause. 
 You’re a talented diagnostician, Mrs. Williams. 
 No. She’s not. 
 Menopause doesn’t explain her recent blood pressure issues. 
 Mrs. Starzak’s chart, please. 
 It’s not in there. 
 And she mentioned several episodes of nighttime dizziness, which I believe were seizures. 
 What is in here is enough to remind me that the dizziness was menopause. 
 Micturition syncope, not seizures. 
 And the blood pressure issue isn’t new. 
 But also isn’t a symptom of anything besides her anxiety about forced retirement. 
 It wasn’t… 
 I know it happened during surgery. 
 She wasn’t anxious. She was unconscious. 
 My daughter is never coming to see you. 
 According to this piece in “Clinical Endocrinology”, Jean’s symptoms match pretty well with Addison’s disease. 
 She doesn’t have hyperpigmentation, or weight loss. 
 Not all cases presented with 
 …Cortisol levels are normal. 
 There have been several recent case studies correlating hypothyroidism with low post-op BP. 
 Jean’s TSH is borderline high. 
 But her thyroid hormone is in the normal range. 
 What about sleep apnea? 
 I read about a case involving BP crashes. 
 That’s interesting. 
 Mm, Jean’s body type isn’t typical with apnea, but we could ask about snoring. 
 I would like to see that case literature. 
 It’s not a conventional case write-up. 
 I saw a post on Reddit. 
 Mm. 
 What subgroup? 
 The women’s health community. 
 Mm. It’s not scientific. 
 At all. It’s not helpful. 
 But neither is this. 
 There is nothing here. 
 The medical establishment isn’t looking into this stuff. 
 It’s ignored women like Jean, as demonstrated by her own doctor not charting her symptoms. 
 That is true, but is still a bad idea to rely on anecdotal evidence. 
 I agree with you. 
 If you have a better idea, I am happy to go with it. 
 Keep checking Reddit. 
 Claire, can you look at social media postings? 
 I’ll check out the blogs. 
 You changed your profile picture. 
 It sucks. It looks like me. 
 It’s not like I photoshopped your head on someone else’s body. 
 If I’m gonna sell myself, I at least want to sell who I actually am. 
 The women who answer your posts don’t care who you actually are. 
 And based on this photo, I don’t think you know who you are. 
 You’re reading Proust? 
 BRADLEY: (VOMITING) 
 Once the ondansetron kicks in, you should start feeling better. 
 Just in time for your next chemo session. 
 (CLEARS THROAT, SNIFFLES) 
 I’ll get through it. 
 I know you will. 
 Doesn’t mean you should. 
 It’s dumb. 
 You’re acting like an idiot because you’re less afraid of months of pain and nausea than being exposed. 
 You’ve constructed a perfect facade, and you’re gonna k*ll yourself trying to preserve it. 
 But being strong has nothing to do with being “The Body.” 
 Tell that to my fans. 
 My sponsors. 
 I think you should. 
 Tell them none of this makes you a man. 
 You were just as brave and strong back when you were a fat, bullied little kid that decided to make a change. 
 That kid didn’t let other people tell him who he could be or what he was capable of. 
 Don’t let him down now. 
 Schedule the surgery. 
 This woman says she had chronic low blood pressure and her doctors blamed it on her “weight loss obsession”. 
 Turned out she had congestive heart failure. 
 This woman’s seizures were attributed to her pregnancy. 
 She was on her fourth doctor 
 before they correctly diagnosed her epilepsy. 
 CLAIRE: I got something. 
 This woman spent years with the same symptoms as Jean, before she was diagnosed. 
 Parkinson’s Disease. 
 You’re healing well. Pathology results show clean margins. 
 You should regain full strength and be back in the octagon in a few months. 
 Thank you. 
 There’s something I wanna show you. 
 “My Next Fight is Breast Cancer.” 
 Over a million views, with some very encouraging comments. 
 A few you will want to mute. 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 And a bunch of women who are really into scars. 
 The test confirms you have Parkinson’s Disease. 
 CLAIRE: We believe it’s been progressing for a few years. 
 Your hip pain may well have been the first indicator. 
 Can I still fly? 
 I’m afraid not. 
 How do we treat it? 
 Unfortunately, the delay in diagnosis has allowed the symptoms to intensify, and there is nothing we can do to reverse that. 
 You should still have several more years of decent mobility, and we can help manage the symptoms with medication. 
 We’ll let you two have some time alone. 
 I’d like to go home. 
 Can you, uh… 
 Can you see about getting me discharged? 
 Tory, please go. 
 No, Mom. 
 It’s okay. 
 (SOBBING) 
 How’s your phone battery? 
 ‘Cause there’s a charger at my place. 
 It’s time to retire that metaphor. 
 I’m busy. 
 You were right. 
 I’m attachment-prone, and there’s nothing wrong with that. 
 As long as I’m with someone who feels the same way. 
 HEATHER: I found the place.

 But I can’t. 
 Not by myself. 
 It’s okay that I am bad at massages. 
 She will handle them. 
 Thank you. 
 How do you two feel about frankincense oil? 
 Um… 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 No thanks. (CHUCKLES) 
 Lea, 
 the world is harder for women. 
 I want to change that, but I don’t know how.

 By letting her know that she’s loved and supported. 
 We’ll raise her to be strong.

 The fact it was children who were shot is devastating news. 
 And so we have yet another day in an otherwise peaceful community erupting in v*olence, the kind of atrocity that has sadly become all too commonplace.

 ASHER: Once. 
 And then what?

 Uh, we fixed two holes in your son’s ventricles. 
 We’ve removed his spleen and repaired his liver, but he’s still in surgery. 
 Your son has lost a lot of blood. 
 We’re giving him transfusions, but the blood loss may have caused damage to his brain. 
 If his brain is fine, then we should push on, but if his brain isn’t fine, then… continuing the surgery could k*ll him. 
 Unfortunately, we can’t accurately assess for brain function in the O.R., so we would have to wake him up and do a traditional neuro exam. 
 You need her to decide that? 
 Why put that on her? 
 You guys are the doct… Wake him up. 
 If you wake him up, I can be there, right? 
 You can. 
 But he will be confused and stressed.

 Feels like all Ethan and I ever do now is fight. 
 Children don’t need their parents to be buddies. 
 They need limits, structure. 
 You don’t have kids, do you? 
 He’ll die hating me. 
 Taryn, you cannot think like that. 
 We found the last b*llet fragment. 
 It’s deep but stable, so it is very unlikely to cause further brain damage, bleeds, or seizures. 
 We should leave it where it is. 
 You want to leave a b*llet in my son’s brain? 
 Removing it comes with a high risk of lacerating key brain vessels. 
 (SHUDDERS) 
 You can trust them. 
 They’re the best doctors I’ve ever known. 
 Okay. 
 Leave it in. 
 Did you get to see Mason? 
 They’re doing more tests. 
 But I know he’ll be fine. 
 He will. 
 Does Mason play any sports? 
 Uh, basketball. 
 Team captain. 
 Likes to be in charge. 
 So mature for his age. 
 When my husband died, it was Mason who kept me going. 
 Brought me coffee every morning, opened my curtains, helped me get out of bed. 
 I’m a single mom, too. 
 Helluva day to be one, isn’t it? 
 Mm. 
 When did you lose your husband? 
 We divorced two years ago. 
 But not amicably. 
 Divorced. 
 I know it’s not the same, but… I buried my husband. 
 You lost him in the worst possible way, yes. 
 But I doubt you also lost half of your friends, your self-respect, and (SIGHS) the love of your son. 
 I doubt you ever had to tell your son that Daddy was never coming home again. 
 Look, I didn’t mean to… 
 You figured you know me. 
 You’ve experienced pain, so you understand all the pain everybody else has ever felt. 
 I understand pain… 
 Shut up. Right. 
 Someone disagrees with you and you shut them up. 
 You couldn’t let us wave our little signs in peace? 
 You had to come shout us down, and when that didn’t work, you had to sh**t us?! 
 Yes? Yes? 
 You can go first. 
 Why? 
 I’m being polite. 
 It won’t make any difference who hears their news first. 
 We don’t think there is any brain damage. 
 We’re gonna take him back to the O.R. to finish the repairs. 
 Wonderful. Thank you so much. 
 Of course. 
 We have to leave Ethan’s skull off until his brain swelling has gone down, which could be a couple of days from now. 
 Or months. 
 We’ve moved him to intensive care. 
 You can see him now. 
 (SIGHS) 
 (SIGHS) 
 When he was a baby, I used to love watching him sleep. 
 It was the only time he wasn’t bouncing off the walls. 
 The only time I could just look at him. 
 When he was older, if he caught me watching him, he would say that I was weird, and… 
 I just told him how beautiful he was. 
 And that only made me weirder. 
 But he is so beautiful. 
 His eyes moved. They moved. 
 He’s looking at me. That’s good, right? 
 Yes. 
 No, he’s not looking at you. 
 His eyes are deviating to the right. 
 What does that… 
 He’s squeezing my hand. 
 Ethan, honey, Mommy’s here. 
 How hard? Is it getting firmer? 
 Yeah. 
 Ativan. Increase propofol, and we need a C.T. and an E.E.G. 
 He is having a focal seizure which is originating in the left side of the brain, which wasn’t the damaged side, which is very strange. 
 The b*llet fragment must’ve migrated. 
 It was a mistake to leave it in. 
 He’s seizing. 
 This is exactly what he said wouldn’t happen if we left the b*llet in. 
 Exactly. 
 I’m sure he’ll figure out what to do, and… 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
 Who do you have news for? 
 Ms. DiLallo? 
 Good news? 
 Oh, it’s nothing. 
 It’s okay for someone to be happy. 
 I’m expecting. 
 And all’s good. 
 I gave birth on Christmas Eve. 
 All the nurses were singing carols. 
 Kenny joked that the only thing missing were the three wise men. 
 It was hokey and ridiculous. 
 But it was magical. 
 Ethan was three weeks premature. 
 We were having just one last fun weekend, the two of us, and I guess Ethan didn’t like that idea, so I gave birth in a motel room 300 miles from my OB. 
 Left a really good tip for housekeeping. 
 SHAUN: It’s very strange. 
 I was wrong. 
 It’s… very, very strange. 
 (MONITOR BEEPS) 
 No, you weren’t. 
 The fragment’s still stable in location, no severe compression on MCA, no new bleeds. 
 That just means we missed something else. 
 There. 
 Deep in the left thalamus. 
 I wasn’t wrong. 
 I wasn’t wrong. 
 You were. 
 You missed it. 
 No. No, I wasn’t wrong. 
 I would’ve noticed another fragment. 
 There. 
 There was nothing there eight hours ago. 
 Okay, so, it’s just new to this location, which means it’s moving. 
 And based on its trajectory, it’s gonna cause a lot more damage. 
 It’s much deeper than the other. 
 So we can’t get to it. 
 We can’t go through the water drainage system of the boy’s brain because that would mean having to puncture the ventricular wall at the thalamus, and we can’t follow the injury pathway using MRI guidance because the metal in the b*llet rules out the MRI. 
 And we can’t… Shaun, Shaun, just… 
 You are a neurosurgeon, okay? 
 You will know what I have missed. 
 You don’t think you missed anything? 
 No. 
 Then you didn’t. 
 Okay, then… 
 Ethan is probably going to die. 
 (BREATHING SHAKILY) 
 Okay. 
 (SIGHS) 
 This one’s different, huh? 
 Because he is a child? 
 Yeah, yeah, because he’s a child. 
 No. 
 I’ve lost children before. 
 Shaun, every parent has one job, and that’s to keep their kid alive, to keep them from all the horrors in the world. 
 And maybe because you can’t protect Ethan, you think… 
 That’s not rational. 
 No, it’s… (CHUCKLES) 
 It’s not rational, the price of parenthood. 
 But you know what? It’s worth it. 
 If it makes me upset and irrational, it doesn’t sound like it’s worth it. 
 You don’t mean that. 
 I came here to ask for your surgical advice about Ethan, and all you’ve given me is emotional advice about me. 
 Yeah. 
 Because that’s all I got. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 Kellan started playing soccer when he was 7. 
 He loved that jersey so much. 
 Wore it to bed every night. Wouldn’t let us wash it. 
 Then he spilled grape juice on it. 
 A big purple stain. 
 And I got angry at him. 
 I always get a little like this with kids. 
 You know, I think maybe Shaun and Lim can handle it fine without me. 
 If it was Kellan in that ICU, how would you feel if his doctor bailed on him because his kid had spilled grape juice 10 years earlier? 
 Yeah, it’s brutal on you. 
 About a hundredth as brutal as it is on them. 
 So, you agree with Biden on every single issue? 
 No, of course not. 
 But I agree with him on more than one. 
 How many? 
 Where’s the line? 
 Every vote is a compromise. 
 We support the things we think are important, and… rationalize the things that aren’t. 
 Unfortunately, compromise has become a dirty word, which is ironic since that’s the essence of democracy, and the lack of compromise is why I left home. 
 His left foot is cold. 
 It’s pulseless. 
 I got a pulse here. 
 Something’s happening between here and you. 
 Good. 
 Nothing. 
 Good. 
 Nothing. 
 Nothing. 
 It’s his popliteal artery. He must’ve thrown a clot. 
 We have to fix this now or he loses the leg at best. 
 (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) 
 Ethan’s seizures were caused by a different fragment that migrated to the left side of his brain. 
 We weren’t wrong about leaving the other fragment in. 
 So you weren’t incompetent about that, just about completely missing this other fragment? 
 Yes. 
 But the new fragment isn’t stable, and will almost definitely continue to cause damage. 
 So you’ll remove it as soon as possible. 
 It’s too deep to remove. 
 Which means you’ll do what? 
 We’ll keep him on anti-seizure meds and, uh, we’ll monitor him, hope for the best. 
 Monitor? 
 An 8-year-old boy is dying and you’re gonna monitor him? 
 If this was your child, you could live with that? 
 Taryn, they’re doing their… They’re doing nothing! 
 Lea! It’s okay. 
 It’s okay, Shaun. 
 You’re a couple? 
 I made a decision about my son’s life based on your opinion of your boyfriend? 
 Taryn, I’m so sorry.

 Mason is hanging on, but we have used up all the O-neg and A-neg blood. 
 We’re having some medevacked from L.A. 
 How long will that take? 
 Another couple of hours. 
 You don’t think he’ll last that long. 
 We’re hoping. 
 I’m A-negative. 
 Sometimes we can’t. 
 Every parent has an overwhelming need to protect their child from horrors. 
 It’s the price of parenthood. 
 Taryn donated twice the typical amount of blood and Mason needed every drop of it. 
 It’s gonna be a long night. 
 Where are you going? 
 Yeah, you should come with. 
 Where? Ever read “Hansel and Gretel”? 
 That’s what you were reading? 
 I thought you were doing research. 
 The scan showed no sign that the fragment tore major brain tissue, and there are no significant bleeds or clots as it migrated, which means it didn’t cut a new route. 
 It took a trail that was already there. 
 Okay. How is that helpful? 
 It weaved through CSF spaces or sulci in between the brain parenchyma. 
 If so, it left us some breadcrumbs… 
 Heme products staining. 
 Along the way, and we can use a rigid 3-millimeter endoscope, find the trail, and take that trail all the way to the b*llet without damaging the brain. 
 It’s okay, it’s decaf. 
 You shouldn’t feel guilty about being happy. 
 I didn’t feel happy, not right then. 
 I felt… scared. 
 For us? 
 And for me. 
 You two, you’re so different and so… angry. 
 Hmm. 
 But you are so strong, and I’m… 
 You don’t think you’re strong? 
 No. 
 Not strong enough for this. 
 This doesn’t usually happen. 
 This isn’t supposed to happen. 
 And the way we’ve been coping with it has nothing to do with whether we’re good parents.

 There are many things that could go wrong. 
 Okay, so after the baby's born, then you can relax?

 Are you not scared? 
 You're as emotional as anyone. 
 Maybe you don't have access to it, maybe you don't understand...

 I wouldn't have ordered the tests, and Lea would have lost the baby.

 Considering Maxine's age, stopping her heart and placing her on bypass is way too risky. 
 What about robotic-assisted surgery?

 I'm sorry, but should we really be operating on this woman at all? 
 A DNR is one thing, but now we're considering an experimental elective surgery for the sole purpose of facilitating the patient's death. 
 The patient agreed to the device to save her life, not prolong her death. 
 Is that what we're doing when we treat terminally ill patients? 
 She's making a mistake. 
 She's making a choice. 
 Which is hers to make.

 How do you feel? 
 I don't speak ""doctor,"" but if I were a car, fluid leakage would be a problem.

 CLAIRE: There. 
 The clot is in the lower right pulmonary artery. 
 JORDAN: It's small. 
 Could we use TPA to dissolve it? 
 Anticoagulants are too risky during pregnancy. 
 Maybe we just keep an eye on the clot and hope it breaks up on its own. 
 Bed rest increases the likelihood of more clots. 
 I think we should insert an IVC filter. 
 That would trap future clots before they get to the lungs. 
 It's hard to know what the stress of another procedure will do, but I think we should risk it.

 Your bypass? 
 He told me I should go to the nearest emergency room. 
 I was in the park, looking at the cherry trees, and I started feeling funny, so I called… 
 When was this bypass? 
 Um… A month ago. 
 Paul Nakano. 
 I performed his surgery at San Jose General. 
 Mr. Hill, I hope you took a taxi, as I asked you to. 
 It was only three blocks. 
 If you don’t mind, I’d like to get a 12-lead EKG, cardiac CT, and bloodwork. 
 Ordinarily, I’d be thinking about volume overload as the cause… 
 But in this case, sodium and B.U.N. are normal. 
 The next thing I’d look at is a post-op myocardial infarction. 
 But in this case, the troponins are normal. 
 So you know what I’m thinking? 
 Yes. You did your job too damn well. 
 The heart’s been so strengthened from the bypass that it’s revealed a weakness in the valve. 
 It can’t handle the pump pressure.

 No, his core body temperature is stable at 98.5. 
 He rarely has cold feet. I got him socks. 
 You’re gonna need to draw some dotted lines here for me. 
 Okay. Cold feet means impaired circulation, which means constricted blood flow from the heart, which means a damaged vessel. 
 If we try to push the new valve through the damaged area, it will rip open, k*lling him. 
 “Damaged vessel”?

 We got this. 
 Everyone... 
 We're prepared. 
 To keep her in sickness and health,

 We are not having an outdoor wedding. 
 Okay. 
 Hey. 
 Hi. 
 - I had a great time last night. 
 - Me too. 
 Want to go grab some breakfast? 
 I got to get to the hospital. 
 I'm a surgeon. 
 Oh. 
 You look beautiful as always. 
 One plus of only having video chats... 
 No morning breath. 
 I remember it being 
 like a summer breeze. 
 What's on your agenda for the day? 
 Ugh, budget hell. 
 Our department's way in the red, 
 so I don't see a way to... 
 Perhaps I should let you go. 
 No, no. I was, uh... 
 Hoping for a little excitement 
 this morning, 
 but it looks like you're 
 out and about, so... 
 I can make myself available. 
 Excellent. 
 Just give me two minutes 
 to make this go away, yeah? 
 Sure. 
 I can go away, but not in two minutes. 
 So, my lawyer called me last night 
 to tell me I'm no longer a wanted man, 
 which, hopefully, only applies 
 to law enforcement. 
 Nice exposure of the right tonsil. 
 Visibility can be tough with kids. 
 Someone's in a good mood. 
 That's your third compliment

 Oh, she's in a good mood 
 because she had sex.

 Mateo can come to the engagement party

 Also the wedding, 
 depending on how long he is staying. 
 We don't know when it will be, 
 but I do know it will not be outdoors. 
 Incise the tonsillar pillar 
 and dissect around the capsule. 
 Lea is making all of the arrangements

 but all that matters to me 
 is marrying Lea, 
 and any day that happens 
 will be a perfect day. 
 Oh, that's very sweet. 
 But planning a wedding's 
 a big undertaking. 
 Mia got pretty overwhelmed 
 planning ours. 
 Better keep checking in. 
 Oh, there's a firm, irregular mass 
 in this tonsil. 
 Get that to pathology. 
 Some, uh, shortness of breath, 
 occasional blurred vision and headaches, 
 and this morning, my urine was foamy. 
 How many exam rooms in this clinic? 
 Three. Any blood in your urine? 
 A little. I love that blouse. 
 - Chloe? 
 - Cushnie. 
 You take    milligrams

 For my ADHD. 
 Just three? I hardly had to wait at all. 
 Blurred vision and headaches 
 can be side effects from Ritalin. 
 Would you be willing to stop your 
 medication for a couple of days, 
 see if they're causing 
 any of your symptoms? 
 I'll refer any complaints 
 about my behavior to you. 
 Foamy urine concerns me. 
 Could be kidney stones, 
 so we should do a CT... 
 I see by your ID badges 
 you're both residents, 
 but you seem to be more in charge. 
 Is that official, or are you just bossy? 
 Tell me if I'm asking 
 too many questions. 
 You're asking too many questions. 
 We're gonna run some labs 
 and do a CT of your kidneys. 
 Are you overwhelmed 
 planning the wedding? 
 Because Park and Lim thought 
 you might be overwhelmed. 
 Nope, not at all. 
 I've got it. It's gonna be great. 
 Oh, great. 
 That's why they're divorced. 
 I'm also great, because my tonsillectomy 
 may have found something worse 
 than an infection, 
 which may be interesting... 
 Or may still be very boring. 
 I won't know for sure 
 until the path results... 
 Maybe let me know once 
 it's 
 definitely 
 interesting? 
 This is a very small office. 
 Actually, it feels a lot larger 
 when I'm the only one in it.

 Uh, it says so on the sign on your door.

 Renal pelvis looks clean. 
 You sound disappointed. 
 Morgan made me a deal. 
 I do all the scut work. 
 If the patient needs anything surgical, 
 she'll put in a good word 
 with the attending. 
 Even if there's a kidney stone, 
 I mean, surgery's pretty unlikely. 
 But what's that, on the right kidney? 
 That's a significant hypodensity. 
 Could be a mass. 
 She needs a kidney biopsy. 
 That is a legit 
 ultrasound-guided procedure. 
 And it's mine. All mine! 
 Riley's throat... 
 It's still really bothering him. 
 We had to remove additional tissue 
 because your son's tonsils 
 showed signs of cancerous cells. 
 Riley has cancer. 
 The margins were clear, which means that 
 we were able to remove all the cancer. 
 His prognosis is excellent. 
 But right now, 
 he's not our main concern. 
 The cancer on your son's 
 tonsil is cervical cancer. 
 What? 
 That makes no sense. 
 He got it from you. 
 He was exposed to your 
 cancerous cells in the birth canal, 
 which he likely inhaled. 
 Jackson may also have been 
 exposed during birth. 
 We need to scan both you and... 
 - Hey! 
 - Hey, boys. 
 How you feeling, Riley? Hey, Uncle Nick. 
 Why are you here? 
 I texted Uncle Nick that Riley was sick. 
 Everything is fine.

 And if you need anything, I can help. 
 Everything is gonna be fine. 
 It was very nice of Uncle Nick to visit, 
 but he needs to leave.

 - I'm sorry. I just... 
 - No. No, no, no. 
 You did nothing wrong, honey. 
 Nothing at all. 
 But, um... 
 The doctors and I... 
 We need to talk to you. 
 Imaging found an abnormal 
 lesion in your kidney. 
 Now, it could be a benign growth, 
 but given your symptoms, 
 it could be renal-cell carcinoma. 
 We'll need to biopsy the mass 
 to be sure. 
 - Who will be doing the procedure? 
 - Dr. Allen. 
 She's an excellent surgical resident, 
 right, Dr. Andrews? 
 Quite. 
 And she'll be under my 
 supervision every step of the way. 
 If that's acceptable to you, 
 Ms. Morrison. 
 Of course. 
 No eating or drinking 
 anything besides water

 Why did you lie to your brother? 
 You said everything was fine. 
 It's not. 
 He just never grew up.

 Nick wanted to help. 
 He got on great with the kids. 
 He also drank...

 Put down that sandwich! 
 Hi, Dr. Allen. Is it time for my biopsy? 
 I told you not to eat. 
 I forgot. 
 That tends to happen

 Please tell me that was going to be 
 your first bite of that sandwich. 
 My first bite. 
 Of this half. 
 Your cancer appears to be 
 primarily localized 
 to the cervix and uterus. 
 You will need a radical hysterectomy. 
 If the cancer's spread 
 to the lymph nodes, 
 you would also need those removed 
 and post-radiation 
 and possibly chemotherapy. 
 And Jackson? 
 When was the last time 
 you had a Pap smear? 
 Your cancer is quite advanced. 
 Most cervical cancers are detected early 
 with regular Pap smears. 
 I'm a single mom. 
 Things sometimes fall 
 through the cracks. 
 How's my son? 
 Jackson has a tumor in his trachea. 
 There appears to be just one lesion, 
 no lymph-node involvement or metastasis. 
 Surgery will hopefully be curative. 
 And how soon can you do that? 
 There's no rush to do it. 
 It's slow-growing. 
 But there is a rush to do your surgery. 
 Waiting increases your risk 
 of serious bowel injury and metastasis. 
 How long will my recovery take? 
 If all goes well... 
 A month. 
 No. 
 I can't. 
 Who will look after the boys? 
 I... I can't afford a full-time sitter. 
 There's no one that I can ask. 
 Jackson's surgery should go first. 
 And once he's better, you can do mine. 
 Jackson's recovery 
 won't be quick either. 
 He may need to remain 
 intubated while his trachea heals. 
 He won't be able to eat. 
 We'll need to put a tube in his belly. 
 You can help me in a month. Right now... 
 You help my son. 
 Thank you. 
 Are you okay? 
 The engagement party is off. 
 Another bad dream? 
 Another reminder that chaos 
 follows me everywhere. 
 Is the wedding still on? 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Stupid choice. 
 It's not stupid to sacrifice 
 yourself for your child. 
 It's being a parent. 
 Call it whatever you want. 
 We can't force her to do the surgery. 
 So we're gonna have 
 to do Jackson's surgery first 
 and hope for a smooth recovery. 
 You're wrong. 
 Endoscopic mucosal tracheal resection. 
 If Jackson's tumor was seeded 
 via exposure during birth, 
 which is a very reasonable assumption, 
 then we can reasonably assume 
 that it is localized. 
 Endoscopic resection should allow 
 for a recovery of days instead of weeks. 
 Talk to the mother. 
 We have rescheduled your kidney biopsy 
 for  :   this evening. 
 Nothing to eat or drink 
 between now and then. 
 Ms. Morrison, could you stop 
 doing that while we're talking? 
 This helps me relax. 
 I don't care if you're relaxed. 
 I care about the wandering, the eating, 
 and the not listening. 
 - I'm listening. 
 - Repeat what he just said. 
 You've rescheduled my biopsy for  :  . 
 Nothing to eat or drink until then. 
 Is your relationship primarily 
 cooperative or competitive? 
 - Cooperative. 
 - Competitive. 
 He said that because he doesn't 
 want to 
 appear competitive in front... 
 Have you always had fat ankles? 
 Rude! 
 Only if the answer is ""yes."" 
 If the answer is ""no,"" it's a symptom. 
 This endoscopic approach, 
 it's, um, not the normal surgery? 
 There is no normal surgery for removing 
 cervical cancer from a child's trachea. 
 Is it just as safe? 
 Safer. 
 Overall. 
 It's slightly more dangerous 
 for Jackson, 
 but much less dangerous for you. 
 We would need emergent ECMO, 
 but we can prep for that, 
 and his recovery should be shorter. 
 - So... 
 - No. 
 No. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I'm sorry for giving a 
 hard time with Uncle Nick. 
 Oh... 
 I'm sorry for giving a hard time 
 with cleaning up after dinner, 
 fighting with Riley. 
 I know how much you do for us. 
 And I know after the surgery, 
 you won't be able 
 to do all of those things. 
 I can help. 
 I love you. 
 I love you, too. 
 And if anything ever happened to you... 
 - Oh... 
 - I... I'm... 
 Hey. 
 Okay. 
 Swollen ankles could indicate 
 an infectious abscess, 
 which could be the lesion 
 we saw on her kidney imaging. 
 In which case, poking the mass 
 with a biopsy needle 
 is a terrible idea. 
 Could seed the infection. 
 So no biopsy. 
 You'll be relieved to know 
 that even if there was a biopsy, 
 you wouldn't be doing it.

 to reschedule procedures 
 because they allow their patients 
 to wander off to eat sandwiches 
 don't get dibs. 
 Let's recheck C.B.C., E.S.R., 
 blood and urine cultures, 
 and then start her 
 on broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
 If her symptoms improve, 
 then it's an infection, 
 which would be good news. 
 How 
 cooperative you feeling right now? 
 I'm really... sorry. 
 You're at the mass. 
 It has a wide base. 
 No easy way to loop my snare around it. 
 Is it... pulsating? 
 It has a major arterial feeder 
 from his aorta. 
 We can't remove it from this angle 
 without risking a massive bleed. 
 It was a good idea that won't work. 
 Abort the surgery. 
 Ta-da! 
 You look amazing! 
 But wait. 
 You shouldn't look amazing. 
 The party's canceled. 
 I do not accept that, not today. 
 I look amazing, 
 and people need to see that. 
 And unless you caught Shaun cheating, 
 no way you should be here sulking 
 instead of having a party 
 where I look amazing. 
 Did you catch Shaun cheating? 
 No! Of course not. 
 Are you worried about marrying Shaun? 
 No, not at all. 
 I just want this wedding to be perfect. 
 And the party was going 
 to be a trial run. 
 It wasn't going to be perfect. 
 It was going to be a disaster. 
 No. It just wasn't going to be perfect. 
 The first time I got married... 
 I was all about it being spontaneous 
 and romantic and fun. 
 The deejay was an hour late. 
 We ran out of booze, the food was cold, 
 and, somehow, there were no napkins, 
 not a single one. 
 It was a disaster, 
 and so was the marriage. 
 So I-I really need 
 to get this one right. 
 If you aren't willing to risk 
 little things going wrong, 
 you'll never get the chance 
 to have the 
 big 
 things go right. 
 E-mail everyone 
 and tell them the party's back on. 
 Then I'm doing your hair. 
 MMm. 
 If we avoid an abdominal incision, 
 that'd reduce Sarah's recovery time, 
 which might convince her to 
 let us do her procedure first. 
 There may be uterine adhesions 
 to the bladder. 
 That makes a laparoscopic 
 removal difficult. 
 You two, get changed. 
 Engagement party's back on. 
 We are working on a case. 
 Your fiancEe is working on a celebration 
 of your future together. 
 Is someone going to die 
 if you don't figure this out tonight? 
 Maybe. 
 Not good enough. See you at the party. 
 Talk some sense into him. 
 We will solve this problem 
 and 
 then 
 go to the party. 
 It won't take very long. 
 We are both quite clever. 
 The food is happening, 
 bubbly is flowing, 
 flower arrangements are in position. 
 The deejay wouldn't uncancel, 
 so we're streaming chill jazz 
 on your phone. 
 - You're amazing. 
 - Oh. 
 Congratulations, Lea. Hi, Jordan. 
 Thank you. 
 So, where's the man of the hour? 
 Shaun's getting into 
 his party duds as we speak. 
 Got to make sure he 
 measures up to this beauty. 
 I got it. I know how 
 to do Jackson's surgery 
 without cracking his chest. 
 How? 
 It's complicated. 
 I've seen journal articles that 
 support it, and I need to pull them. 
 You go ahead. 
 I'll put everything together. 
 Are you lying about having a solution? 
 Is your future with Lea 
 more important than this one case? 
 Much more. 
 Then do you really want me to answer? 
 Well, where's Shaun? 
 I'd like to toast the two of you. 
 I've got to take this. 
 Yeah. Shaun? 
 Shaun? 
 - Shaun? 
 - This is not a little thing. 
 Paging Dr. Shaun Murphy! 
 Stop yelling. 
 We are all so happy for you. 
 The first time Shaun mentioned Lea, 
 she was the girl 
 who borrowed his batteries. 
 I told him not to ask for them back, 
 but clearly, it worked out. 
 These two have a love that can move... 
 What if we embolize 
 the blood supply to the tumor 
 and then do the endoscopic surgery? 
 If Shaun couldn't figure this out, 
 you really think you're going to? 
 I was hoping you might help, you know, 
 instead of just throwing insults. 
 Even if you come up 
 with a brilliant idea, 
 it still won't work. 
 If medical logic was gonna persuade her, 
 she'd have changed her mind already. 
 This is perfect. 
 Yes, it is. 
 Uh... 
 Um... 
 Look, I know you don't want me here. 
 I have something for you. 
 This is my   -day chip. 
 I haven't had a drink 
 in     days, and... 
 Not my first time getting sober, but... 
 ...I want to be the man I know I can be. 
 I want to be your brother again. 
 You keep it. 
 And whatever you all are going through, 
 it'll be here, just like 
 I'll be here for you... 
 And for the boys... 
 If you'll let me. 
 I'm... Glad you're doing better. 
 Really. 
 But how do I know I can trust you? 
 No, you don't. 
 But... 
 Sarah, you need to trust someone. 
 ♪ You've got me right where you want ♪ 
 ♪ I've got... 
 You couldn't decide, 
 so you ended up with two dates? 
 I got Marie and Maria confused 
 in my text threads 
 and inadvertently double-dipped. 
 Well, it seems like 
 it's going okay so far. 
 Oh, yeah. They're talking 
 about moving on to a club... 
 Without me. 
 They do have real chemistry. 
 How about a double? 
 Yes, please. 
 ♪ Tell me, tell me ♪ 
 ♪ Tell me what can I do ♪ 
 Excuse me. 
 That was SF General. 
 Once the hospital board found out 
 that my original charges 
 included as*ault, 
 they decided I was 
 too big of an insurance risk. 
 Maybe another hospital in the Bay Area. 
 Yeah. 
 Uh, I would like to, um... Make a toast. 
 Uh... 
 I have known Shaun 
 since he was... 
 Littler. 
 And, Shaun, 
 I have never, ever seen you 
 as happy as you are 
 right now with Lea. 
 Well, not that you've always been happy. 
 There have been some ups and downs, 
 a little bit like a roller coaster. 
 But you guys have managed it so well. 
 A whole lot better than I have. 
 Is that funny? 
 Anyway, um... 
 But here's to 
 many, many, many years of... 
 ...of happiness. 
 At least two, maybe three. 
 That was funny. 
 I'm divorced, so that's funny. 
 Yeah, but you're married now, 
 so let's give it up for Shaun... 
 Debbie left me like two months ago, 
 but that's not the point. 
 The point is... 
 You guys have built a-a platform 
 and you've taken off. 
 And that's... 
 I mean, who knows? 
 And, so... 
 - That was fun last night. 
 - Yeah. 
 You want to grab some breakfast? 
 I should get going. 
 Yeah. 
 What's on your mind, guapa? 
 Well... 
 Radical hysterectomy 
 with lymph-node resection 
 on a mom of two boys. 
 I'm just worried about incontinence 
 and fistula post-procedure. 
 Can you preserve 
 the superior vesical artery? 
 That will ensure blood supply 
 to the distal ureter. 
 Is that all you're thinking about? 
 No. 
 It's still swollen, 
 but blood and urine cultures 
 are negative. 
 Rules out infection. 
 Well, it rules out bacterial infection. 
 It could still be fungal or viral. 
 We're better off with 
 an endovascular renal biopsy. 
 Ms. Morrison, 
 we'd like to insert a catheter 
 through your jugular vein 
 to your kidney. 
 That way, we can biopsy the mass safely. 
 Okay. 
 Will you be doing it? 
 Dr. Wolke will be doing the honors, 
 under my guidance. 
 Great. 
 Who's the chief of surgery here? 
 Dr. Audrey Lim. 
 A woman. That's fantastic. 
 Can I meet her? 
 She's a little busy. 
 Dr. Murphy, can you identify 
 the superior vesical arteries? 
 Yes. 
 W-Why? 
 Salvage them. It will ensure 
 blood supply to the distal ureter. 
 That will reduce the risk 
 of incontinence or fistula. 
 Very clever. 
 It is, isn't it? 
 Dr. Lim! 
 Excuse me. Who are you? 
 And what are you doing 
 in my operating room? 
 I'm Salen Morrison. 
 Dr. Andrews thinks I should have 
 an endovascular kidney biopsy. 
 What do you think? 
 It's absolutely the best next step. 
 But what about the possibility of... 
 Ms. Morrison, I don't know 
 anything about your case. 
 But if Dr. Andrews 
 recommends you get a biopsy, 
 then get a biopsy. 
 I have complete faith in him 
 and all of my attendings. 
 Please page Dr. Andrews 
 and have him come get his patient. 
 Oh, I feel... 
 Something's wrong. 
 Stat. 
 What causes kidney lesions, 
 shortness of breath, 
 swollen ankles, 
 and heart irregularities? 
 Early polycystic kidney disease? 
 See, we're just guessing. 
 We need to sample the lesion. 
 Every time we get close to 
 doing the biopsy on this woman, 
 something... doc-blocks us. 
 It's like she's messing with us. 
 Whatever's in her kidney is very real, 
 and she didn't intentionally 
 make her heart rate 
 - go through the roof. 
 - Unless... 
 Look at her blood work. 
 She said she'd stop her meds, 
 but her Ritalin level today is 
 over double when she came in. 
 That could cause 
 her heart irregularities. 
 She 
 is 
 messing with us. 
 You look great. 
 Yeah, Jackson's asleep, 
 but, um, he's doing good. 
 Your surgery went well. 
 Your prognosis is good. 
 You'll receive 
 chemo-radiation treatment. 
 The radiation therapy 
 includes both external beam... 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 I think she was talking to me. 
 Because you brought Nick. 
 Your brother is not perfect. 
 But sometimes, 
 we need people who aren't perfect. 
 I forgot. 
 You do that a lot. 
 This is silly. 
 You must have patients 
 all the time who screw up, 
 don't do what they're told. 
 Do you accuse all of them 
 of being liars? 
 - I didn't think you're a liar. 
 - Thank you. 
 I think you are insane. 
 There's a lesion on your kidney, 
 and you're actively preventing us 
 from finding out what it is. 
 Or she already knows. 
 Or at least she knows enough 
 to put concealing makeup on her fingers. 
 To hide her Raynaud's syndrome. 
 You have scleroderma? 
 So your kidney... 
 That's a benign lesion, not a mass. 
 I got diagnosed seven years ago, 
 after having symptoms for three years. 
 Lots of bad doctors out there. 
 I went off my scleroderma meds 
 a couple weeks ago, 
 see if you doctors 
 were more of the same. 
 Why? 
 I was curious. 
 How do I look? 
 You look like someone 
 about to make a presentation 
 to a hospital board. 
 Perfect. 
 I'm gonna go to my hotel room. 
 No, no. Don't you dare. 
 Either the board is gonna make this 
 a very good night or a very bad night. 
 But, either way, 
 I want you here when I get home. 
 Okay. 
 You know, we have been down an attending 
 for over a year. 
 And I do know 
 a very qualified candidate. 
 If the board gives me the money, 
 I'm gonna offer you a job. 
 And if they don't, screw 'em. 
 I'm gonna offer you a job. 
 The party was a disaster. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, it was. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I screwed up. 
 Shaun, that was not your fault. 
 Oh, no, I know. 
 It wasn't 
 my 
 fault at all. It was 
 yours. 
 It was your party, 
 your responsibility, 
 but that's the problem. 
 When things go wrong for us, 
 they should go wrong for both of us. 
 So I'm going to help you 
 plan our wedding. 
 This way... 
 When it goes terribly wrong, 
 it will be both our faults. 
 And it'll be because of the both of us 
 when everything goes 
 right. 
 What happened? The meeting's over? 
 But my presentation... 
 I haven't had a chance... 
 No one has. 
 There was only one item on the agenda. 
 The hospital is being purchased. 
 What? By who? 
 I'm looking forward to working 
 with both of you."

 of the Ethicure mission. 
 Pillar one, our hospital. 
 A new color palette designed 
 to create a sense of well-being. 
 Cutting edge technologies. 
 Faster testing and imaging results. 
 And countless new surgical innovations. 
 Pillar two, our doctors. 
 We want you healthy and happy,

 Ethicure scrubs, 
 along with a few other goodies. 
 We'll also be introducing 
 new well-being incentives

 Bosses have first names, too. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Which leads us to pillar three. 
 At Ethicure, we do not treat patients. 
 We serve clients. 
 So we will be seeking their feedback

 is a referring client. 
 My name is Salen. 
 Welcome to the Ethicure family. 
 DR. PARK: I really want to break this. 
 Our jobs no longer depend 
 on saving lives, 
 but how many smiley faces get punched. 
 - It's cute. 
 - FEMALE VOICE: 
 Thank you! 
 She's just incentivizing niceness. 
 You of all people do not want 
 to be rated by how nice you are. 
 I can't fake saving lives, 
 but being nice? 
 Way easier to game. 
 It counts your steps, your pulse ox, 
 monitors when you sleep, 
 warns you when you're stressed, 
 and stores a thousand playlists. 
 - If it vibrated, I'd marry it. 
 - Jordan. 
 Ethicure knows where we are, 
 what we're listening to, 
 how we're sleeping, 
 maybe even who we're sleeping with. 
 It also tracks paranoia. 
 You're fine with all of this? 
 I mean, it's great if you are, 
 but change is sometimes tricky for you. 
 I was concerned, 
 but Ethicure's changes seem 
 reasonable and data-driven. 
 I think we should start 
 by picking a cake. 
 You prioritized the cake, 
 over the date, the venue, the caterer... 
 I like cake. 
 I've compiled a list 
 of the most popular ones. 
 What is your favorite cake? 
 Whatever you think our guests will like. 
 There is no such thing as bad cake. 
 Whew. Take a good look. 
 You won't be seeing 
 much of me for a while. 
 I'll be very busy turning 
 a good program into a bad one. 
 Yeah.

 She's hemorrhaging. 
 Ultrasound to assess etiology. 
 Hanging blood and fluids,

 - Do you know I completed my residency?

 Blame SurgiMatch. 
 I mean, I wouldn't have 
 put you on the schedule at all 
 until you at least knew 
 where the bathrooms were. 
 Oh, come on, 
 guapa, 
 look at all this stuff. 
 I'm a kid in a candy store

 Please don't call me

 Yes, Audrey. 
 - Bosses have first names, too.

 This thing did a great job 
 filling up my dance card 
 for the next week. 
 She knows what I like. 
 Good to have you on board. 
 Glad to be here. 
 Not all of our dance cards are full. 
 Mind if I tag along 
 on your morning rounds, 
 maybe show me where the bathrooms are? 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 - Sure. 
 Let's cha-cha. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 DR. PARK: I looked up her case. 
 Abby Clemmis was charged 
 with poisoning her baby with antifreeze. 
 She pleaded not guilty and got 
 pregnant again before the trial. 
 But when she was convicted, 
 her boyfriend, like everybody else, 
 stopped believing her. 
 DR. REZNICK: Oh, boo-hoo. 
 Stay focused. You're now being timed. 
 All part of the productivity metric. 
 Forget the timer. 
 It takes as long as it takes. 
 (INHALES DEEPLY) 
 I like knowing how long it takes. 
 (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 (SIGHS) 
 It was probably postpartum depression. 
 Doesn't make the baby any less dead. 
 But we might have a little sympathy. 
 Because women are helpless 
 victims of our hormones? 
 Like people who should be 
 treated rather than punished. 
 What's your favorite cake? 
 Lea and I need to pick a cake 
 for our wedding. 
 Angel food cake. 
 Packing peanuts have more flavor. 
 SALEN: Anything with 
 cream cheese frosting. 
 I'd eat dog poop with that on it. 
 Oh, please, uh, don't let me 
 distract you. 
 So, Salen, it's great to see you again. 
 I loved how you kicked 
 the tires on this place. 
 Nice due diligence. 
 (BABY CRYING) 
 (SALEN SIGHS) What a beautiful sound. 
 Discharge them. 
 Uh, we have a   -hour 
 post-op monitoring policy. 
 And now we have a new policy. 
 As soon as they're stable, 
 you'll discharge them, 
 to make way for other clients in need.

 This is Madeline, came in 
 experiencing dizziness 
 and severe nausea after 
 running in a college track meet. 
 And winning the     meter. (LAUGHS) 
 Urine analysis and 
 abdominal X-ray were normal. 
 I could try a G.I. cocktail 
 to rule out gastritis. 
 Sit back here. 
 Any pain here? 
 (GRUNTS) I just set a state record. 
 It's heat exhaustion and dehydration. 
 You sprint in full face? 
 I doubt my makeup could run 
 faster than I do. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 - I ran track in college. 
 - Mmm? 
 - I found the makeup 
 - really helped. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 You feel well enough 
 to step up on the scanner? 
 Yeah. 
 Inset your hand here. 
 (SCANNER CHIMES) FEMALE VOICE: 
 Scanning. 
 (SCANNER BEEPS) 
 It even knows 
 what you had for breakfast. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 - DR. ANDREWS: Perfusion's good, 
 pulses are strong. 
 Not surprisingly, you're in 
 top physical condition. 
 (CHUCKLES) I told you, it's just... 
 (COUGHING) 
 She's hypoxic! 
 We need to suction 
 and protect her airway. 
 (GASPING) 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 Meggie, my baby... 
 She's fine. 
 Seven pounds, three ounces, 
 and, uh, the lungs of an opera singer. 
 Can I see her? 
 Just a peek through a window, 
 anything... 
 That's not possible. 
 We're gonna start 
 processing your discharge. 
 After we run a few more tests, 
 just to be safe. 
 I know you're feeling 
 overwhelmed right now, 
 and I'm sure you'll be 
 experiencing anxiety, sadness. 
 If you do suffer 
 from postpartum depression, 
 you'll need to get help. 
 I sure didn't have that with Troy. 
 Those were the most wonderful 
 days of my life. 
 So, that means I'm either 
 a victim or a monster. 
 Pick a side. 
 We stopped the bleeding, 
 but your CT confirmed 
 a lesion in your lung. 
 Which may be benign, but we 
 have to do a biopsy to know for sure. 
 If I had a lesion in my lung, 
 wouldn't that be slowing me down? 
 The rest of your lung is healthy 
 and compensating very well. 
 Any history of lung disease 
 in your family? 
 - I don't know. 
 - A medical history can help 
 dictate diagnostic 
 and treatment options. 
 Can we contact your family? 
 No, um... my parents are... 
 - They're... 
 - JORDAN: Your mother's here. 
 (IN AFRICAN ACCENT) 
 Are you okay, Madeline? 
 That's not my mother. 
 My parents died two years ago. 
 I was a toddler when she 
 gave me up for adoption, 
 and then went back to Cameroon... 
 I didn't give you up. I was deported. 
 I let you stay in America so 
 you could have a better life. 
 (SPEAKING FRENCH) 
 Welcome back. I worked 
 in Cameroon for a while. 
 Is it okay if Esther gives us 
 some medical history? 
 Does anyone in your family 
 have high blood pressure? 
 I do. Is that the problem? 
 I told her she had to 
 watch what she eats. 
 She won't listen to me. 
 And why should I? 
 I barely know you. 
 Showing up at my track meets 
 doesn't make you a mother, Esther. 
 - What about high cholesterol? 
 - No. 
 In Cameroon, you don't call elders 
 - by their first name. 
 - (CHUCKLING) Okay. 
 And you don't show everyone 
 all your goodies. 
 Your ""parents"" didn't teach you respect. 
 Abby needs ""a few more tests""? 
 You just don't want 
 to send her back to prison. 
 If she'd been getting decent healthcare, 
 they would've caught 
 the placenta previa long ago. 
 So if I can delay sending 
 Abby back there, I will. 
 We're discharging her 
 as soon as possible. 
 Look at this. 
 Hypotonia? 
 She's taking very little nutrition. 
 Maybe ultrasound her 
 for a G.I. tract obstruction? 
 We could change the formula. 
 She might just be a picky eater. 
 Good point. I'll try that. 
 Right after the ultrasound. 
 Aaron. 
 Ooh, fishing flies. 
 Please don't touch. 
 It's harder than brain surgery. 
 Ow! (INHALES SHARPLY) 
 (SIGHS) 
 Your absence at the 
 presentation this morning 
 could be interpreted 
 as a lack of support. 
 You think? 
 When we first met, 
 you were a fake patient, 
 and now you're 
 a hostile corporate raider. 
 This hostile corporate raider 
 saved your hospital 
 from being turned into condos. 
 I resign. 
 And I hate your new logo. 
 You've got a very loyal following, 
 many of whom will be very 
 opposed to this takeover. 
 You leaving could have 
 a snowball effect. 
 My board of directors... and I 
 think it's important for you to stay on. 
 So you can draw on my expertise? 
 Or because you want a puppet? 
 Either way, you've got decent leverage. 
 Normally, I'd be offering stock options, 
 salary incentives, 
 definitely a larger office, 
 but I suspect none of those will work. 
 So maybe, despite it being a money hole, 
 I'll just keep your clinic open. 
 How's that? 
 Think about it. 
 Your baby's not 
 getting enough nutrition. 
 Her ultrasound was clear. 
 I think Meggie needs her mother's milk. 
 Hey. 
 Hey, sweetie. 
 The biopsy confirmed 
 the mass in your lung 
 is malignant melanoma, 
 stage four. 
 Your PET scan show 
 it's also in the lymph nodes 
 of your neck, abdomen, and pelvis. 
 We'll remove what we can 
 and follow up with molecular 
 and immunotherapies, 
 but... 
 The prognosis isn't good. 
 Even with all targeted treatments, 
 you're unlikely to live 
 more than    months. 
 No. 
 I'm healthy. I'm strong. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 Pray, Madeline. We have to pray. 
 God will work through these doctors. 
 No! 
 I can't be dying. 
 I'm going to nationals. 
 This can't be right. It's a mistake. 
 (PRAYING IN FRENCH) 
 Stop praying! 
 Stop pretending like you care about me. 
 You left me. 
 I do care. I love you... 
 No! My real mother 
 loved me and accepted me. 
 I am your mother, 
 and right now, you need... 
 No, I don't need anything from you. 
 You're nothing. 
 Please go away. 
 (BEEPING) 
 She's vomiting. Cyanotic 
 and O  stats are plummeting. 
 She's tachycardic. 
 Intubate. 
 (BEEPING CONTINUES) 
 CBC, BMP, stool sample, and echo. 
 And a tox screen for the mother. 
 What's with the tox screen? 
 The mother's fine. 
 I didn't change the baby's formula. 
 I let Abby breastfeed her. 
 I'm wondering if there's 
 something in that breast milk 
 that made the baby sick. 
 More likely it was antifreeze. 
 Right. She smuggled antifreeze 
 into the hospital, 
 from prison, under armed guard? 
 It'd be insane. 
 Like people who poison their babies. 
 We'll be using 
 a basic Ranked-Choice Vote. 
 It's not as nuanced 
 as the Kemeny-Young Method, 
 which minimizes the sum 
 of the Kendall Tau distances 
 to the voters' lists, 
 but I decided that would be 
 too confusing for you. 
 DR. OSMA: Intralesional injection? 
 Madeline's melanoma is too widespread. 
 Only used for locoregional disease. 
 - This carrot cake is amazing. 
 - Mmm. 
 How about peptide vaccine? 
 Very high risk for immune 
 att*cks against normal tissue. 
 Ugh. Does anybody really like 
 red velvet cake? 
 It reminds me of a dumb model, 
 it's delicious-looking 
 but not worth the calories. 
 Mmm. 
 Complete lymph node dissection. 
 The lymphedema would be intolerable. 
 People die here, too, you know? 
 It's my first day. 
 I haven't learned that yet. 
 Wait, there's no way this thing 
 knows I'm eating dessert, right? 
 I have been thinking about cake all day.

 Oh, don't let me interrupt you.

 You have an interesting affect. 
 Are you on the autism spectrum? 
 Please fill out your ballot. 
 I'm neuroatypical myself.

 Okay. 
 You should look at 
 Engineered T Cell therapy.

 I've polled    people. 
 The cakes that got the most ""loves""

 I'm thinking of taking a break, 
 of moving on. 
 On to fishing? 
 Maybe. Maybe not. 
 Uh, probably not. 
 I don't really like fishing. 
 I have no idea what I'm gonna do. 
 Are you sad about Debbie? 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, I am. But you know what? 
 She wasn't happy, 
 so it's probably for the best, 
 and right now, I just think I 
 want to take some time for myself. 
 You want to be alone? 
 I like people. 
 I just think I need to be 
 around different people. 
 - Different from me? 
 - No. No. 
 I just think I need 
 a big change, you know? 
 Well, there are plenty of changes here. 
 Yeah, none that I like, 
 except maybe the iced coffee, 
 surprisingly good for a cafeteria. 
 How are you coping? 
 I need you to help me 
 pick the right cake. 
 Shaun, it's your wedding. 
 Be selfish. Pick the cake that you like.

 I've got no wife. I've got no kid. 
 I'm soon to have no job. 
 And I could get really depressed, 
 but I'm not gonna do that. 
 I'm gonna embrace it. 
 I'm gonna embrace freedom. 
 And for once in my life, 
 I'm not gonna care about anything else. 
 I'm glad you have 
 such a positive outlook. 
 You didn't help with the cake. 
 We've scheduled your surgery, 
 after which, we'll start you 
 on an aggressive course of 
 molecular and immunotherapy. 
 So you'll make me sicker first,

 It's an experimental treatment 
 that teaches your immune 
 system to fight the cancer. 
 Your body could cure itself. 
 You're off my case. 
 The technology's here. 
 The trial is available. Why not use it? 
 You were there to observe and learn, 
 not diagnose and treat. 
 You're not her doctor. 
 She doesn't have specific mutations 
 for most molecular therapies to work... 
 He offered her a treatment 
 that wasn't approved 
 by me, you, or the FDA. 
 That's a violation of protocol, 
 not to mention, it... 
 The Wi-Fi's good in here, right? 
 Just need to answer some e-mails. 
 Oh, please, continue your discussion. 
 Sorry for the overstep, Marcus, 
 but I do feel T Cell therapy 
 is a more effective option. 
 Well, Mateo, the trials were isolated, 
 small sample, and not very encouraging. 
 Infection could k*ll her 
 way before the cancer would. 
 And what about the patient? 
 What does she want? 
 It was presented to her as a 
 somewhat magical solution. 
 - Sh... 
 - I like magic. 
 Did you want to weigh in? 
 Oh, no. I'm... I'm not a doctor. 
 I do have two doctorates, though, 
 neurotech and data science.

 You obviously don't come

 Audrey is a highly principled

 You re-ran all the baby's tests? 
 Using gas chromatography analysis. 
 In case we missed something. 
 Good call. 
 The baby's still in critical condition. 
 If it is antifreeze, 
 why isn't she getting better? 
 I have no idea. 
 Same, same, same. 
 I've solved it. 
 We will stack all five varieties

 Yes, four. Not five. 
 Five flavors, four tiers, 
 because Devil's food

 one uses natural cocoa

 which is alkalized 
 with potassium carbonate. 
 A very minor molecular difference. 
 They're not the same. 
 (BEEPING) 
 A very minor molecular difference. 
 It's not antifreeze. 
 It's propionic acid, 
 which appears identical to antifreeze 
 on all tests except gas chromatography. 
 Propionic acid is made by the body, 
 if that body happens to be afflicted 
 with methylmalonic acidemia, 
 which is a genetic condition. 
 Her first baby probably had it, too. 
 It was Abby's breast milk, 
 not because it contained a toxin, 
 but because it contained proteins 
 that triggered production of the acid.

 Damn. That's gonna be awesome. 
 That we get to help him. 
 It's also going to be 
 some very cool surgeries. 
 COMPUTER: Thank you. 
 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) 
 Surgery number one will be a creation of 
 a submental airway. 
 The new soap smells awful 
 and it takes too long to rinse. 
 - Do you agree? 
 - I like it. 
 Surgery number two will be an ORIF 
 to repair his 
 nasoorbitoethmoid frontal bone 
 and sinus fractures. 
 And the jet air hand dryers 
 are too loud, 
 and they aerosolize germs, 
 increasing their spread. 
 They're better for the environment, 
 and if you've washed properly, 
 there shouldn't be any germs to spread. 
 Okay, you're wrong. 
 I'll show you the research 
 before I talk to Salen. 
 The third and final surgery will be ORIF 
 of the bilateral 
 mandible fractures, ZMC, 
 and complex repair 
 of all orbital fractures 
 with free tissue transfer, 
 customized miniplates, 
 and PEEK implants. 
 This is gonna be awesome. 
 You're gonna talk to Salen 
 about the hand dryers? 
 And the soap and scrubs. 
 Start prepping him 
 for the submental airway 
 while I brief Dr. Lim. 
 There's new soap? 
 The device was implanted 
 into my skull two years ago. 
 And you're still 
 experiencing the seizures. 
 No. 
 For the first time in my life, 
 I'm able to go on walks alone, 
 drive a car, actually interact 
 with clients at work. 
 Well, if it's working so well, 
 why 
 does Dr. Karlson want to take it out? 
 The company that made the implant 
 wants to turn it off. 
 MATEO: That doesn't make any sense. 
 They can't force her to have it removed. 
 Yeah, but they can stop 
 the software updates it needs to work, 
 which could make her seizures 
 even worse. 
 (SIGHS) The implant's 
 an experimental prototype. 
 Worked only for a tiny 
 percentage of patients, 
 which makes it not profitable 
 enough to continue support. 
 - That's absurd. 
 - It's evil. 
 It's capitalism. 
 Karlson's right. It has to come out. 
 But he's wrong that going back 
 to the old meds 
 is her best treatment option. 
 What if we swapped the RNS device 
 for a vagal nerve stimulator? 
 She already had one. Didn't work. 
 I was thinking laser 
 interstitial thermal therapy. 
 Would only be partially effective. 
 She was having    seizures a day. 
 ""Partially"" can make 
 a big difference in her life. 
 Not big enough. 
 (SIGHS) 
 What about combining 
 multiple subpial transections 
 within the eloquent cortex 
 with intraoperative ECoG 
 to resect the adjacent seizure focus? 
 That would be complex, and being 
 even a few millimeters off target 
 could leave her a hemiplegic. 
 Could happen... 
 If another surgeon was doing it. 
 I'm confident with you at 
 the helm, we can pull it off. 
 Trying to ""manage up""

 It's invaded the motor strip,

 Severe necrosis and edema, 
 and no way to see where 
 tumor ends and brain begins. 
 [SIGHS] It's inoperable. 
 I will definitely get a bad review. 
 I need more time 
 to find a surgical solution. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 But we also need to leave 
 for our tux fitting. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 We were able to bypass the renal artery 
 using one of your veins. 
 But new imaging showed 
 you have a condition called 
 Fibromuscular Dysplasia. 
 It's caused areas 
 of stenosis and aneurysm 
 in your heart, brain, 
 and other major vessels. 
 We can give you medication 
 to manage the underlying condition, 
 but we'll have to do another surgery 
 to repair each of the aneurysms. 
 There are risks of stroke, 
 or major hemorrhage. 
 But without it, 
 it's only a matter of time 
 before one of these aneurysms ruptures. 
 [EXHALES SHAKILY] Um, 
 if anything goes wrong, 
 can you please let Teo know? 
 He should be the one to tell my family. 
 I wouldn't want them 
 to hear it from a stranger. 
 Of course. 
 We could use intraoperative 
 stimulated raman histology 
 to determine tumor tissue versus normal. 
 PARK: Eh, if we resect normal tissue, 
 we can't put it back in. 
 Drape is perfect with your physique. 
 Intraoperative MRI guidance 
 would help us achieve 
 gross total resection. 
 And risk resecting eloquent 
 cortex, with major deficits. 
 [SIGHS] You look like a little boy. 
 The shoulder sag is awful. Take it off. 
 That was neither appeasing 
 nor affirming. 
 But your reviews are exceptional. 
 You can't just tell people 
 what they want to hear. 
 You've got to give them 
 the cold, hard truth. 
 I always do that, and people 
 don't give me good reviews. 
 You have to follow it with a compliment, 
 which now, thanks to your honesty, 
 they'll believe. 
 Very striking with those eyes. 
 I... do believe you. 
 GLASSMAN: Yeah, hey, Shaun. 
 Um, sorry for not replying. 
 You're late for the tux fitting. 
 Oh, yeah, um... 
 I'm in Montana? 
 We need to reschedule your appointment. 
 When will you be back? 
 Well, I'm not so sure. 
 I'm heading towards 
 a little town called Paradise, 
 and I'm... 
 I'm thinking of hunkering down 
 there for a little while. 
 How about Wednesday,   :   p.m.? 
 Will you be done hunkering by then? 
 Sure. [SCOFFS] I'll see what I can do. 
 [LIGHTS BUZZING] 
 You are confirmed. Goodbye. 
 We have to get back to the 
 hospital and talk to Mr. Song. 
 With only chemo and radiation, 
 you would die soon. 
 But I've found a way to remove the tumor 
 using fluorescent light. 
 If we administer  -ALA before surgery, 
 the cancer cells will turn 
 pink under the light. 
 Then we can resect those cells 
 and leave healthy tissue unharmed. 
 You will likely have paralysis 
 on your right side, 
 but no cognitive or speech impairment. 
 [SIGHS] 
 No. 
 I've always taken care of myself. 
 Without this procedure, 
 you'd have a year at most. 
 I'd better make it count, then. 
 No surgery.

 I'm not sure I would be this nice

 Mateo told you about us? 
 No, but you're his type. 
 Beautiful. Smarter than he is. 
 And Dr. Wolke let something slip. 
 Ah. 
 I can't quite picture Teo here. 
 Everything is very

 Mm.

 No. 
 We met in Guatemala. 
 And then he decided to move. 
 [CHUCKLES] It was a little... 
 Romantic? 
 - Crazy. 
 - [CHUCKLES] Yes. 
 He moves fast 
 when he knows what he wants. 
 We were practically living 
 together by our third date. 
 Were you together a long time? 
 Six months, maybe less. 
 Long enough for me to start imagining 
 what our kids would be like. 
 But then there was a w*r in Congo 
 or an earthquake in Haiti. 
 Someone, somewhere needed him. 
 But I am glad he's found 
 a place to settle down. 
 I wasn't sure that would 
 ever happen for him.

 You left me. At the party? 
 I was tired and bored. I went home. 
 Without saying goodbye. 
 I was about to introduce you 
 to Dr. Chandra. 
 I didn't ask you to do that. 
 And I didn't ask you 
 to tell that guy from Stanford 
 that I've done 
 over    robotic surgeries, 
 or give that research fellow 
 my ABSITE scores. 
 It's calling mingling. 
 Felt more like being pimped out. 
 What can I say? You're a stud. 
 I'm fine. I'm good. 
 My scores are average, 
 and it's driving you crazy. 
 You're not average, but you 
 shy away from the spotlight. 
 You're a hot Korean 
 martial artist surgeon, 
 and your face isn't on a poster. 
 Why do you think that is? 
 I just want you to reach 
 your full potential. 
 I mean, don't you want that 
 for yourself? 
 ASHER: Rough night? 
 - Not really. 
 - Oh. 
 You know, when I don't sleep well, 
 it's usually anxiety about work 
 or why some hot guy 
 isn't texting me back, 
 or, oh, he sent his 
 ex-girlfriend to me for help. 
 I was up late prepping for this surgery. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
 I have moisturizer in my bag, 
 just, if you want it. 
 Where is she? 
 Rosa was stable, so I transferred her 
 to County Hospital this morning. 
 She's my patient, and I'm your boss. 
 This is the right call 
 for our department. 
 She'll get the care she needs, 
 and as a non-profit... 
 Their team has far less experience 
 with this kind of surgery. 
 I know this patient 
 is important to Mateo, 
 and he's important to you, 
 but we cannot allocate 
 our limited resources 
 based on personal feelings. 
 Oh, this has nothing to do with Mateo. 
 You are risking a woman's life 
 so you can crawl further up Salen's ass. 
 I'm protecting this department, 
 which is actually your job. 
 Pedes just hired three new nurses. 
 I got approval for a portable X-ray. 
 When's the last time Salen 
 approved one of your requests? 
 This is a hospital, not a swap meet. 
 It's her hospital. 
 I'm contacting County. 
 You can't bring her back here. 
 I know. 
 What about a limited 
 temporal lobe resection?

 of future brain herniation? 
 Good for preserving motor function, 
 but he'd likely lose speech. 
 Why is my dad still here? 
 He isn't telling me anything. 
 Emily, the break room is 
 for surgical residents only. 
 Your presence is not only 
 prohibited, it is unwelcome. 
 You're distracting us from 
 trying to change your dad's mind, 
 and save his life. 
 That sweater is very striking 
 with your eyes. 
 You should talk to him. 
 So he can tell me everything's fine? 
 He needs you. 
 I used to be a cop. 
 In part to try and please my dad. 
 He was all about being tough. 
 He always had this, uh, 
 wall up, you know? 
 He came over with nothing. 
 Didn't know the language. 
 He got by on very little 
 for a long time. 
 It took a while for me to realize it, 
 but being tough 
 was just a survival strategy. 
 My dad came here when he was 
 and went ""from a socket wrench 
 and a couple bolts 
 to Number One Convenience 
 Hardware in the Bay, 
 no problem."" 
 I get that he's strong 
 because he had to be. 
 And I get 
 that it helps him to deny how 
 the world sees us as ""other."" 
 But when you do that, 
 it can make people 
 who are struggling feel 
 messed-up and... 
 Alone. 
 Maybe he's protecting you 
 not because he thinks you're weak 
 but because he'd rather take 
 on the world all by himself 
 than see you get hurt. 
 Your dad's a fighter, Emily. 
 But so are you. 
 And he needs you 
 to fight for him right now. 
 Why haven't you told your daughter 
 what you're going through? 
 When she was a little girl, 
 she'd help out at the shop. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Make a mess, more like, 
 disappear in the middle 
 of stocking fasteners. 
 I'd find her hiding behind the counter. 
 Someone said something mean, 
 made her feel bad. 
 That's... That's the world. 
 I sell hammers to people who hate me. 
 I get their money, 
 they get their hammers. 
 I kept my head down, 
 built a life for our family, for her. 
 So, when I'd see her upset, 
 I'd tell her, ""Hey, 
 forget that guy. 
 Focus on the next customer."" 
 I don't want her to hurt. 
 I need to be strong for her. 
 Mr. Song, 
 the best way to show your 
 daughter what strength is... 
 Tell her what you're going through. 
 She's not the little girl 
 hiding behind the counter anymore. 
 - [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 - Mm. 
 I heard you're doing 
 Rosa's surgery at County. 
 I would like to assist. 
 You don't have any surgical 
 privileges at County. 
 And unless you want to piss off the CEO, 
 you shouldn't do it anyway. 
 Maybe you shouldn't, either. 
 You don't know when Dr. Rendon 
 is coming back, do you? 
 Before I got into this program, 
 I had heard so much about you, 
 how you were smart and talented and 
 tough and fair. 
 And at first, I was like, 
 ""Oh, my God. Stop. I get it."" 
 But... 
 But I didn't. 
 Until I met you. 
 Everyone who works for you 
 is a better doctor because of it. 
 And I would hate 
 to see you put everything 
 you've worked for on the line 
 for someone who 
 isn't willing to do the same for you. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't ever give me advice again. 
 Whatever you and Jordan said 
 has improved the situation. 
 How did you do it? 
 I just affirmed 
 where Emily was coming from 
 and helped her see where 
 her dad was coming from, too. 
 That's what I tried to do, 
 and it made them both angry. 
 There's some shared experiences. 
 Because you're both Asian. 
 American, yeah. 
 Both second generation, similar fathers. 
 You're both outsiders. 
 Yeah. I guess that's, uh... 
 Um, my dad 
 told me about the tumor. 
 Did you convince him 
 to accept the surgery? 
 The thought 
 of losing him terrifies me. 
 But he needs my support now. 
 Which means supporting his decision. 
 Thank you for helping me see that. 
 I was wrong. 
 What you and Jordan said 
 has made the situation worse. 
 SHAUN: My clients are finally 
 in agreement with each other. 
 But against me. 
 I'm sorry, Shaun. 
 I love the tuxes, but where's Glassman? 
 Oh, he is ""hunkering down"" in Paradise. 
 Dr. Park, Emily, and I 
 are all outsiders, 
 but I failed to connect with her, 
 and Dr. Park succeeded. 
 To connect with people, 
 I need them to like me, 
 which they do not. 
 I need new strategies. 
 Shaun, I know you grew up 
 not feeling accepted, 
 you didn't have many friends... 
 No. I did not have any friends. 
 Maybe the scores are bringing up 
 some of those old, painful feelings? 
 The scores are providing useful data 
 to help me track my progress. 
 Many people like you. 
 Why do you think that is? 
 Shaun, 
 obsessing over 
 whether or not people like you 
 is a guaranteed trip to Crazytown. 
 That is very easy to say 
 when you are likeable. 
 You're an amazing doctor, 
 which any functioning, decent 
 algorithm should recognize. 
 If I just talked to Salen, I... 
 No. I don't want you to do that. 
 It might be simpler. 
 Do you think I can't improve my scores? 
 Of course not. 
 I know you can. 
 [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] 
 Mm. I have to go. 
 [ALARM BEEPING] 
 PARK: Securing the airway. 
 Give another two milligrams Lorazepam. 
 What's happening? 
 The seizures and brain 
 herniation will only get worse 
 as the tumor grows. 
 All we can do now is keep him 
 in a medically induced coma. 
 Until the tumor kills him. 
 Without waking up first? 
 There's nothing you can do? 
 You are his medical proxy. 
 Now, your dad rejected surgery 
 when he thought he still had time. 
 It's possible he'd make 
 a different choice now. 
 He made it clear he didn't want 
 to live weakened in any way. 
 He'd hate me for choosing 
 the surgery for him. 
 I can't. 
 That is a very bad, 
 very irrational decision. 
 It doesn't matter 
 if your father hates you. 
 Being liked doesn't matter, 
 and worrying about that is 
 a guaranteed trip to Crazytown. 
 What matters is saving your dad's life. 
 Your watch is 
 a very nice shade of orange. 
 Teo's lucky to have you. 
 I told him he better not 
 screw this one up. 
 - You talked to him? 
 - Mm. Earlier today. 
 Only for a minute. 
 He said he'll be back soon. 
 Hopefully. 
 The nurse will come by 
 in a couple minutes 
 to take you to the O.R. 
 - [VOICEMAIL BEEPS] 
 - Hello, Dr. Glassman, 
 you haven't accepted the calendar invite 
 for the rescheduled tux fitting. 
 Should I send another one? 
 Also, in attempting to improve 
 my performance with my clients, 
 I have not many progress, even though... 
 EMILY: Dr. Murphy? 
 You were right. 
 Nothing matters except saving my dad. 
 Do the surgery. 
 Ignore the part about 
 not making progress, 
 but please respond about 
 the calendar invite. 
 [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
 We got over   % of the tumor, 
 and your prognosis is very good. 
 As expected, we weren't able 
 to preserve full motor strength 
 in your left arm and leg. 
 Who... 
 I told them to. 
 Appa, 
 I couldn't stand to lose you. 
 I know you may never forgive me 
 or speak to me again, 
 but at least I know you're still here 
 on the planet with me. 
 That decision... 
 ...took a lot of strength. 
 Good thing my daughter's so tough. 
 Wonder where I got that from. 
 Everything went well. 
 I was able to repair 
 each of the aneurysms. 
 We should have you home 
 in a week, maybe less. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Yeah. 
 How did it end, between you and Mateo? 
 It's none of my business. [CHUCKLES] 
 You don't have to answer that 
 if you don't want to. 
 He would go on medical 
 missions all the time, 
 sometimes with no notice. 
 I would wake up and find a little gift, 
 like a book or a bottle of wine, 
 and a sweet note. 
 After a few days, or weeks, 
 he would come back, 
 and everything would be good. 
 And then one time, he didn't. 
 I waited for a long time. 
 Too long. 
 Thank you. 
 You want to get some dinner? 
 I make a fairly average lasagne. 
 Ah, I have to finish this 
 proposal for Dr. Chandra's lab. 
 Unless you want to work on it together. 
 I'm good. 
 You know, the day I handed in my badge, 
 my dad told me I was weak. 
 And then he didn't say 
 anything else to me for a year. 
 I was only able to do it because of him. 
 I'd watched him make 
 tough choices my whole life. 
 It cost me a lot to get here, 
 but I'm finally in a good place. 
 I love my work 
 and my pain-in-the-ass girlfriend. 
 I don't know if that's 
 ""reaching my full potential,"" 
 but I'm happy. 
 And I fought too hard for that 
 to let anyone tell me it's not enough. 
 Even the person 
 who makes me the happiest. 
 I'll eat the lasagne. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 [SIGHS] I need to know 
 at some point ""good"" 
 is gonna be good enough. 
 For you. For us. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 I'm ambitious. 
 That doesn't mean I'm broken. 
 I think you're unhappy. 
 As long as I've known you, 
 you've been reaching for

 Will it ever be enough?

 Did transferring that

 crappy? 
 It was the right call. 
 Yeah. 
 Pretty crappy. 
 A few years ago, 
 a colleague made me take 
 one of those online tests that 
 tells you if you're a sociopath. 
 Mm. 
 Oh. [CHUCKLES] 
 - I'm not. 
 - [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 I'm just committed. 
 Allowing feelings to influence 
 business decisions leads to... 
 Bad decisions. 
 Yes. Exactly. 
 You think like somebody 
 who knows how to be in charge. 
 So why aren't you anymore? 
 I made a good call. 
 The board made a bad one. 
 Would you like to have dinner? With me. 
 Before you answer, you should 
 know that going out with me 
 will not benefit you 
 professionally in any way. 
 Or personally, maybe. 
 Who's to say? 
 And turning me down 
 will have no repercussions. 
 Feelings do not influence business. 
 I can sign something to that effect. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'd love to have dinner with you. 
 Excellent. 
 Do you like shawarma? 
 I know the best shawarma place. 
 Oh, I love their chicken,

 Are you here to take my measurements?

 I can't allow that. 
 Morgan's on call this weekend. 
 You and I are going out...

 Two de facto bachelors

 Hi. 
 We've got a patient in the ER 
 who's severely injured, 
 and he's O-negative. 
 And the heart? 
 Seems to be healthy. 
 The patient is an adult, 
 but not a big guy. 
 Oh. 
 Do you think it'll fit Ollie? 
 I think so. 
 But I need you to bring him in 
 for another CT to be sure. 
 W-we're just about to leave 
 for Ollie's Make-A-Wish trip. 
 We've got a cardiology team 
 and a very accommodating paleontologist. 
 (SIGHS) 
 And other hearts have fallen through. 
 This trip won't happen again. 
 Not with the amount of time he has left. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Should we get on this plane, or not? 
 Bring him in. 
 Okay. 
 We managed to slow your son's bleeding, 
 but Brandon has a lot 
 of internal injuries, 
 so we won't know the full 
 extent until we look inside. 
 Do you have any questions? 
 No. 
 - You've been very clear. 
 - (CELLPHONE BUZZES) 
 We're ready to move him 
 to the operating room, 
 so I'll find you when I know more. 
 Can I talk to my son? 
 Before the surgery. 
 I'm sorry, uh, 
 he's been unconscious since his fall. 
 I-I promise, I will take you to see him 
 as soon as he's out of surgery. 
 After vision and hearing exams, 
 I'll do a full 
 occupational health screen. 
 And I would do that for 
 every one of your employees. 
 Hmm. 
 Rest your chin here, please. 
 Cucumber water is a nice touch, too. 
 Never had this test before. 
 You don't wear glasses. 
 Most places wouldn't 
 bother with this test. 
 - Hmm. 
 - Do you see a dot anywhere? 
 Yep, right in the middle. 
 Where's the dot now? 
 Nowhere. 
 Nothing in the upper left corner? 
 No. 
 How about now? Upper right? 
 No. 
 Okay. 
 It seems like you have deficits 
 in your peripheral visual fields. 
 According to this test, 
 you're going blind. 
 It's an optic nerve tumor. 
 A craniotomy could get rid of it all, 
 but it'd stop the blood 
 supply to the optic nerves, 
 and she'd still go blind. 
 An endoscopic endonasal approach 
 would avoid those blood vessels. 
 She'd keep around   % of her vision. 
 I need to do better than   %. 
 Is this about the client, 
 or the big fat contract 
 she might bring to your clinic? 
 Glassman's basically gone. 
 I see a vacuum. I want to fill it. 
 I thought you wanted to be a doctor. 
 Last week, you told me 
 I shouldn't expect you 
 to become more ambitious. 
 The reverse is also true. 
 This could clear the tumor 
 proton beam radiotherapy 
 with a synchrotron accelerator. 
 It's experimental. 
 Never been done on an optic nerve tumor. 
 (CELLPHONE DINGS) 
 Got to go. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 That's the last piece of this kidney. 
 LIM: Hemoglobin's  . 
 I don't like his BP, either. 
 I can't fix this liver lac 
 without risking a major bleed. 
 We're almost out of O-neg. 
 Isolate the vascular pedicle. 
 O-O-Okay. 
 You know, his dad's in the waiting room. 
 Think there might be 
 some unresolved issues. 
 Well, 
 if we can get Brandon through this, 
 maybe they'll make amends. 
 My dad and I set aside 
 a lot of our issues 
 after his cancer diagnosis. 
 Maybe my dad will get 
 cancer and we can bond. 
 You know, other than one letter, 
 I haven't heard from him in five years. 
 What did it say? 
 Don't know. Never opened it. 
 Oh! We need more suction and laps. 
 - Where's it coming from? 
 - There. 
 His vena cava ruptured. 
 Clamp it and pack all four quadrants.

 (LAUGHS) 
 So, how is your newest thing 
 coming along? 
 Our hospital. 
 A few problems in radiology. 
 We're spending too much in the pharmacy. 
 And how well do you know John Colson? 
 Head of Pediatrics? 
 Good doctor, good administrator. Why? 
 He won't sign his Ethicure 
 employment agreement. 
 Don't know if I can afford to lose him, 
 and I don't know if I can afford 
 to keep him for what he's asking. 
 You signed your Ethicure 
 contract without any pushback. 
 What sold you? 
 I'm up for trying new things. 
 How do I get one of 
 those hats in my size? 
 Dr. Park! 
 I knew you'd find me a new heart. 
 Uh, let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
 But first, how do we get ready

 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 When are you gonna stop stalking me?

 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 
 It's his patient satisfaction scores. 
 How bad? 
 Is his job at risk? 
 Well, no. 
 Okay. 
 Because I omitted some of his 
 negative reviews to bring his scores up. 
 You did what? 
 Sorry. 
 There's no way this was Shaun's idea. 
 No. 
 He... He didn't even 
 want me to talk to Salen. 
 Did he agree to this? 
 Does he even know about it? 
 (SIGHS) No. 
 So, instead of telling him, 
 you decided to come see me? 
 When did you get so unethical 
 and condescending? 
 You're infantilizing him. 
 These scores, 
 the way Salen runs the hospital, 
 this could really hurt him. 
 Hurting him any more than 
 you're hurting him right now? 
 I kn... I know. 
 I... 
 So, what do you want me to do? 
 You want me to go back to San Jose 
 and co-sign your crap? 
 - This isn't about me. 
 - It is. 
 - It's about Shaun. 
 - It's about you. 
 It's your fiance.

 How's his intracranial pressure?

 It's even higher than it was 
 before we started surgery. 
 Run an EEG. 
 (MONITOR BEEPS, WARBLES) 
 ASHER: Slow waves. 
 Burst suppression pattern. 
 Minimal activity. 
 He's in a coma. 
 Brandon is in a coma. 
 We're trying to relieve 
 the pressure on his skull 
 to try to help his brain recover. 
 And how long will that take 
 for it to recover? 
 It's... It's hard to say. 
 Um... 
 What's more likely, 
 given the extent of his injuries 
 is that it won't. 
 And he will progress to brain death. 
 I thought about calling him this week. 
 So we could work through some stuff. 
 Yeah, those are... 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 ...tough calls to make. 
 We haven't talked in about two years. 
 Since he dropped out of Annapolis. 
 Instead, he was gonna be a 
 drummer. 
 Your dad must be very proud of you. 
 Uh... 
 He wanted a rabbi. 
 A st-straight rabbi. 
 I failed at both, 
 so he disowned me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I really need to talk to my son again. 
 We're trying everything 
 we can to make that happen. 
 Knock, knock. 
 Did you see the proposal I 
 sent you about Nira's treatment? 
 Yes. 
 Very ambitious. 
 And also quite expensive. 
 If the proton beam 
 radiotherapy is successful, 
 we'd save    % of Nira's vision. 
 We'd definitely win 
 the company's contract. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Reasonable medical decision. 
 Bad business decision. 
 The cost of the equipment and treatment 
 is several hundred thousand dollars more 
 than the value of that contract. 
 You have a perfectly 
 acceptable treatment 
 that's FDA approved, 
 covered by her insurance, 
 and saves her life 
 while preserving   % of her vision. 
 I'm fairly certain that's all you 
 need to secure the contract. 
 Our client deserves to know 
 all of her options. 
 You're her doctor. 
 Do what you think is right. 
 But our deal only stands 
 if you make the clinic profitable. 
 It's gonna fit like 
 a heart-shaped glove. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Let's see how much excess 
 fluid you're lugging around, Ollie. 
 OLLIE: Well? No salt 
 and no soda all week. 
 And did you know the brontosaurus had 
 a    -pound heart? 
 Imagine what that sounds like. 
 Probably like ""ka-boom, ka-boom!"" 
 (LAUGHS) 
 Check this out. 
 It's my new lucky charm. 
 It's a triceratops toe. 
 (SIGHS) 
 It's, uh,    million...

 Is your chest hurting, Ollie? 
 (EXHALES SHARPLY) 
 (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 I need a nurse and the ECMO team, stat! 
 Oh, this doctor in Boston used 
 an external drain to 
 lower pressure in the brain. 
 Never mind. The patient died. 
 Well, maybe we can try 
 to relax brain pressure 
 with a hemicraniectomy. 
 He wouldn't survive that surgery either. 
 Made any progress with your patient? 
 Not yet. 
 H-Have you discussed 
 organ donation with his family? 
 No. 
 In his fragile state, 
 his organs won't last long. 
 Shaun, this is a tragedy 
 no matter how it ends. 
 You are breaking the rules. 
 My patient is getting weaker 
 by the minute. 
 Stop. 
 An organ recipient's doctor 
 is not allowed to communicate 
 with a potential donor's doctor. 
 I am talking to you as a friend. 
 You can't save everyone. 
 If your patient is gone, 
 let me save mine. 
 Go away, or I will report you to UNOS, 
 and you'll lose your 
 transplant privileges. 
 Hey, Shaun. You're late. 
 (SIGHS) Yeah, the plane 
 was late and cramped 
 and devoid of refreshments, 
 and I'm starving. 
 You ready to get some pancakes? 
 I need to fix my neurophysiology test. 
 Okay, well, uh, great. 
 - Can we do it while we eat? 
 - No. 
 I answered this one correctly. 
 - Check my work. 
 - I understand that it's not... 
 - Check my work. 
 - Not a perfect score, but... 
 Check my work, please. Check it. 
 - Question  . 
 - Okay, okay. 
 - (SIGHS) Yeah. 
 - (STAMMERS) 
 It should be A, but, uh, 
 it could also be C. 
 But the internal 
 carotid arteries branch. 
 It is worded a little strangely. 
 I would have gotten it wrong, too. 
 Yes, Professor Fontaine is wrong. 
 You need to tell him that. 
 I'm not gonna tell a professor 
 to rewrite his test question. 
 But he is wrong about how blood flows 
 into the supratentorial brain! 
 So what, Shaun? 
 It's just a test, and I'm starving! 
 You go eat. 
 I'm going to see my professor. 
 Shaun. 
 The internal carotid arteries. 
 I don't see any issues in that area. 
 You wouldn't, if there is 
 a very small dissection 
 hidden by all the swelling 
 and other damage. 
 Stents could increase circulation 
 to his supratentorial brain, 
 which might wake him up! 
 Nira? 
 I found a surgery. 
 It's not only going to remove the tumor 
 from behind your eyes, 
 it will also be able to save... 
 ...  % of your vision. 
 (WEEPING) Oh, thank you. 
 LIM: There it is... a tiny tear in 
 the carotid. Good catch, Dr. Murphy. 
 But there's a clot. 
 The stent could expand the clot, 
 which could k*ll him. 
 SHAUN: Not if we break up the clot 
 with therapeutic heparin. 
 We'd be risking major bleeds 
 in all his organs. 
 If we don't give him heparin, 
 he will end up brain dead. 
 During my residency, 
 we had a woman die on the table. 
 Healthy organs, no contact info. 
 No one was saved that day 
 because we didn't know 
 if she was a donor. 
 ASHER: I thought we weren't 
 supposed to consider 
 organ recipients when treating patients. 
 We're not. 
 Right up until the point where 
 what we're doing is futile. 
 SHAUN: It is not futile. 
 This has a  % chance of helping Brandon. 
 Start the heparin drip. 
 I'm sorry, Val. 
 (SIGHS) 
 My boy spent his entire life 
 in hospitals.

 She's a great pediatrician. 
 I'm not sure what you heard, 
 but I'm not going anywhere. 
 Wait... Uh, thank you. 
 I... Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I heard that you were moving on. 
 No, just renegotiating. 
 I thought... 
 I have to go. 
 Thanks for the muffin. 
 Excuse me. 
 Is this seat taken? 
 Your patient is in multi-organ failure. 
 Yes, w-we are treating him 
 with plasma and platelets to increase... 
 He has clots forming 
 on his heart valves, 
 which means his heart is no 
 longer an option for my patient. 
 Okay, you are not supposed to look at 
 my patient's medical records. 
 It is a violation of policy. 
 I wanted to see if his heart 
 was still an option. 
 Your Hail Mary surgery 
 didn't save your patient, 
 and it just k*lled mine. 
 Professor Fontaine said 
 my answer is wrong. 
 I'm sorry to hear that, Shaun. 
 I'm going to talk to the dean. 
 You need to come with me. 
 You're gonna go over 
 the head of your professor? 
 That might cost you more 
 than two percentage points. 
 He is wrong. 
 Well, he might be. 
 Then, why... 
 I got you something, Shaun. 
 Pick one. 
 Mm, I don't care about these things. 
 Okay, I'll pick one for you. 
 I don't do embroidery. 
 You can learn. 
 It's good practice for your sutures. 
 Sometimes bad things happen, okay? 
 Sometimes even unfair things happen. 
 You know that better than anyone. 
 And sometimes you gotta let them go 
 and focus on the next thing, 
 the next challenge. 
 Are you not coming with me 
 to see the dean? 
 No. 
 You said you would 
 always be there for me, 
 to help me. 
 I am. 
 Go if you need to go. 
 I'll still be right here. 
 (DOOR OPENS) 
 We need to talk to Brandon's father! 
 I think we can save Brandon's heart. 
 We can use an embroidery technique. 
 In the     s, Alexis Carrel 
 perfected vascular suturing 
 using embroidery. 
 If we treat his valves 
 like blood vessels, 
 we might be able to repair them. 
 You can save my son? 
 N-N-No. 
 We can only save his heart. 
 For d-donation. 
 It's time to let go. 
 My son is not dead. 
 Only because of what we're doing to him, 
 but he will be very soon. 
 It is futile. 
 No. 
 I nee... I-I need to talk 
 to my son again. 
 I-I need to tell him... 
 ...s-so much. I... 
 I understand. It's too late. 
 No, it's not. 
 Not for that. 
 Talk to him. 
 Say goodbye. 
 If something needs to be said, 
 it should be said. 
 MORGAN: Here you go. 
 Everything's so blurry. 
 That will improve. 
 But the tumor was more complicated 
 than the imaging showed. 
 We were only able to 
 preserve   % of your vision. 
 I'm so sorry, Nira. 
 Don't apologize. 
 You saved my life. 
 I would be blind or dead if you 
 hadn't found that tumor. It's... 
 I should run some 
 vision tests on you now. 
 I will go get those prepped.

 Remember when I bought you 
 that ham radio? 
 Whenever I was stationed overseas, 
 we would send each other 
 messages in Morse code. 
 You picked that up so quickly... 
 But... (LAUGHS) 
 Then, 
 you sent me that message saying 
 that you wanted to be a rock star. 
 And I, um... 
 I shot it down. 
 Everything you wanted changed. 
 I didn't understand it. I... 
 I didn't know how to help you. 
 I had a path laid out, 
 and you didn't want to follow it. 
 I thought you were rejecting me, s... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 And now I know, 
 you were just becoming your own man.

 People have always tried to 
 accommodate for Shaun's differences. 
 Compensate, overcompensate... 
 I don't need another lecture. 
 - I was one of those people. 
 - Mm. 
 It took me forever to get 
 to where you started. 
 Right, it's so easy for me. 
 It is. 
 You always treated Shaun like a person 
 instead of a problem. 
 You always saw Shaun. 
 Why did you stop doing that? 
 You left. 
 So, what? So you panicked? 
 Yeah. 
 Maybe. 
 I don't... I don't know. It's... 
 We're getting married, 
 and he's not always easy, 
 and I'm pretty much always a screw-up. 
 And... 
 It's just... It's too much. 
 No, it isn't. 
 B-But you've always 
 been there to back me up. 
 You don't need me anymore. 
 You're kind and you're patient. 
 You're resilient as all get-out. 
 You're the right person for Shaun. 
 Shaun's the right person for you. 
 If you can just trust that, 
 you will have the most perfect, 
 imperfect marriage. 
 I kind of feel like 
 hugging you right now. 
 Hey. 
 You don't need me. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 There's something I want you to hear.

 You smell good. 
 You coming? 
 I came to give you this. 
 It's where Brandon's organs went. 
 A secretary who's a single mom of three 
 got his kidney. 
 A truck driver with a vision problem 
 got his corneas. 
 A teenager with 
 a rare autoimmune disorder 
 got his ligaments. 
 And a young boy 
 got Brandon's heart. 
 He loves dinosaurs. 
 Brandon helped all these people? 
 There are    people on that list.

 Yeah, me, too.

 Is there anyone you need me to call? 
 Uh, um, no. My... 
 My boyfriend's out of town. 
 (SEAL POPS) 
 What are you gonna do with that? 
 A subxiphoid pericardiocentesis. 
 An echo-guided one would be better,

 Maybe we should wait for the paramedics.

 His diagnosis is Lewy Body Dementia. 
 Oh. 
 How long has he had the symptoms? 
 It began two years ago. 
 Insomnia, muscle weakness, agitation. 
 Recently, 
 he's started having bouts of confusion. 
 We found an experimental trial 
 that uses deep brain stimulation 
 to slow cognitive deterioration. 
 Would you look at it, 
 see if it's worth it? 
 There are so many more doctors 
 with more experience in 
 this field than I have. 
 Aaron, I... I need somebody 
 who's gonna give me the truth, 
 so we don't waste 
 what time we have left. 
 How many clients have been referred 
 for elective procedures from the clinic? 
 Forty-three. 
 Those satisfied clients 
 will lead to more. 
 And the automated intake 
 screens have cut labor costs by  %. 
 But the nurses don't like it. 
 They think they're next. 
 Handle them right, they'll get over it. 
 If you have specific thoughts on that, 
 I'd love to hear them. 
 Maybe over lunch? 
 Morgan, you excel at 
 striking the right balance 
 between enthusiasm and obsequiousness. 
 Thank you.

 - Instead of lunch, 
 how about you and Alex have

 blunt chest trauma from a car accident.

 Fetal heart rate is normal, 
 no signs of distress. 
 Mother became hemodynamically 
 unstable en route. 
 She needs surgery for internal bleeding. 
 Okay, keep rolling. Keep rolling! 
 DR. GLASSMAN: We're gonna do 
 a couple of tests 
 to get a sense of your cognitive state, 
 and then we're gonna 
 throw you in the MRI, 
 the big donut, very loud, 
 to see if you're right for 
 the deep brain stimulation. 
 Any questions? 
 None. 
 What I know or don't know 
 about the medicine 
 will not change the outcome. 
 A patient who doesn't think 
 they know more than their doctors 
 is rare these days. 
 Implicit social contracts 
 are my field of study. 
 They're the agreements we make daily, 
 often without even realizing. (CHUCKLES) 
 But perhaps that's 
 a conversation for another... 
 Who are you? 
 Why are we here? 
 Sunil? Sunil? 
 Uh... 
 You're right where 
 you're supposed to be. 
 Take a deep breath. 
 Tell me their names. 
 Pavan. 
 Reema. 
 And little Raj. 
 Good. 
 Some spells pass a little 
 more quickly than others. 
 I... I think I'm okay now. 
 Sunil. 
 Hmm? 
 Do you remember why you're here? 
 Because I'm dying. 
 Let's get started with those tests. 
 DR. PARK: Sunil's MRI shows 
 no contraindication 
 to deep brain stimulation. 
 Initial labs look good. 
 He's a great candidate. 
 Is the coat hanging in my 
 closet your ""good"" blazer? 
 It's my only blazer, so, yes. 
 Get it dry-cleaned. 
 For our dinner with Andrews and Salen. 
 As intriguing as that pairing is, 
 dinner's a hard pass. 
 Not an option. 
 But compensation is fair. 
 We can finally binge The Wire. 
 Your first offer doesn't get 
 you off the couch, and... 
 Wait, Andrews and Salen? 
 Game respects game. 
 And sometimes sleeps with it. 
 Tickets for you and Kellan 
 to a UFC fight in Vegas. 
 Still no. 
 But save that thought for his birthday. 
 Salen and Andrews? 
 They may have one soul between them. 
 Any sign of motor weakness? 
 He's gonna have to 
 tolerate the head frame. 
 Here's the cervical spine MRI. 
 We could replicate 
 the DBS trial on site. 
 I'd be happy to coordinate. 
 Oh, that's very kind of you. 
 Are you sure you're gonna have time 
 while you overhaul my clinic 
 into an Ethicure profit center? 
 Oh, and by the way, 
 I'm gonna need my office back. 
 I hope you don't mind. 
 - Parathyroid looks off. 
 - Hmm. 
 DR. REZNICK: Is that an ectopic lesion? 
 He's had a history of renal stones. 
 I don't... 
 What were his calcium and PTH levels? 
 They were only mildly elevated. 
 Nothing that triggered for the workup. 
 What are you thinking? 
 I'm thinking this may not be 
 Lewy Body Dementia. 
 SHAUN: Repairing the 
 ventricular tear with Prolene sutures 
 JORDAN: No remaining 
 arterial or major bleeds. 
 Good. I'd prefer not to 
 have to open her belly. 
 I would like both of you 
 to wear socks to my wedding. 
 No shoes. Just socks. 
 Lea and I found a nearly perfect church, 
 but the floor squeaks. 
 Should make for 
 some interesting pictures. 
 JORDAN: No. 
 No way you are robbing me 
 of a chance to show off 
 my new Bruno Maglis. 
 Also, wet and stinky feet are 
 not in Lea's dream wedding. 
 That's... probably true. 
 Last suture is in. 
 Dr. Allen, how's the baby? 
 Heart rate is stable. 
 Okay. Next step, 
 get her down to imaging. 
 We need a surgical plan for 
 these pelvic fractures 
 before they cause any more bleeding. 
 Aaron! Aaron! 
 I didn't expect a miracle, 
 but thank you. 
 He's not out of the woods yet. 
 He still has a lesion. 
 Okay, hopefully benign, 
 hopefully removable.

 Most people stop listening 
 after they hear the very bad news, 
 or, in this case, the very good news. 
 Okay, the nuclear study 
 this afternoon, I got it. 
 What happened with Debbie? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Why did my impulsive, whirlwind marriage 
 to a g*n-toting barista not work out? 
 Hmm. 
 - You're hurt. 
 - Do I look hurt? 
 I just saved a man. 
 I know how you hold onto things. 
 And I know how you try to fix things 
 and you try to fix everyone. 
 - I'm okay. 
 - Talk to me. 
 'Cause I doubt very much 
 you're talking to anybody else. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I was myself, and up close and personal, 
 Debbie didn't like what she saw. 
 She... 
 She said I was controlling and selfish. 
 Did you tell her she was right? 
 Well, yeah, 'cause she was. 
 It didn't help. 
 What's in Montana? 
 Pine trees and cowboy boots and 
 change for me. 
 In Montana, no one knows me, 
 and I have no history, 
 and no one has any expectations of me. 
 You've done this before. After Maddie. 
 That's not fair. 
 I know. 
 But my therapist would say you're 
 ""pulling a geographic."" 
 Has your therapist met me? 
 I have to go prepare 
 for Sunil's procedure. 
 The safest path is external fixation. 
 We'd use a metal frame to 
 stabilize the fractured bones 
 until your baby 
 is ready to be delivered. 
 You'd need three weeks of bed rest, 
 and you'll likely develop 
 debilitating arthritis. 
 There's a significant chance 
 you will never 
 have full mobility ever again, bu... 
 I have grad school. A job. This baby. 
 - That can't be the only option. 
 - No, it's not. 
 I was going to tell you, 
 if we do a C-section now, 
 we could do an internal fixation, 
 which would greatly improve your chances 
 of walking without assistance. 
 Though it does increase 
 the risk of complications 
 associated with premature birth. 
 So I either never walk right again, 
 or I jeopardize my baby's life? 
 Yes. 
 You have to decide. 
 My boyfriend, 
 at first, he didn't 
 want to keep our girl. 
 But then he came around to it. 
 We said that we'd figure it outogether. 
 Then he signs up for 
 this month-long research trip 
 off the Gulf of Alaska, and here I am. 
 I can't choose between 
 myself or my baby. 
 No, you have to choose. 
 I can't. 
 Dr. Glassman, I'm glad you're back. 
 Lea and I have a problem. 
 I heard. 
 The floor squeaks. 
 At the church? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Is that it? 
 No. I also have a patient who 
 won't decide on a surgical plan. 
 Have you talked to Lea? 
 She is no doctor. 
 No, I don't mean about the patient. 
 (SIGHS) Shaun, I am not gonna be around. 
 I'm... I'm moving. 
 I'm selling my house, and I'm moving... 
 (CHUCKLES) 
 ...to Montana. 
 Oh. 
 Will you still be my best man? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Then you should give me your advice. 
 Shaun, you don't need my advice. 
 Sometimes I do. 
 You don't like to give it to me anymore. 
 Lea and you are partners now. 
 You can... You can talk to her, 
 and Lea has a whole lot of 
 stuff she's gotta talk to you about. 
 And you'll work it out, without me. 
 (MACHINE WHIRS) 
 Sharks tickets. 
 Doesn't being together mean that 
 we have an unspoken agreement 
 that when I need a date, you're it? 
 No. 
 (COMPUTER WARBLES) 
 The lesion has an irregular shape, 
 and it's extending into 
 the carotid sheath. 
 It's a malignant carcinoma, 
 and it's invasive. 
 Hey, I thought you were working late. 
 I am going back, but first, 
 you and I need to make a decision 
 about the church and the squeaky floor 
 and something else entirely. 
 Dr. Glassman said you have 
 things you need to tell me. 
 Uh, I didn't go on a business 
 trip a couple weeks ago. 
 I went to Montana to find Glassman 
 and convince him to come home. 
 Because I was really worried about you. 
 What were you worried about? 
 There have been so many 
 changes at the hospital, 
 and I know that's been hard for... 
 - Not because of my... 
 - I know. 
 Not because of your ASD, but because 
 change is hard. 
 And then your patient reviews, 
 and I knew you were 
 struggling with them. 
 I was, but then I improved 
 my interaction techniques, 
 and my scores went up. 
 (SIGHS) 
 That's not what happened, Shaun. 
 I omitted some of the patient reviews. 
 Just the ones where 
 people said really mean stuff. 
 That's why your scores went up. 
 I told you I didn't want you to. 
 I know. I'm so sorry. 
 I just got so worried, 
 and I wanted to protect you. 
 And I thought, if I could 
 just help you, I... 
 What you did was very wrong. 
 I know. 
 I am truly so sorry. 
 No. 
 Your apology is not accepted. 
 (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) 
 The lesion in your neck is cancerous, 
 and it has grown very quickly. 
 I am suggesting a non-surgical approach, 
 one with targeted therapies 
 and radiation. 
 It should give you a few more good years 
 before debilitating symptoms set in. 
 I'm very sorry. 
 There's no way of removing it? 
 It's attached to the carotid artery. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Um... 
 Thank you, Aaron. 
 That's more than we hoped for 
 when we came to you. 
 I was here all night with Dr. Allen. 
 We have not come up with 
 a better surgical solution. 
 Your choices from yesterday 
 remain the same. 
 How is she? 
 Normal fetal movement. 
 Heart rate is    . 
 That's good. 
 Mm. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 I talked to Matt. 
 He's making his way back, 
 but it'll be a couple of days. 
 He says whatever I decide to do, 
 he will support it. 
 Which isn't really helpful right now. 
 No, it's not. 
 You need to make a decision. 
 (SIGHS) 
 He shouldn't have gone, 
 but we needed the money, 
 and it was a great opportunity. 
 But mostly, I feel like it was 
 a reason for him to be somewhere else. 
 He says one thing but 
 does something different. 
 How do you know if he loves you? 
 He does. 
 But someone can love you 
 and still let you down. 
 That doesn't seem right. 
 No. 
 No, it doesn't. 
 Knowing what to expect 
 of others is difficult. 
 People can be very unreliable. 
 That's why I always 
 wanted to be a doctor. 
 Science and biology and 
 medicine are very reliable. 
 I like that. 
 She's relying on me. 
 (SIGHS) 
 I need to do what's best for my baby. 
 Go ahead with the external fixation. 
 How would you rate the new 
 self-serve, self-pay system? 
 Four stars. 
 Not five? 
 I prefer to be stingy 
 with my top rating. 
 (QUIETLY) Last night was a five. 
 So it was even better than 
 a convenient way to buy a smoothie? 
 Hey, what are you doing Thursday night? 
 I invited Morgan and Alex 
 to have dinner with us. 
 A double date? 
 I didn't realize we were going public. 
 We're both consenting adults. 
 What's to hide? 
 As the boss, you are free 
 to do what you like. 
 As a partner, 
 that's not the way it works. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I should have asked you 
 before I told anyone. 
 Marcus, you're smart and funny 
 and almost too good-looking, 
 and your socks don't just 
 match your sweaters, 
 - they elevate your whole aesthetic. 
 - (CHUCKLES) 
 And I told Morgan because 
 I'm excited about you. 
 About us. 
 (WHISPERING) I'll make the reservation. 
 There's a surgical solution 
 here, isn't there? 
 No, no, no. Not a safe one. 
 But you've built your career 
 on doing surgeries 
 that most doctors think 
 are too dangerous. 
 Yeah, because, to quote you, 
 I am an insufferable egomaniac. 
 But that's who we came to see, 
 and now I'm getting some surgeon 
 who's gonna run off to Montana 
 in the guise of becoming 
 a decent human being? 
 Okay, uh, criticize me, 
 yell at me if you like. 
 - I understand you're upset. 
 - All those late nights 
 where you were tackling 
 the most impossible cases, 
 exhausting every possible angle. 
 You come alive in surgery, 
 more than you did in... 
 There are other surgeons. 
 There are other hospitals. 
 I have done everything I know 
 how to do to help you and Sunil. 
 I am sorry if that's not enough. 
 I think you're scared. 
 Of what? 
 Failing. 
 Of failing me again. 
 Yeah, I wish that were true. 
 (CELLPHONE CHIMES) 
 (SIGHS) It's Sunil. 
 I need to get out of here. (PANTING) 
 Don't you see what's happening?

 No, it didn't. 
 The algorithm ignored

 No, it should be the same for everyone. 
 The data has to be corrected. 
 I can't, Shaun. I'm sorry. 
 Then you need to tell Salen. 
 That's a terrible idea. 
 There is no other option. 
 Shaun, I could lose my job. 
 You broke the rules. 
 Maybe you should get fired.

 I could barely look at

 without being reminded 
 about how angry I was, 
 and how angry I was at you

 Shaun wasn't meant to replace Maddie.

 with multiple abscesses. 
 Gluteal fat grafting's not 
 as easy as it looks. 
 Not something you want to 
 try to save a few bucks on. 
 She didn't go to Brazil to save money. 
 She went to prevent being mocked 
 and judged by her own friends. 
 She didn't need to go at all. 
 There's nothing wrong 
 with her belly or her butt. 
 Well, there's nothing ""wrong"" 
 with your hair, either, 
 but you spend oodles 
 of time and money on it. 
 You're hilarious and spend just as much 
 on your skincare and manscaping. 
 This is fun. I wish I had some popcorn. 
 As it is, it's a waste of time 
 our patient doesn't have. 
 Get CTs with contrast to gauge 
 the size and depth of the abscesses, 
 then schedule her for surgery 
 to incise and drain. 
 On it. 
 My skin looks good, though, right?

 Could you do me a favor? 
 I need all the documents

 Whatever your real

 I'm Salen Morrison, the CEO of Ethicure. 
 I just wanted to personally

 I don't have children. 
 I can't even begin to

 (SIGHS) I probably

 My head of legal is gonna freak, 
 but I don't care. 
 You deserve to know. 
 Dr. Lim and Dr. Murphy 
 were both truly heroic 
 in their attempts 
 to save your baby's life. 
 But there was an error made 
 by one of our pharmacists, 
 which caused Dr. Murphy 
 to briefly administer 
 an expired medication. 
 He quickly realized and 
 corrected the mistake, 
 and it's unlikely it had any effect, 
 but it was a mistake, 
 which we take full responsibility for. 
 The pharmacist feels horrible. 
 He's already resigned. 
 Oh, my God. 
 (SIGHS) Ethicure will cover 
 all of your medical expenses, 
 provide counseling for you or for anyone

 And I've authorized an

 I'm... I'm not sure what to say.

 I just need you to sign

 So our accounting department 
 can issue the payment.

 If anybody should be fired here, 
 it should be you. 
 I warned you. 
 I told you that something 
 like this would happen 
 if you went ahead with the changes. 
 Hmm. 
 That's not how I remember it. 
 You do realize that I have notes 
 from every meeting we ever had, 
 copies of every e-mail? 
 What I realize is you've 
 never sued anyone before, 
 while I've sued and been 
 sued by my co-founders, banks, 
 billionaires, and the guy who 
 used to prune my rose bushes. 
 Which is why I have 
 multiple lawyers on retainer. 
 So if I were you, 
 I'd stop threatening 
 and start negotiating.

 I deserve it.

 Mmm? 
 Oh. 
 I was distracted. 
 You're right. 
 We'll need to do two surgeries... 
 A prophylactic fasciotomy 
 and then stabilize 
 the tib/fib fractures. 
 Whatever you think is best. 
 (SIGHS) 
 - You want to talk? 
 - Mmm, I already said... 
 I mean about what happened 
 last night in the pharmacy. 
 No.

 seen him like this before. 
 It's like I'm suddenly a 
 totally different person to him. 
 Yeah, give him some time. 
 Have you talked to him? 
 Yeah. 
 And what did he say? 
 I don't know. He... 
 He's Shaun, you know? 
 What's he gonna say? 
 Sometimes men need 
 more time to get over stuff. 
 Okay, that is both sexist and wrong. 
 He's totally cut me out. 
 He refuses to talk to me at all. 
 (SIGHS) Well, he's stressed. 
 You know, he's retreating into medicine. 
 You're using that as a metaphor, 
 but he literally ran away from me 
 in the cafeteria this morning. 
 Okay, I'll talk to him. 
 Thank you. 
 Excuse me? 
 You're Phil Hall's doctors, right? 
 Yes. 
 Apparently only family can see him, 
 but the nurses said that if I 
 talked to you, that maybe... 
 Are you the woman who told 
 him she just wanted to be friends? 
 - He told you that? 
 - Yes. 
 That's why he got so drunk 
 and crashed his car into a tree. 
 Oh, my God. 
 Could you at least 
 tell him that I'm here 
 and that I care about him and 
 that I hope he's gonna be okay? 
 We can tell him. 
 But it won't make him feel any better. 
 We'll tell him. 
 The abscesses are huge. 
 And multiloculated. 
 The surgeon probably 
 tried to inject too much fat. 
 There doesn't appear 
 to be any intra-abdominal 
 or pelvic involvement yet. 
 She should've hid from her friends 
 in Beverly Hills, not Brazil. 
 Or just learned to love 
 the body God gave her. 
 You two really have such strong 
 beliefs about aesthetic surgery 
 or do you just get off 
 on arguing with each other? 
 He doesn't believe strongly in anything. 
 Just likes to provoke me. 
 I just want to get you 
 to open your mind a little. 
 You know, not be so judgmental. 
 (LAUGHS) 
 I'm the judgmental one? 
 Mr. ""I never date a guy

 You see the woman in the waiting area? 
 That's who he was

 - Mm, bit out of his league. 
 - Yeah. 
 You don't think a woman like her 
 could ever fall in love 
 with a guy like him? 
 Eh, it's possible, 
 if he was rich or a rock star. 
 So you think all women 
 are greedy and shallow? 
 Humans are greedy and shallow, 
 and it's silly to pretend we're not 
 just because it's nicer to 
 talk about the world that way. 
 Saline's clear. 
 No bleeding, no sign of muscle necrosis. 
 Good job. 
 Dr. Lim, you got a page 
 from Lea Dilallo. 
 Tell her I'm on my way. 
 Place the ex-fix to stabilize

 We can do a more

 Murphy can take lead on that. 
 Murphy, you hear me? 
 Yes.

 - It was actually incredibly slow. 
 I had to route the 
 downloads through a proxy 
 and print at different nurses' 
 stations to stay untraceable. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Hold on. 
 These too. 
 You said you wanted everything. 
 It came out to over  ,    pages. 
 (SIGHS) Damn it. 
 What exactly are you looking for? 
 I'm not sure. 
 (SIGHS) 
 Looks complicated. 
 He has a severe comminuted fracture 
 with significant bone loss. 
 The standard ex-fix 
 puts him at high risk 
 for deformity and malunion. 
 Hey, Shaun, I... 
 I know you know that I'm on your side, 
 no matter what. 
 But for whatever it's worth, 
 I think you and Lea 
 make a very good couple. 
 No, I don't want to talk about Lea. 
 Why? 
 Why? 
 Dr. Park says women are shallow. 
 He said that about Lea? 
 She's never dated anyone like me before. 
 Okay, Shaun, 
 Lea might be flaky and impulsive, 
 but, my God, she's not shallow. 
 She made a mistake, Shaun. 
 Give her a break. 
 I have to go. 
 DR. REZNICK: Some of the 
 injected fat got into your bloodstream 
 and embolized to your lungs. 
 We can treat them with medication. 
 But blood thinners will make the surgery 
 on the abscesses too risky. 
 We need to delay repairing 
 the aesthetic surgery 
 until after we fix 
 the clots in your lungs. 
 How long will that take? 
 At least a few days. 
 And even with broad 
 spectrum antibiotics, 
 the infection could spread 
 and damage your glute muscles. 
 Possibly even cause necrosis. 
 You mean like dying flesh? 
 We'll do everything we can to... 
 No way. I... 
 I don't care how risky it is. 
 I want my butt fixed first. 
 If we don't reduce the clot 
 burden to your lungs immediately, 
 the complications 
 could be life-threatening. 
 You said you could do them both. 
 You want to risk your life to 
 avoid an injury to your butt? 
 Yes. 
 I already took a huge risk. 
 I traveled halfway around 
 the world to fix the way I look, 
 and there is no way I'm 
 gonna go backwards now. 
 But what Dr. Reznick is recommending 
 isn't going backward. 
 It's making the best 
 out of an awful situation. 
 You said you wouldn't judge me. 
 I told you what I want. 
 Are you gonna help me or not? 
 Yes. 
 Aspirate the superficial collection, 
 start blood thinners, and schedule her 
 for a surgery first 
 thing in the morning. 
 Your friend's first surgery went well, 
 but he needs to stay under observation 
 until we finish stabilizing 
 his leg fractures. 
 Can I see him? 
 No. But Dr. Park told him 
 what you'd said. 
 Thank you. I'll come back tomorrow. 
 Why could you never be 
 more than just friends with him? 
 Um... 
 Phil is a really great guy. 
 I do love him. 
 I even tried for a while. 
 I thought I could get past it, 
 that I was being shallow. 
 But it's how I feel. 
 I shouldn't just settle. 
 This is... 
 (SIGHS) 
 DR. LIM: She doesn't own the place. 
 At least not yet. 
 By law, the State Attorney General 
 has to approve the change 
 from non-profit to for-profit status. 
 That hasn't happened, 
 which means the deal's not closed. 
 That doesn't make any sense. 
 She's been running the place for months. 
 These acquisitions take time. 
 The buyer has to take control 
 before the regulatory 
 requirements are finalized. 
 And one requirement is, 
 ""For-profit status 
 ""cannot adversely affect the obligation 
 ""to serve the community interest."" 
 And there's no way 
 the A.G.'s gonna agree 
 that k*lling babies ""serves 
 the community interest."" 
 Okay, but why are you telling me? 
 Because while I know what she did, 
 I don't have written proof. 
 Well, I'm sorry. I, um... 
 I took the severance. 
 Agreed to a non-disclosure. 
 Then give it back and... And tear it up. 
 She fired you for something 
 she forced you to do, 
 made you the scapegoat 
 for everything she's done 
 and will continue to do 
 if you don't stop her. 
 If we don't stop her. 
 I have a wife and two kids. 
 I... I need to know 
 that I can get another job. 
 And what about sleeping at night? 
 Don't act like you've 
 never made a compromise, 
 done something at work 
 that you thought was wrong. 
 We all make compromises. 
 But I know you believe 
 this is a lot more than that 
 because you're a decent man, 
 a father trying to do right by his kids. 
 But what happens when they 
 ask you why you changed jobs? 
 Will you tell the truth, 
 or will you look your kids 
 in the eye and lie? 
 (SIGHS) 
 Okay. 
 What do you need? 
 You think Morgan's right? 
 That we constantly argue 
 because we like it? 
 No. It's part of the job. 
 We have to kick the tires on every idea. 
 But we don't have to kick each other. 
 We? 
 You're the one who said my 
 skin looked like the Crypt Keeper's. 
 I was obviously joking. 
 You were obviously annoyed 
 because I expressed an opinion. 
 My problem is not you 
 expressing your opinion. 
 It's that you attribute all 
 of mine to a personal flaw. 
 Maybe growing up where you did, 
 you weren't exposed to 
 a lot of strong women. 
 (WATER RUNS) 
 And maybe growing up where you did, 
 it's common to insult people's mothers. 
 I didn't say anything about your mother. 
 Have you ever even met a Hasidic woman? 
 Is there a problem? 
 - No. 
 - No. 
 Then why are you still 
 in here and not in the OR 
 getting our patient 
 positioned for surgery? 
 - Sorry. 
 - On it. 
 I can't stop thinking 
 about what Monica said. 
 Who's Monica? 
 Lea thinks I'm not good 
 enough to be her husband. 
 Is that the issue? 
 Because that's ridiculous. 
 No, it's not ridiculous. 
 She told me before 
 that we could never be 
 more than just friends 
 because of my ASD. 
 And now she knows she was wrong, right? 
 No. 
 She saw me save a patient 
 from a collapsed building, 
 which shouldn't have 
 made her realize anything 
 because she already 
 knew I was a good doctor 
 - who could save patients. 
 - Shaun... 
 And she wanted you to 
 come back from Montana 
 so she wouldn't be 
 burdened with me on her own, 
 and she changed my 
 client satisfaction scores 
 because she thinks 
 I can't succeed by myself. 
 - That's not quite true. 
 - Yes, it is. 
 - Okay. 
 - I don't want to be married 
 to someone who is just settling for me, 
 especially because 
 all her other boyfriends 
 were just drummers and jerks and... 
 Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! 
 Sit down. 
 - Shaun, sit down. 
 - Okay. 
 Lea is not settling. 
 You're... You're hardworking and honest 
 and loyal and brilliant, 
 and she's lucky to have you, 
 and she damn well knows it. 
 Shaun, 
 sometimes when people love us, they... 
 They want to help, 
 and they help at the wrong time 
 and for the wrong reasons 
 in the wrong way. 
 But Lea loves you. 
 She loves you. 
 (PHONE VIBRATING) 
 Okay. I have to go. 
 Okay, for your surgery, 
 we'll be inserting screws 
 and a series of circular 
 rings with connecting rods... 
 Is Monica still here? 
 No, she went home last night. 
 Connecting rods between... 
 She waited all day, 
 obviously cares about you. 
 That's just pity. 
 Which makes me feel like 
 an even bigger loser. 
 Stop it. 
 You did something irresponsible, 
 - but you're not a loser. 
 - You wouldn't understand. 
 You're good-looking, muscular. 
 I'm sure you were always 
 a great athlete. 
 If she's that superficial, 
 would you have fallen for her? 
 Maybe she's afraid of committing. 
 If you back off, let things develop, 
 maybe she'll change her mind. 
 You really think so? 
 It can't hurt to try. 
 She won't change her mind. 
 And you don't think she ever will. 
 He said there's no way a 
 woman who looked like her 
 would ever love a guy 
 who looked like you. 
 Connecting rods 
 between each circular ring. 
 What the hell are you doing? 
 You... You were lying to him. 
 No, I was trying to cheer him up, 
 which is not only nice 
 but medically beneficial. 
 Look, I understand you're 
 going through some stuff, 
 but if you're not able 
 to get your head straight 
 and focus on the job, 
 you need to let someone 
 else do this surgery. 
 I can focus fine. 
 I did it. 
 Found exactly what 
 we need to get rid of her. 
 You found $   million? 
 We don't need to buy her out, 
 because she hasn't bought us. 
 Not yet. 
 And once the A.G. gets the information 
 I convinced Fremes to turn over, 
 - she never will. 
 - Fremes the pharmacist? 
 He signed an N.D.A. 
 He... He took a check. 
 Which he regrets. 
 He's willing to pass up the 
 money and come forward. 
 Well, that's very heroic of him, 
 but it's irrelevant. 
 The A.G. isn't gonna blow up this deal. 
 We have proof that she 
 was warned her policies 
 would endanger patients, 
 but she forced them through anyway. 
 Let me get this straight. 
 You're gonna rely on someone 
 who's already signed an N.D.A., 
 who's taken money, 
 not to mention that Salen 
 has top-dollar lawyers and 
 lobbyists who are gonna argue 
 that the baby didn't die 
 from expired meds 
 but from a car crash 
 and premature delivery 
 and a pre-existing cardiac condition. 
 Look, I... I... (SIGHS) 
 I agree with you that Salen 
 should not be running a hospital. 
 But there isn't an A.G. 
 in America who would take this on. 
 Unless it comes from you. 
 (SCOFFS) 
 Fine. 
 We'll go in on our own. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING) 
 DR. ANDREWS: Bleeding's 
 not as bad as I'd feared. 
 We need great hemostasis 
 so there's no unsightly 
 fluid collections. 
 Definitely don't want that. 
 No, we definitely don't. 
 This isn't the first time you 
 let your personal feelings 
 about aesthetic surgery 
 impact patient care. 
 Patients have a right to 
 make their own decisions, 
 but they also deserve my honest opinion 
 of the risks and benefits. 
 Honest and professional. 
 Which means based on the medicine, 
 not your personal bias. 
 Patients deserve to benefit from 
 their surgeon's life experience. 
 And clearly felt comfortable 
 enough to make her own decision. 
 He's right. They make a good team. 
 (MONITOR ALARM BEEPING) 
 She's hemodynamically unstable. 
 End-tidal CO  plummeting. 
 Did we cause a venous air embolism? 
 No, it's not air. 
 She's thrown more pulmonary clots. 
 We need mechanical thrombectomy, STAT. 
 Adding an additional Schanz screw. 
 Dr. Park, can you add more traction 
 to facilitate fracture reduction? 
 How's that? 
 Perfect. 
 Dr. Lim, you've got a call. 
 I'm a little busy. 
 It's Dr. Fremes. 
 He says it's urgent. 
 The meeting's already set. 
 No, I... I understand 
 that she's worried, 
 but your kids need a father 
 they can look up to, 
 someone they can be proud of. 
 No. No, no. It can't just be my word. 
 I need your... 
 (SIGHS) Spineless prick. 
 (MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY) 
 Her pressure's dropping. 
 Increase vasopressors 
 and limit fluid overloading. 
 These damn fat clots are harder 
 to aspirate than a blood clot. 
 Can you use a stent retriever? 
 No, it's better to just go with a 
 larger bore aspiration catheter. 
 - Should we stop what we're... 
 - No, keep going. 
 No reason to back up now. 
 Got it. 
 Come on. 
 Hold on. 
 Hold on. 
 (BEEPING SLOWS) 
 Got you, you little bastard. 
 - (MONITOR ALARM BLARING) 
 - She's crashing! 
 Gotta be more in her heart. 
 Let's run an echo, optimize pressers 
 for her cardiac parameters, 
 and prep her femoral for cerebral angio. 
 The surgery was a success. 
 Dr. Lim let Dr. Park and I 
 do it almost all on our own. 
 You want to go out and 
 have a drink tonight? 
 Do you really think Lea realized 
 she was wrong about my ASD? 
 Were you just lying to cheer me up? 
 - Have I ever lied before? 
 - Oh, yes. 
 Okay. I'm not lying. 
 Mmm. 
 Okay. I used to let Robin 
 Johnson copy off my test. 
 She'd tell me how cute I was. 
 But Michelle Plasse told me 
 Robin would make fun of me 
 behind my back. 
 Both seemed nice but 
 one of them was lying. 
 Shaun, you're not a kid anymore. 
 But I'm still weird. 
 Yes, you're weird. 
 I'm weird. Everyone's weird. 
 Everyone feels weird at some point. 
 Everyone feels ugly or 
 stupid or old or whatever it is. 
 That doesn't help at all. 
 I know. 
 What's wrong? 
 If you can still speak 
 and see us... Nothing. 
 You had us very worried. 
 We had to remove 
 multiple clots from your heart 
 and brain during surgery. 
 But now... 
 We were able to debride 
 the gluteal abscesses. 
 We won't know for sure until 
 we see how you heal, but... 
 Doesn't look like there'll 
 be any visible scarring 
 or deformity. 
 Thank you. 
 PLANTE: I don't understand. 
 You told my associates 
 that you and Dr. Fremes 
 had actual evidence. 
 And now not only do you 
 not have any documents, 
 you don't have Dr. Fremes. 
 Because he was intimidated 
 into silence by Salen Morrison. 
 Into silence? 
 Or into taking responsibility 
 for his own actions? 
 I don't understand how 
 a mistake made in an OR 
 or a hospital pharmacy 
 could possibly be the fault 
 of your parent company's CEO. 
 She sidelined our president 
 and began inserting herself 
 into medical decisions. 
 She consistently reduced 
 the quality of care 
 to boost Ethicure's profits. 
 Dr. Lim, I get that these takeovers 
 may involve policy changes 
 that you don't approve of... 
 If she started her own 
 for-profit hospital, 
 she'd have every right to 
 run it however she saw fit. 
 But she didn't do that. 
 She bought ours... Aa non-profit. 
 Which means she's legally obligated 
 to serve the community, 
 the whole community, 
 not just patients 
 with premium insurance. 
 And you have a responsibility 
 to make sure that means something. 
 That it's not just 
 fine print in a contract 
 no one will ever read. 
 I agree. 
 But do you have any 
 actual evidence of fraud 
 or criminal activity 
 done by Salen Morrison? 
 I have a dead baby. 
 And that is Salen Morrison's fault. 
 And I guarantee this is 
 gonna happen again and again 
 if you don't step in and do 
 what only you can do to stop it. 
 Let me think, and I'll get back to you. 
 Thank you. 
 Dr. Murphy did a great job. 
 You've a long road ahead 
 and probably a few more surgeries, 
 but it looks very good. 
 You have no nerve injuries 
 and both bones in your shin 
 have been stabilized 
 with good alignment. 
 Did Monica come back? 
 No. 
 Good. 
 (INHALES SHARPLY) I don't need her pity. 
 And you were right. 
 She obviously wasn't 
 gonna change her mind. 
 Maybe you should change yours. 
 I get the feeling that you 
 also care a bit too much 
 about how your dates look, 
 how they make you look to other people 
 instead of how they make 
 you feel about yourself. 
 Is that your way of telling me 
 that because I'm fat and ugly 
 I should only date 
 women who are the same? 
 I don't think you're fat or ugly. 
 But if you want to find someone 
 who loves you more than just a friend, 
 you need to start loving yourself. 
 Just get out and leave me alone. 
 Let the nurse know if you 
 need more meds for the pain. 
 What're you looking at? 
 I just... I told you, 
 just... Just get out. 
 Dr. Park is right. 
 You should listen to him. 
 ASHER: I can't believe it. 
 We actually saved her lungs, 
 her brain, and her ass. 
 That's a triple play. 
 She's lucky she didn't end 
 up with major organ damage. 
 She was lucky to have us. 
 The way we fight all the time at work? 
 That's how it is with me 
 and my oldest brother. 
 He drives me insane. 
 But I love him. 
 He also thinks a beard 
 makes him look taller. 
 That was unkind and uncalled for. 
 - Or the truth. 
 - (LAUGHS) 
 (BREATHING HEAVILY) 
 Hello? 
 This is she. 
 Thank you. I... I really 
 appreciate your taking the time. 
 No, actually, I don't understand. 
 _ 
 (THUNDER RUMBLES) 
 Good night. How was your meeting? 
 What meeting? 
 Your meeting with the A.G. 
 I've always been open with you, Audrey. 
 Tried to help you understand what it is 
 I'm trying to accomplish here. 
 And you went behind my 
 back and tried to destroy it all. 
 I'm never gonna forget it. 
 I don't want to cancel our wedding. 
 We love each other 
 and are good for each other. 
 And I forgive you for lying 
 about your trip to Montana 
 and changing my scores. 
 I know you were just trying to help me. 
 Thank you. 
 Did you want Dr. Glassman to come back 
 so you wouldn't have to 
 take care of me on your own? 
 I wanted him to come back 
 because he cares about you. 
 And I know that you care about him, too. 
 I don't need you to take care of me. 
 I know. And I don't mean to smother you. 
 I... I just want to help you 
 and be there for you. 
 Do you believe I'm not 
 good enough for you? 
 That you're not good enough? 
 What're you even talking about? 
 You told me once that you could never be 
 in a relationship with me 
 because of my ASD. 
 Is that what you think? 
 It's what you said. 
 Yeah, a long time ago. 
 Are you seriously telling 
 me that you don't see 
 a difference in how I feel about you? 
 That I haven't grown at all? 
 Our relationship hasn't grown? 
 Shaun, all I was trying to do 
 is help someone that I love, 
 to be there for you like 
 you've been there for me. 
 But you just can't seem 
 to see it that way, 
 no matter how many times I've tried. 
 I mean, is every mistake I 
 make going to be something 
 that you hold against me forever? 
 No, I... I am forgiving you. 
 No, I don't need you to forgive me. 
 And I'm done. 
 I'm... 
 I'm done apologizing for helping you 
 and caring about you and 
 whatever else I'm doing 
 that you seem to find so unbearable. 
 Yes. No... No, that's not what I said. 
 No. What you're saying is that 
 I'm not good enough for you. 
 That's actually not true... 
 And if that's what you feel, then fine. 
 Maybe we shouldn't get married. 
 Mmm-hmm. And you know what? 
 Maybe we shouldn't even be 
 living together, 
 so I'm gonna get 
 out of your way. Totally. 
 And you can sleep 
 in your own bed tonight, 
 and first thing tomorrow, 
 I'll start looking 
 for a new place to live.

gdoc_5_9,6470478,5,9,"You have a couch, right? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 Hey, good morning. 
 Salen didn't tell you? 
 She made me Chief of Surgery. 
 Dr. Park, this is Joe. 
 He was helping his son, Cody, into 
 his wheelchair when they had a spill. 
 I'm too big for Dad. 
 No, you're not, buddy. 
 Cody has Kabuki Syndrome. 
 You got banged up, too, huh? 
 I-I'm okay. Just help Dad. 
 You know about Kabuki? 
 Genetic disorder characterized 
 by low muscle tone, 
 heart defects, 
 intellectual impairment... 
 And in Cody's case, 
 chronic hypoglycemia. 
 And Joe has a group three 
 clavicle fracture 
 and shoulder dislocation. 
 Ah, it looks worse than it feels. 
 You're not in pain? 
 Is that a bad thing? 
 Might be a sign of nerve damage. 
 We'll use some plate and screws 
 to stabilize your collarbone. 
 While we're in there, 
 we'll figure out why you're not hurting. 
 Are you gonna be okay? 
 Yeah. I'll be right back, Code. 
 Last few years, 
 it's just been the two of us. 
 But we're a team. 
 Best team ever. 
 Bye, Dad. 
 See you in a bit, buddy. 
 Sorry if I'm a bit nervous. 
 I'm a huge fan. 
 So I still have one? 
 I was    when I first saw 
 the Dunn Sisters live, 
 and I saw your sister's tour 
 last year at the Rose Bowl. 
 Then you've seen her more than I have. 
 She's made it even without 
 my accompaniment. 
 Hey. 
 Your bloodwork confirms good 
 compatibility with the donor tissue, 
 so, Nelly, if you're up for it... 
 I have been for five years. 
 All right. 
 Let's begin prep on all asp... 
 Oh. There's a thrill 
 in her left carotid. 
 Could be arterial obstruction. 
 Without an adequate blood 
 supply to the donor trachea, 
 we can't do the surgery. 
 It's a concern, 
 but not sure it's a problem. 
 Let's do a CTA. 
 You'll be fine. 
 Uh, don't, uh... Don't bother. 
 I'm fired? 
 No. 
 But I expect you'll be moving on. 
 Dr. Novick at San Jose General 
 is looking for a new Head of Trauma. 
 It'll be more money 
 and a chance for a fresh start. 
 He's expecting your call. 
 That's one way to deal with dissent. 
 And by dissent, I mean attempting 
 to hold you accountable 
 for your negligence. 
 I'm sorry you couldn't get 
 on board with my approach. 
 We could have crushed it. 
 I'll text you his number. 
 Giants fan? 
 Churros. 
 Most people call 'em 
 the San Jose Giants, 
 but fans call them the Churros. 
 How many stitches am I gonna get? 
 Looks like six. 
 You've had them before, though, right? 
 Yep, when I was a baby 
 and they fixed my heart. 
 How many is my dad gonna need? 
 A few more than six. 
 But we've got our two 
 best doctors working on him. 
 You know, besides me. 
 How long is Dad's surgery gonna take? 
 He should be out in about two hours. 
 He was a high school principal 
 in charge of     kids. 
 Mm, very cool. 
 But he had to quit to look after me. 
 Will he still be able to lift me? 
 Once his arm's all better? Absolutely. 
 You two will be out there catching 
 foul balls before you know it. 
 You promise? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 All done. 
 What does Lea like for breakfast? 
 Huevos Rancheros con salsa verde. 
 Muy bien, but I'm asking 
 because she's sleeping on my couch. 
 Nelly's internal carotids look good. 
 Hmm, yes. They do look 
 better than they felt. 
 Check the external carotids. 
 So you're not getting married? 
 Yes. 
 Because of something she said 
 over two years ago? 
 Shaun, stop being 
 a relationship archeologist. 
 You're digging up stuff 
 that isn't relevant. 
 Archeologists dig up stuff 
 that is very relevant. 
 And Lea still believes it. 
 She changed my client satisfa... 
 She apologized, Shaun. 
 You're attributing an expired motive 
 to her current actions. 
 How do I know it's expired? 
 Because you trust her, 
 and you love her for who she is, 
 a flawed, messy, 
 and totally wonderful human being. 
 Hmm, the left external carotid 
 is stenotic. 
 I was right. 
 We can't do the surgery. 
 You have to do the surgery. 
 Poor flow from the carotid 
 could lead to graft necrosis, 
 sepsis, and possible death. 
 It's been a minute. 
 You look awful. 
 You look fake. 
 Because of the blood flow issues, 
 the transplant will be riskier 
 than we thought, 
 but I don't believe prohibitively so. 
 It's still a viable option 
 if you feel it's worth the risks. 
 It isn't, okay? 
 Your electrolarynx works fine, 
 and a normal voice 
 is not worth dying for. 
 You don't sing, do you? 
 N-No, but even if 
 the transplant is successful, 
 your new voice may be very different 
 from your original singing voice. 
 I know. 
 I just want a voice. 
 People don't listen to robots. 
 Nelly, we're talking about your life. 
 See? 
 You didn't hear me. 
 I want the surgery. 
 Okay. 
 Nerve signaling is disrupted. 
 That's why Joe wasn't feeling any pain. 
 Evaluating the brachial plexus. 
 Just a heads-up, 
 you may be getting a call 
 for a reference. 
 You're leaving St. Bon's? 
 More like fleeing Salen Morrison. 
 Demoting you is an insult to all of us. 
 I found the culprit. 
 Bone splinter compressing the plexus. 
 Well, thanks for that. 
 I'm sure Andrews will do a fine job. 
 If he's not Salen's puppet. 
 Good news is, no nerve laceration. 
 I have an interview to run 
 trauma over at SJ General. 
 That was fast. 
 They need any surgical residents? 
 Or anesthesiologists? 
 Nerve signaling isn't improving. 
 It's an ossified ligament 
 compressing the cervical cord. 
 His arm's permanently paralyzed. 
 The ossified ligament has 
 probably developed over years. 
 It's why you weren't feeling any pain. 
 Your fall drove it 
 into your cervical cord. 
 Can't you remove it? 
 It's adhered to the dura 
 encasing your spinal cord. 
 The surgery to remove it could 
 leave you paralyzed in multiple limbs. 
 I can't take care of Cody with one arm. 
 You know, if I don't have this surgery, 
 there's a    % chance that 
 my son will be institutionalized. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But I strongly recommend against it. 
 I agree with Dr. Park. 
 But only you know 
 what's best for your family. 
 I need to do this. 
 We're starting you 
 on immunosuppressive therapy. 
 You may feel some headaches or nausea. 
 Dr. Allen is a bit of a fangirl. 
 Hey, backstage passes if you 
 can talk some sense into my sister. 
 Dr. Andrews is the best. 
 If he says he can make it work, 
 it'll work. 
 Dr. Murphy doesn't think so. 
 Dr. Andrews is the Chief of Surgery. 
 I'm your big sister. 
 If I had listened to you, 
 I would have ended 
 my career in fishnets. 
 If you'd listened to me, 
 you'd still have a career. 
 Yes. 
 I should have been wearing my seatbelt, 
 especially with you driving. 
 I demonstrated lousy judgment. 
 It's kind of like 
 this whole transplant thing. 
 Ooh, clever new spin. 
 If only your songs were that smart. 
 Okay. 
 You've been at St. 
 Bonaventure for    years, 
 went from resident to Chief. 
 Makes for a pretty boring resume. 
 It shows dedication 
 and a loyal following. 
 But it does beg the question, 
 why now? 
 Um... 
 St. Bon's has changed a lot. 
 Well, Salen and Ethicure will do that. 
 But still, man, 
 it's tough to leave home. 
 Yeah. 
 St. Bon's made me 
 the doctor I am, but... 
 I don't know if it's home anymore. 
 Hmm. Well, it's their loss. 
 You'd be overseeing the 
 busiest Level   trauma center 
 in the Bay Area. 
 The wall is too stiff. 
 Too stiff. 
 I can't maintain lumen patency. 
 And that's why we're practicing. 
 You practice because 
 something is difficult, 
 not because it's impossible. 
 Ugh, okay, obstruct it again 
 for the eighth time. 
 We should not attempt this. 
 This is an innovative surgery, Shaun. 
 The exact kind of case that 
 usually makes you very excited. 
 Instead, it's made you very... contrary. 
 That might be because 
 there's a certain someone 
 crashing on my couch. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh, she means Lea. 
 Oh, I know. 
 This is not about Lea, okay? 
 This is about a bad surgery. 
 It's a risky surgery, Shaun, 
 but one that can drastically improve 
 the quality of this young woman's life, 
 and not just physically, 
 but emotionally and psychologically. 
 We need to be aware of how 
 our own personal dynamics 
 might impact our decisions. 
 Oh, you're talking about me and Lea. 
 Again. 
 Yes, I am. 
 You and Salen are dating. 
 Is that dynamic impacting 
 your decision to... 
 Why did you just kick me? 
 I'm very aware of my ""dynamic,"" 
 and, no, it's not affecting 
 my medical decisions. 
 Ninth time's the charm. It's perfusing. 
 This is possible, 
 and it's going to work. 
 Looking good. 
 What's his name? 
 - Sebastian. 
 - Ooh. 
 First time I swiped right in... 
 Three months. 
 Mm. 
 Looks like you got your night planned. 
 Yeah, I thought... 
 We could talk. 
 Tomorrow. 
 My problems are not going anywhere. 
 Give me a beer. 
 No. Go. I-I'll be fine. 
 Mm-mmm, I already broke 
 Sebastian's heart. 
 Beer. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 I never did like the big office. 
 Always made me feel guilty 
 for not reading enough books. 
 A Dr. Novick called me 
 from San Jose General 
 asking me if he could poach you. 
 Six months ago, 
 I would have been pissed. 
 Six months ago, 
 this was a great place to work. 
 Yeah, well, we had a good run. 
 Must be hard not to say ""I told you so."" 
 Excruciating. 
 You did what you had to do. 
 Now you gotta go. 
 Should I? 
 Get out while you can. 
 And let Salen ruin this place? 
 This is my home. 
 I'm gonna fight for it. 
 Hey. 
 Lexi? 
 You want to see your sister? 
 Yes. 
 I don't know. 
 You... You should see her. 
 It may be your last chance. 
 I thought I'd lost her 
 in the car accident. 
 Prayed to just keep her alive, 
 but I really did lose her that night. 
 She was pissed that 
 I'd go on without her, 
 but I-I had to. 
 It was my life. 
 I'm glad you did. 
 Without her music, it's not the same. 
 She's the genius, and without her... 
 You miss her. 
 What really hurts is that she thinks 
 this is what I've always 
 wanted, to be the star. 
 Did she tell you that? 
 She doesn't have to. 
 You should tell her how you feel 
 and trust her to tell you 
 the truth about how she feels. 
 Nelly's crashing. 
 We need epi and a central line, STAT. 
 She's having a reaction to 
 the immunosuppressive therapy. 
 We have to call off the transplant. 
 No, we don't. 
 We find a fix to this problem, 
 and if she still wants 
 the surgery, we'll do it. 
 Dr. Andrews still wants 
 to do the trachea transplant, 
 but I think that's a very bad idea, 
 so I'd rather not help him 
 figure out how to do it. 
 Dr. Andrews thinks I only feel that way 
 because I am upset about Lea. 
 Well, you are upset. 
 Emotions have a way of leaking 
 everywhere sometimes. 
 Okay, how do I know if that's happening? 
 I don't know, Shaun. 
 You just have to focus on, 
 you know, work, I guess. 
 Look, Dr. Andrews is smart, 
 he's experienced, 
 the Chief of the Department. 
 He also happens to be your boss. 
 You're just a resident, so guess what. 
 Tell him what you think 
 and, bang, boss wins. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, I will help him. 
 But our patient will probably die. 
 Pedicle screws. 
 I'm guessing you aced the interview? 
 Yes. 
 And turned the job down. 
 Cervicothoracic rod. 
 Remember The Magnificent Seven? 
 Which version? 
 The metaphor works for either one, 
 or Seven Samurai. 
 Our village is under siege, 
 and I've decided to recruit a 
 ragtag group of freedom fighters 
 willing to stand up to the bad guy. 
 I'm in. 
 If she finds out, she will slaughter us. 
 I'm in. 
 I have four months left of my residency. 
 - I get it. 
 - I've been keeping my head down. 
 That's smart. 
 That's what I told myself. 
 Then she k*lled a baby. 
 I'm in. 
 Yippee-ki-yay. 
 Ossified ligament is isolated. 
 Elevating. 
 It's eroded through the dura. 
 Evoked potentials are dropping. 
 Yeah, it's fused to 
 the spinal cord itself. 
 Dad? Dad? 
 Cody, what's up? 
 Dad shoulda been done 
 with his surgery by now. 
 I said his doctors are good, not fast. 
 They're major slowpokes. 
 I need to see Dad. 
 Hey, Cody, everything is okay. 
 I'm a doctor. 
 I know all about this stuff. 
 - That's what they said! 
 - Who? 
 The doctors! 
 When Mom died! 
 You have to keep calm, Cody. 
 Just nice, gentle breaths. 
 Now? 
 Please? 
 Now! 
 Please! 
 I need oxygen and a crash cart! 
 I can't feel my legs. 
 The ligament was adhered 
 to your spinal cord. 
 There was no way to 
 decompress it without damage. 
 Am I a paraplegic? 
 Yes. 
 There's nothing else? 
 Not at this time, Joe. 
 Where's Cody? 
 In the ICU. 
 He had a panic attack 
 that led to a ruptured aortic aneurysm 
 at the site of his childhood 
 heart surgery. 
 He's recovering now. 
 You took a big, brave risk 
 for your family. 
 Can I see my son now? 
 Monoclonal antibodies 
 could block cytokine signals. 
 Nelly's reaction to 
 the immunosuppressants 
 suggests she'll have an even 
 worse reaction to the antibodies. 
 What if we tried a different 
 grafting technique like... 
 No, no, there is too much 
 scar tissue from the... 
 I... 
 Oh, relax. I'm just an attending now. 
 With a favor to ask. 
 Park already asked me. 
 I really respect you, 
 but I worked my ass off 
 to get into this residency program. 
 I can't risk it. 
 I know you think things were 
 better before Salen took over. 
 - Definitely. 
 - So, you're in? 
 Definitely not. 
 I have too many emotions, and 
 they may already be leaking. 
 I can't even tell. 
 Oh. Oh. 
 Bone marrow. 
 Oh, that was odd. 
 I'm pretty sure she just had an idea. 
 Hmm. 
 You may want to go with her. 
 I have to go. 
 By infusing the donor's bone 
 marrow stem cells into Nelly, 
 we trick her body into thinking 
 the donor trachea is hers. 
 Nice. Although, 
 it does increase the risk of infection, 
 which I assume 
 you're about to point out. 
 No, not now that you've said it. 
 I may be cranky about Lea, 
 but you are definitely my boss, 
 and the boss wins. 
 Run it past Nelly. 
 Hey, Codeman. 
 Dad. 
 What... Why are you in a wheelchair? 
 When they tried to fix my arm, 
 it kind of messed up my legs. 
 Now I get to ride around 
 in this hotrod all day. 
 How you feeling? 
 Tired. When can we go home? 
 Real soon, buddy. 
 But you're gonna have a new home. 
 What? Where are we going? 
 I... 
 I can't come with you. 
 Y-You'd live somewhere else? 
 With both of us in the chairs, 
 it's just... 
 I don't know how we'd manage. 
 There's a great place in San Francisco. 
 Dad, no... 
 No, you'll be way closer to the Giants. 
 And I'll come see you 
 and take you to a game. 
 But we're a team. 
 Always will be, buddy. 
 Cody? 
 Are you seeing double? 
 It happens sometimes. 
 We need to get him an MRI. 
 This could actually be a good thing. 
 Trick my body any way you want. 
 You forget something? 
 I remembered something. 
 Christmas,     . 
 We had two... 
 Big presents under the tree. 
 You opened yours first. 
 I never wanna cause you harm... 
 A Baby Taylor acoustic guitar. 
 I was hoping for a keyboard. 
 But you got a makeup set 
 because you were the pretty one. 
 Because I was the talentless one. 
 I still f-feel like that. 
 You sell out arenas. 
 You write like Joni Mitchell. 
 It would be nice to do it together. 
 She misses her, too. 
 In fourth grade, I always got picked on 
 and beat up in the locker 
 room before gym class. 
 My gym teacher, Mr. Carl, 
 tried to get the other kids to stop. 
 That just made it worse. 
 So he told me if I stopped coming to 
 gym class, he'd give me a B anyway. 
 So I stopped. 
 Okay... 
 I still got bullied, 
 just not in the locker room. 
 All Mr. Carl did was make me 
 feel weak and useless. 
 The same way you felt 
 when I changed your scores. 
 You are a flawed, messy, 
 and totally wonderful human being. 
 You're definitely good enough for me. 
 So are you, Shaun. 
 I promise. 
 I trust you. 
 Thank you. 
 But at some point, 
 you'll feel worried and insecure, 
 or I'll feel messy, 
 and we will fight agai... 
 I don't want to. 
 Neither do I, Shaun. 
 Jordan's couch is not comfortable. 
 But my point is... 
 Next time I feel insecure, 
 I'll ring the cowbell. 
 I think we're gonna need 
 more than the cowbell. 
 We're gonna need a lot of hard work. 
 I like hard work. 
 Me, too. 
 He was sweaty, pale, had visual issues. 
 A pituitary tumor may be causing 
 some of the symptoms we thought 
 were due to his Kabuki Syndrome. 
 This is a fishing expedition. 
 You feel guilty. 
 You gave Joe permission to risk it all, 
 and it didn't work. 
 Now you're desperate to do 
 anything to help this family. 
 And that's a problem? 
 Getting these people's 
 hopes up for a miracle? 
 His pituitary's clear. 
 Let's look at 
 his other endocrine organs. 
 I heard you joined Lim's posse. 
 I live by the credo, 
 people who k*ll babies 
 shouldn't run hospitals. 
 Adrenals are clear. 
 That's reductive. 
 There was a mistake, a big one. 
 No one's denying that. 
 But systemic changes rarely 
 happen without a hitch, 
 and hopefully, in the long run, 
 this will become a better place. 
 Pancreas. 
 Right diagnosis, wrong organ. 
 Dissecting the distal trachea. 
 There's extensive lumen scarring. 
 But we can resect 
 all but the posterior third 
 of the cricoid cartilage to address it. 
 That's right. You seem more agreeable. 
 Lea and I made up. 
 That's great news. 
 Tonight's Sebastian's lucky night. 
 Shall I place the new endotracheal tube? 
 Yes, please, Dr. Murphy. 
 Okay. 
 Let us know when you're 
 ready for O  flow, Dr. Murphy. 
 Have you thought about it? 
 Call Novick back. Take the job. 
 Aaron, please, we need you. 
 This hospital needs you. 
 It's a small tumor on his pancreas, 
 and it's been causing 
 his low blood sugar, 
 chronic fatigue, and muscle weakness. 
 He might be able to walk 
 if we remove it. 
 His doctor said those symptoms 
 were tied to his Kabuki. 
 Well, sometimes, doctors 
 only see the disability. 
 Dr. Reznick saw beyond that. 
 What if we don't remove it? 
 Nothing new. 
 It's benign, slow-growing. 
 No. 
 I took the big swing. 
 I can't do that to Cody. 
 If this works, 
 you could make it together, as a team. 
 Almost there. Release the clamps.

 Ahh, got it.

 Thank you. 
 You had a bleed that would 
 have k*lled most patients. 
 Turns out, 
 you have incredible clotting factors. 
 Thank you for that.

 Try. It won't hurt it.

 Holy crap. 
 Thank you. 
 Our pleasure. 
 So, you... You patched 
 things up with Lea. 
 And the surgery worked out. 
 That's... That's good. 
 It was a failure. 
 Well, the patient survived, 
 and... And she's talking now. 
 That's... That's... That's a good thing. 
 She only lived because 
 of her clotting factors. 
 It had nothing to do with us. 
 So, you caught a break. That's okay. 
 No. 
 No, it isn't. 
 I knew it was a bad surgery, 
 but everyone wanted me 
 to think I was wrong. 
 But you were wrong,

 If you're here to

 so I quit. 
 I'm creating a spreadsheet

 Apologize. Save your career.

 What's she gonna do, 
 drag you out of the hospital

 Well... Can you give me 
 a salve or something? 
 This is... beyond salve. 
 They seem like a cool couple. 
 They seem fine. 
 Torres imaging come through yet? 
 Not yet. 
 Supportive, fun, loving, 
 but not in a gross, performative way. 
 You picked up a lot in two minutes. 
 Sounds like someone wants a boyfriend. 
 I have been considering 
 venturing out of Hookuptown 
 for something more serious, 
 which requires finding 
 someone to get serious about. 
 That does tend to be the hard part. 
 Well, that's why I've decided 
 to raise the bar, 
 only date guys that check all the boxes. 
 So, your plan is to be more 
 open by being more closed? 
 [TABLET CHIMES] 
 The images are in. 
 I want to be more intentional about it, 
 find someone who gets me, 
 but also challenges me. 
 Instead of getting diverted 
 by whoever has the hottest profile pic. 
 Two nodules in the left lung, 
 one in the upper lobe, one lower. 
 That doesn't look like pneumonia. 
 That looks like cancer. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 LEA: Hi. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 So, about this morning, 
 when you came home 
 and caught me, you know... 
 Boosting my own morale... 
 I used to boost my own morale 
 a lot before we got together. 
 But I don't anymore 
 because we usually have 
 very satisfying sex. 
 Yes, we do. 
 Absolutely, we do. 
 Did you need a boost 
 because we haven't had sex in nine days? 
 I didn't know we were counting. 
 Our average is every  .  days. 
 It has been a stressful few months. 
 If you wanted a morale boost, 
 why didn't you want me to do it for you? 
 No, it's... it's not that. 
 I-I just... I don't know. 
 I woke up and had a few minutes 
 and wanted to take the edge off. 
 Is it... the same 
 as when we're together? 
 No. 
 It's... different. 
 It's definitely not as good, 
 but it is... faster. 
 Oh, I can go faster. 
 [CHUCKLING] No, Shaun. 
 Boosting my own morale 
 is not a substitute 
 for being with you, ever. 
 And I did try to get things going 
 a couple times last week, 
 but you were busy. 
 You didn't ring the cowbell. 
 It wasn't cowbell worthy. 
 We agreed if we were off course, 
 we'd ring the cowbell. 
 We are not off course. 
 We're having a dry spell, 
 and it will blow over. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 That is a lot of weather terms. 
 I'm not sure they apply. 
 Yeah. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Anorectal ailments are one of the 
 oldest recorded medical conditions. 
 One early remedy was to 
 burn them off with hot coals. 
 We can remove yours surgically, 
 but we need to do it right away. 
 Isn't there some way we could 
 schedule it for next week? 
 Your hemorrhoids have already ruptured. 
 You're at risk of serious complications. 
 Oh. 
 The surgery is now routine 
 and effective. 
 No hot coals. 
 MORGAN: But the recovery 
 can be quite painful. 
 You'll need a special diet 
 and sitz baths. 
 No exercise or exertion, including sex, 
 for six to eight weeks post-op. 
 No sex? Why? 
 The wounds need time to heal. 
 We can get you on the schedule 
 for later today. 
 The X-rays show two nodules 
 in your left lung, 
 possibly cancerous. 
 We'll know more after the biopsy. 
 It's a simple procedure. 
 Um, the... the biopsy... 
 Is covered under the uninsured program? 
 It all is. 
 And we'll run a few labs 
 and get you started on fluids. 
 Is this arm okay for the IV? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Listen, Mari, 
 I was on the phone with your insurance. 
 What? W-Why? 
 To save you the hassle. 
 - Sorry, I need you to hold still. 
 - Oh. Sorry. 
 You... You shouldn't have called them. 
 Why not? We need to get this sorted out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Mari, whatever is going on, 
 you can tell me. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Um... 
 My insurance didn't lapse. 
 I, uh... I lost it. 
 Because, um... 
 I'm undocumented. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 JORDAN: Brenna? 
 W-Where is our patient? 
 She's not in the bathroom, 
 and her clothes and personal 
 belongings are all gone. 
 Code green. We have a runner. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I checked the whole 
 second floor. No Brenna. 
 She's not in the cafeteria 
 or the lobby or the gift shop. 
 We should check all the exits. 
 Lea and I haven't had sex for nine days. 
 Lenore, the gift-shop cashier, 
 she recommended light bondage. 
 Dr. Park suggested 
 a romantic bubble bath, 
 but Lea and I don't agree 
 on water temperature. 
 You both are busy. 
 Have you tried scheduling it? 
 Reliability is sexy. 
 [WOMAN SCREAMING] 
 I think we found her. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 All right, time for your biopsy. 
 I'll have her back 
 in about an hour or so. 
 I should drop the bags off 
 at the apartment. 
 Isaac, can we please talk about this 
 before I go into my procedure? 
 We've been together two years. 
 I was gonna tell you. 
 When? 
 The wedding? 
 I promised myself that if 
 marriage were ever on the table 
 for real, that I'd tell you, 
 but when you proposed, 
 my DACA renewal had just been rejected. 
 And it really freaked me out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It was, uh... 
 It was all because of a stupid 
 marijuana DUI on my record. 
 Another thing you've been hiding. 
 It was years ago. 
 Cops pulled me over for a tail light. 
 They searched and they found edibles, 
 and they arrested me for driving high, 
 which I wasn't. 
 [COUGHING] 
 Okay, let's get her 
 some humidified oxygen. 
 [COUGHING CONTINUES] 
 I was... [COUGHS] 
 I was trying to get it expunged. 
 Breathe into this. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 I'm gonna go. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [GASPING] 
 [COUGHING] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I can get rid of that for you. 
 There's blood in her sputum. 
 You're bleeding 
 from your lungs and airway. 
 Let's get to the O.R., stat. 
 [COUGHING] 
 BRENNA: I'm sorry I ran. 
 I know I need surgery. 
 JORDAN: You're scared. I understand. 
 No, it's not just that. I have this date 
 that I've been waiting 
 a really long time for. 
 And a rain check poses a problem? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I am... 
 A virgin. 
 I am    years old 
 and I have never had sex. 
 [LAUGHS, SIGHS] 
 Because of your religion? 
 Honestly, I don't know. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I mean, freshman year in college, 
 I-I made this really detailed list 
 of what I wanted in a boyfriend, 
 and then I fell madly in love 
 with my work. 
 For a while, I thought 
 I wasn't having sex 
 because I was obsessed with Jane Austen. 
 It's commonly believed that 
 she was a virgin when she died. 
 She was obsessed with her work, too. 
 I n... I never stopped looking. 
 But every year that I waited, 
 it just got harder 
 to imagine telling someone 
 I'd met a couple times 
 over coffee or drinks 
 that I... had never had sex. 
 I just... 
 I just felt so ashamed. 
 You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 [LAUGHS] Well, okay. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 Tell me about this date. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. Um... 
 His name is Viktor. 
 He's an old friend from college. 
 Glaciologist. 
 - Oh. 
 - Yeah. 
 And he's usually in Antarctica 
 or the Arctic Circle, 
 but he's visiting San Jose for two days. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I was so scared to ask. 
 I thought he would laugh at me. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 But he just said he would be honored. 
 You've waited a long time. 
 I have. 
 [SIGHS] 
 And if I don't do it now, 
 then w-what if I never... 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'm not having the surgery 
 until I have sex with Viktor. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Lea and I haven't had sex in nine days. 
 Okay. 
 Um... nine days isn't a thing. 
 It is something. 
 You said you and Debbie 
 had a very good sex life. 
 I would like to know all your secrets. 
 I said that? 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Okay. Uh... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I got to test drive a Testarossa once, 
 a Ferrari, an '  . 
 Oh, my God. Beautiful car. 
 Got my friend to get us 
 a track at Thunderhill. 
 I get into the car... 
 Leather interior, stunning detail. 
 I mean, this car is ready. 
 And I kick it into gear, and it stalls. 
 I kick it into gear again, 
 and it stalls again. 
 It's jerking back and forth. 
 I'm destroying this $   ,    machine. 
 Why? Because the pedals 
 are too close together. 
 I'm... I'm stepping on the brake 
 and the accelerator at the same time. 
 Are you saying that a Ferrari 
 will not cure my dry spell with Lea? 
 No. 
 I'm trying to explain this sex book 
 that Debbie gave me 
 called Come As You Are. 
 See, uh, according to the book, 
 people think of it 
 as a sex drive, you know, 
 and that's too simple. 
 There's also a brake and an accelerator. 
 Dr. Glassman? The new 
 nursing schedule is a mess. 
 Hawks and I have some ideas 
 to make it better, 
 - if you have time today? 
 - Okay, I think... 
 I think Dr. Andrews is your guy. 
 If I could get time 
 on his calendar, I'd ask him. 
 Fine. Um, if he doesn't get back to 
 you in a week, then come back to me. 
 Uh... 
 Accelerating is 
 all the things that rev... 
 ...the engine. 
 Oh. 
 All right. Listening, 
 chocolates, 
 listening a lot. 
 And braking is everything 
 that... that gets in the way of good... 
 You know, sex. 
 Stress and work and insecurities 
 and jealousy and stress. Yes? 
 Sorry to interrupt, but we are 
 having major crackage problems 
 with the BioGlass pipettes. 
 Isn't that a President thing? 
 I have had issues talking to 
 him after the last couple months. 
 I'll send you an e-mail, 
 fill you in on all the issues. 
 I look forward to that. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Car. 
 Do you do regular maintenance? 
 Are you, you know, talking 
 and communicating and... 
 Oh, talking, texting. 
 But mostly about work. 
 Okay. 
 So, maybe a little bit less braking, 
 a little bit more accelerating. 
 You know, when you get home tonight, 
 leave your work at the door. 
 Go inside, put on some music, 
 light some candles, not too many. 
 You don't want to make an announcement. 
 How many? 
 Nine. 
 And no weather channel. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Okay. 
 I... will try. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 Okay. 
 Got a minute? 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 PARK: There's the bleeder. 
 LIM: Cauterizing. 
 This nodule's caused a lot of damage. 
 It's too bad she didn't feel 
 safe coming to a hospital. 
 Mm. One of my aunts was undocumented. 
 She never let her guard down. 
 With anyone. 
 Inserting mini-forceps into the tract. 
 But hiding it from your fiance? 
 Doesn't exactly bode well. 
 PARK: Ah, you're really ready to 
 judge this relationship, aren't you? 
 First, they're ""supportive, 
 fun, and loving,"" 
 now it's built on betrayal. 
 There's the nodule. 
 LIM: Advance a little further. 
 Then we can take the sample. 
 PARK: Which suggests that you 
 might be lacking experience 
 with long-term relationships. 
 The one thing they never are is simple. 
 The capsule's tough 
 for a pulmonary nodule. 
 The inside's friable, crumbly. 
 That's not cancer. 
 It's fungus. 
 And we just released it 
 into her bloodstream. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 What if we just let her 
 go home to see Viktor? 
 It's one night. 
 Dr. Allen, she has grade four 
 internal and external hemorrhoids, 
 which have already ruptured. 
 If it happens again while she's home, 
 she's at risk for severe blood loss. 
 I should tell her about my first time. 
 I vowed that under no circumstances, 
 I would be a virgin 
 when I went to college. 
 Senior prom, 
 my high school boyfriend and I 
 finally decided to take 
 that last big step past... 
 ""Heavy petting."" 
 Afterwards, all I could think was, 
 ""I preferred the petting."" 
 Mm, no second time without a first time. 
 Let's bring Viktor here. 
 Afterwards, we'll do the surgery, 
 and if she has a rupture, 
 there's no safer place to be 
 than in a hospital. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 The hospital has rules against alcohol, 
 illegal dr*gs, 
 patients running in socks, 
 but there is nothing 
 about consensual sex. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 It's an illness commonly 
 known as Valley Fever. 
 It's endemic to soil in the Southwest. 
 LIM: Our immediate concern is, 
 the fungus is now in your bloodstream. 
 If an infection takes root 
 in your brain or spine, 
 that could be fatal. 
 We're gonna treat you 
 with an anti-fungal 
 called amphotericin B. 
 It can be pretty intense. 
 The side effects include nausea, 
 violent chills, 
 high fever, convulsions. 
 Has Isaac been back? 
 Um, we haven't seen him. 
 We'll do what we can to 
 alleviate any discomfort. 
 Get the infusion ready. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Yeah? 
 You're appointment only now? 
 It's fine. 
 I had to establish boundaries, 
 at least until the hospital's 
 on firmer financial ground. 
 Huh. 
 There's a whole lot 
 of broken glass in the lab. 
 Is that a metaphor? 
 Yeah, and there's a whole lot 
 of broken glass in the lab. 
 It's a supplier issue. 
 Apparently news to you? 
 My assistant also filters requests 
 before they hit my desk. 
 Allows me to focus 
 on the bigger post-Ethicure adjustments. 
 - Huh. 
 - Now, is there a reason 
 for this... delightful, 
 if unscheduled visit, because... 
 St. Bon's needs a softball team. 
 There's a hospital league. 
 $    covers a roster of   . 
 The team covers bats and gloves. 
 It'll be good for morale. 
 You know, I heard something 
 about you playing softball in Montana. 
 What was your average? 
 [CHUCKLES] .    and trending up. 
 Hm. 
 Fine. The hospital can cover 
 registration fee and uniforms. 
 Gloves and bats are on you. 
 Next time, make an appointment. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Dr. Wolke? 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 I'm just swiping left again. 
 Please, interrupt. 
 I saw Ms. Torres is going on ampho-B. 
 Can we get her fiance back 
 so she has some emotional support? 
 Uh, we tried. He's not responding. 
 Pretty lousy time to ghost. 
 Maybe, but I get it. 
 You ""get"" taking off 
 when someone needs you? 
 She lied to him for years. 
 She hid things, 
 for pretty clear reasons. 
 It's still a violation of trust. 
 That can take a while to get over. 
 - Give him some time. 
 - Great empathy for him. 
 Meanwhile, your patient is 
 about to be in a lot of pain, 
 and you're judging her. 
 I'm treating her. 
 It is not my place to do 
 couples therapy. Or yours. 
 If you don't have compassion 
 for her, Dr. Wolke, 
 then maybe someone else 
 should handle her care. 
 And you can go back to 
 polishing your Tinder profile. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I have to hang her meds. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 You went all out. 
 Mm-hmm. [CHUCKLES] 
 You didn't have to bring those. 
 I stole them from the chapel. 
 - Oh. 
 - God works in mysterious ways. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Are you in any pain? 
 No. Lying here, I'm totally fine. 
 It only hurts when I walk around, 
 but what about tomorrow, 
 when Viktor's... here? 
 I got you covered. 
 Tylenol, a little Lidocaine cream. 
 Should do the trick. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You know, my mom had 
 the sex talk with me 
 when I was in the fifth grade. 
 She showed me The Joy of Sex, 
 you know, that book from the '  s. 
 Lots of... hair. 
 And, uh, when I asked her 
 to explain the pictures, 
 she got really awkward 
 and then started to cry. 
 That's not very sex-positive. 
 Well, she said she was upset 
 because I was so young 
 and I was asking all these questions. 
 I just ended up rubbing her 
 back and making her a cup of tea. 
 Oh. 
 After wanting this for so many 
 years, why am I so scared? 
 Being intimate with someone 
 feels vulnerable, 
 no matter how many times you've done it. 
 That's why it's special. 
 It will be an adventure... 
 Your adventure, on your terms. 
 Have fun, 
 tell him what you want, 
 and lube is your friend. 
 Oh, my God. [LAUGHS] 
 It's all about setting the mood.

 So... relaxed. 
 Just a bunch of friends hanging out. 
 Yeah. 
 There are so many images 
 out there of the, uh, plight 
 of the undocumented, 
 like we're just some sad story. 
 I wanted to show how we really are... 
 Cracking jokes, laughing, 
 a bunch of badasses. 
 Oh, not that I feel that way 
 at the moment. 
 [BREATHES SHARPLY] Oh! 
 I can call Isaac again. 
 Don't bother. 
 If he doesn't see how scary this all is, 
 if he can't support me, 
 then I don't want him here. 
 When I was in high school, 
 I had a chavrusa... 
 A study partner. 
 I totally fell for him. 
 His close textual readings 
 were super sexy. 
 We grew up Hasidic. 
 Micah was the first person 
 I told about being gay... 
 And my first kiss. 
 He said he was gay, too. 
 That according to two verses in Samuel, 
 so were King David and Jonathan. 
 Like I said, close textual readings. 
 [POPS LIPS] Next level. 
 Micah said we should be open. 
 We should tell our families. 
 I was scared, but I did, 
 And my dad... 
 ...lost it. 
 Our home just... imploded. 
 But Micah backed out. 
 He said he couldn't do it. 
 I lost my family 
 and never spoke to Micah again. 
 He cut you off? 
 I cut himoff. 
 He reached out to me, 
 but I... I was so angry. 
 He betrayed me and... 
 Broke my heart. 
 And then I realized how terrified 
 he must have been, too. 
 And how... 
 Alone he must feel now. 
 I miss him. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 - [GASPING] 
 - [MONITOR BEEPING, ALARM BLARING] 
 O  falling. 
 Is this from the ampho-B? 
 No. 
 - EKG steady. 
 - It's not her heart. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 The area around the nodule ruptured. 
 Your lung has collapsed. 
 We need to get her to the O.R. 
 LIM: Completing final muscular suture. 
 PARK: Lung is reinflating nicely. 
 Let's finish closing her up. 
 - JEROME: Dr. Lim? 
 - Who's talking to me? 
 This is Nurse Martel. 
 Her renal panel just came back. 
 How bad? 
 B.U.N.   , creatinine  . 
 Thanks for letting us know. 
 It's impacting both her kidneys. 
 We need to get that nodule out of there. 
 - ASHER: Now? 
 - No. 
 There's still too much fungus 
 circulating in her blood. 
 She needs around round of ampho-B 
 to clear as much fungus as we can. 
 Then we can do the kidney surgery. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Are you Viktor? 
 Brenna showed me your picture. 
 - I'm Dr. Allen. 
 - Pleased to meet you. 
 Perhaps you could point me 
 toward the gift shop? 
 I wanted to get something for Brenna. 
 What kind of a date 
 shows up empty-handed? 
 Most of them. 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. Give her these. 
 Chocolate contains tryptophan 
 and Phenylethylamine, 
 which will help to elevate your moods. 
 Oh, they are very good. 
 Okay, please get started. 
 As soon as you are done, 
 we can do the procedure. 
 Oh, uh, I owe it to Brenna not to rush. 
 Definitely worth the wait. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 You're here. 
 Uh, bearing slightly used chocolates. 
 Uh, Dr. Murphy says they... 
 they will improve our mood, 
 w-which I hope won't be necessary. 
 Always the gentleman. 
 [SIGHS] Are you sure 
 this isn't too strange? 
 Uh, well, making love 
 in a hospital is strange. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 And surprising 
 and... and completely unique. 
 [CHUCKLES] Exciting. 
 I'll be outside, guarding the door. 
 Try not to be too loud. 
 [SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS]

 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Yo. See you on the field. 
 I gave you your team. 
 My involvement ends there. 
 You're a baller, right? 
 You played in college. 
 Yeah, I also ate instant ramen 
 for breakfast. 
 I need a shortstop, a field general, 
 a boss of the infield. You're perfect. 
 I'm busy being the actual boss. 
 You're busy being a bad boss. 
 You isolate yourself 
 from your own staff. 
 They don't like you. 
 Especially since 
 this business with Salen. 
 I've got bridges to build. 
 I'll get there eventually. 
 I'm offering you a bridge 
 to build right now. 
 Show them you're on their team. 
 Maybe they'll help you right the ship. 
 I know. Mixed metaphor. 
 And by the way, 
 maybe they'll stop bothering me 
 with their problems every five minutes. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Let's have sex. 
 - [SCREAMING] 
 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 
 Shaun! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! 
 Okay. 
 Are you okay? 
 Spontaneity is not the solution. 
 No. 
 Sorry. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe we could try 
 more of a... planned surprise next time. 
 That is a good idea. 
 We should have a sex schedule. 
 Jordan recommended it. 
 Did you mention my morale boosting? 
 N-No. 
 Lea, that is very personal. 
 Yeah. Yeah, it is. 
 The... The sex schedule... sorry... 
 It just feels like 
 the ultimate buzzkill. 
 Okay. 
 Lou the janitor mentioned 
 something called a sex swing, 
 but the installation 
 sounds very cumbersome. 
 Even allowing for foreplay, 
 Viktor should be finished. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Uh... 
 [RETCHING] 
 God. 
 This feels worse than the last time. 
 The nausea, the pain... 
 ASHER: We have to clear 
 as much fungus from your blood 
 as possible before surgery. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 I got your message. 
 Thanks for coming back. 
 You lied to me. 
 I don't know what's going on anymore. 
 Or what to trust. 
 Of course you don't. 
 I didn't give you a chance. 
 I didn't trust you, and I should have. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 You don't have to forgive me,

 This is Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 BRENNA: Help. 
 Mm. 
 Um... 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 What happened? 
 Well, um, we finished... 
 Both of us. 
 Yay. [CHUCKLES] 
 Um, but we... 
 - Um... he's... 
 - I-I-I seem to be stuck. 
 Oh, you must have vaginismus. 
 What? 
 Your pelvic floor 
 is having a muscle spasm, 
 - and it's holding... 
 - Oh! 
 Shaun. 
 It's very rare in humans, 
 but it is common in mammals 
 who need to ensure fertilization. 
 Once your pelvic walls relax, 
 everything should go back to normal. 
 Oh, my God. 
 I am so sorry. 
 You came to do me a favor, 
 - and now we're literally stuck. 
 - No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
 This is a beautiful choice you made. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 And now that I know that 
 we're gonna be okay, uh... 
 It's actually quite nice. 
 Yes, it is. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 That was... 
 Lovely. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [COWBELL RINGS] 
 Mm. 
 I owe you an apology. 
 It's okay. 
 The ice packs are really helping. 
 Not that. 
 I'm sorry for brushing you off. 
 You've been trying to get us 
 out of this dry spell, 
 and I've done nothing. 
 About the sex schedule... 
 My parents used to have one. 
 They used to mark our 
 kitchen calendar with ""S.T."" 
 They claimed it was for ""Steak Tonight,"" 
 but we didn't have steak that often. 
 We finally realized it stood 
 for... ""Sexy Time."" 
 Oh. 
 I-I don't want my sex life 
 to be like my parents'. 
 But they have been married for    years. 
 Yeah, they have. 
 They seem happy. 
 I think it is nice that they 
 still want to touch each other. 
 I need to go remove some hemorrhoids. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 We removed the nodule, 
 and your kidney function is improving. 
 A few rounds of ampho-B to go, 
 but we think you're in the clear. 
 Thank you, Dr. Park. 
 We'll get through this. All of it. 
 And I won't freak out again. 
 I'll step up. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry it took me so long. 
 You and me? 
 Yeah. You and me. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 How did I do? 
 The surgery was a success. 
 And as long as you follow 
 the recovery protocols, 
 you should have no further problems. 
 Look who I found in the gift shop. 
 I wanted to see how you were doing, 
 and, uh, give you these. 
 Aww. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] And ask 
 if you might be open 
 to another visit next month. 
 There's a polar microbes 
 conference in San Francisco 
 that I, uh, was considering attending. 
 I'd love that. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE]

 Cafeteria closed 
 while you were in the O.R., 
 so I sat a couple of meal trays aside. 
 Oh, my God. I'm starving. 
 Thank you. 
 And... 
 Thanks for the push. 
 We've got grilled salmon. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - Can be a little dry, 
 although Ms. Shenoy in 
 seems to like it. 
 - Mm. 
 - Penne pesto. 
 Sounds promising, I know, 
 but lower your expectations. 
 - Oh. 
 - And finally, 
 the humble-but-classic grilled chicken. 
 Mm. 
 Even my  -year-old niece loves it, 
 and she's got the palate 
 of a  -year-old. 
 I would have gone with the pesto. 
 I could tell. 
 I'm sold. 
 Hit me with that chicken. 
 [SNAPS FINGERS] You got it. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Unless we head over to Tres Reyes, 
 upgrade to insanely good tamales. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Are you... asking me out? 
 In, like, a date-y way? 
 Looks like it. 
 Wait. 
 You're gay? 
 Nothing gets by you, huh? 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 An upgrade to insanely good 
 tamales sounds perfect. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY]

 MAN: All right, Reznick! 
 - Way to battle. 
 - Aw! 
 Park, you're up! Allen on deck. 
 I got some intel. First up is a 
 fastball, followed by a change-up. 
 Yeah, that's because he 
 doesn't have anything else, man. 
 - His curve ball's a disaster. 
 - Good to know. 
 - All right. You got this. 
 - Dilallo, in the hole. 
 Oh. It's  :  .Yeah. 
 Sorry. Gotta go. 
 What do you mean, you gotta go? 
 You're... You're the cleanup hitter. 
 We are on a schedule. 
 Go, Park! 
 WOMAN: Oh! 
 - Strike! 
 - Ah! 
 Oh, that's a ball! That was high! 
 MAN:  - ! 
 Nice turn on 
 that double play last inning. 
 Thanks. 
 If only you could handle our 
 schedule with the same skill. 
 REFEREE:   and  . 
 You got some ideas? 
 Actually, yeah. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I'm listening. 
 MAN: Oh! 
 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
 Go, Park! Yeah! Good job, man! 
 Park! 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 It just feels a little weird. 
 Like we're on the clock, you know? 
 I would offer you a chocolate 
 to help you relax, 
 but I gave them away to Viktor. 
 Who's Viktor? 
 A very nice Arctic explorer 
 who came to the hospital 
 to have sex with my patient. 
 Oh. 
 How full service. 
 It was remarkable. 
 His penis got stuck 
 in my patient's vag*na. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 No, it didn't. 
 Oh, yes, it did. 
 No. 
 It did.

 Fainted coming off a plane at SFO. 
 Fiance said she's had 
 a persistent cough, 
 pain in her chest and abdomen. 
 How long has she had these symptoms? 
 ISAAC: Months, on and off. 
 I kept telling her to go to a doctor. 
 Soft and non-tender, 
 no distention or guarding present. 
 Uh... Isaac, what's... what's happening? 
 Ms. Torres, I'm Dr. Lim. 
 You're at St. Bonaventure Hospital. 
 You collapsed at the airport. 
 I'm... I'm not covered. 
 My insurance lapsed. 
 We can fast-track your access 
 to St. Bonaventure's uninsured program. 
 Any recent stressors? 
 I've been traveling a lot for work. 
 Deep breath, please. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 She's a photographer. 
 She documents immigrant

 I tagged along this last trip.

 We need a chest X-ray. 
 Hey. 
 We got this. 
 You and me. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 What do you do for work? 
 Uh, I am one of the research professors 
 of the Jane Austen project at Stanford. 
 I imagine you sit a lot? 
 Well, it would be unethical 
 to read a first edition 
 of Sense and Sensibility standing up. 
 That explains why you're 
 in so much pain. 
 You have severe hemorrhoids. 
 Well... Can you give me 
 a salve or something? 
 This is... beyond salve. 
 They seem like a cool couple. 
 They seem fine. 
 Torres imaging come through yet? 
 Not yet. 
 Supportive, fun, loving, 
 but not in a gross, performative way. 
 You picked up a lot in two minutes. 
 Sounds like someone wants a boyfriend. 
 I have been considering 
 venturing out of Hookuptown 
 for something more serious, 
 which requires finding 
 someone to get serious about. 
 That does tend to be the hard part. 
 Well, that's why I've decided 
 to raise the bar, 
 only date guys that check all the boxes. 
 So, your plan is to be more 
 open by being more closed? 
 [TABLET CHIMES]

 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 LEA: Hi. 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 So, about this morning, 
 when you came home 
 and caught me, you know... 
 Boosting my own morale... 
 I used to boost my own morale 
 a lot before we got together. 
 But I don't anymore 
 because we usually have 
 very satisfying sex. 
 Yes, we do. 
 Absolutely, we do. 
 Did you need a boost 
 because we haven't had sex in nine days? 
 I didn't know we were counting. 
 Our average is every  .  days. 
 It has been a stressful few months. 
 If you wanted a morale boost, 
 why didn't you want me to do it for you? 
 No, it's... it's not that. 
 I-I just... I don't know. 
 I woke up and had a few minutes 
 and wanted to take the edge off. 
 Is it... the same 
 as when we're together? 
 No. 
 It's... different. 
 It's definitely not as good, 
 but it is... faster. 
 Oh, I can go faster. 
 [CHUCKLING] No, Shaun. 
 Boosting my own morale 
 is not a substitute 
 for being with you, ever. 
 And I did try to get things going 
 a couple times last week, 
 but you were busy. 
 You didn't ring the cowbell. 
 It wasn't cowbell worthy. 
 We agreed if we were off course, 
 we'd ring the cowbell. 
 We are not off course. 
 We're having a dry spell, 
 and it will blow over. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 That is a lot of weather terms. 
 I'm not sure they apply. 
 Yeah. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Anorectal ailments are one of the 
 oldest recorded medical conditions. 
 One early remedy was to 
 burn them off with hot coals. 
 We can remove yours surgically, 
 but we need to do it right away. 
 Isn't there some way we could 
 schedule it for next week? 
 Your hemorrhoids have already ruptured. 
 You're at risk of serious complications. 
 Oh. 
 The surgery is now routine 
 and effective. 
 No hot coals. 
 MORGAN: But the recovery 
 can be quite painful. 
 You'll need a special diet 
 and sitz baths. 
 No exercise or exertion, including sex, 
 for six to eight weeks post-op. 
 No sex? Why? 
 The wounds need time to heal. 
 We can get you on the schedule 
 for later today. 
 The X-rays show two nodules 
 in your left lung, 
 possibly cancerous. 
 We'll know more after the biopsy. 
 It's a simple procedure. 
 Um, the... the biopsy... 
 Is covered under the uninsured program? 
 It all is. 
 And we'll run a few labs 
 and get you started on fluids. 
 Is this arm okay for the IV? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Listen, Mari, 
 I was on the phone with your insurance. 
 What? W-Why? 
 To save you the hassle. 
 - Sorry, I need you to hold still. 
 - Oh. Sorry. 
 You... You shouldn't have called them. 
 Why not? We need to get this sorted out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Mari, whatever is going on, 
 you can tell me. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Um... 
 My insurance didn't lapse. 
 I, uh... I lost it. 
 Because, um... 
 I'm undocumented. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 JORDAN: Brenna? 
 W-Where is our patient? 
 She's not in the bathroom, 
 and her clothes and personal 
 belongings are all gone. 
 Code green. We have a runner. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I checked the whole 
 second floor. No Brenna. 
 She's not in the cafeteria 
 or the lobby or the gift shop. 
 We should check all the exits. 
 Lea and I haven't had sex for nine days. 
 Lenore, the gift-shop cashier, 
 she recommended light bondage. 
 Dr. Park suggested 
 a romantic bubble bath, 
 but Lea and I don't agree 
 on water temperature. 
 You both are busy. 
 Have you tried scheduling it? 
 Reliability is sexy. 
 [WOMAN SCREAMING] 
 I think we found her. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 All right, time for your biopsy. 
 I'll have her back 
 in about an hour or so. 
 I should drop the bags off 
 at the apartment. 
 Isaac, can we please talk about this 
 before I go into my procedure? 
 We've been together two years. 
 I was gonna tell you. 
 When? 
 The wedding? 
 I promised myself that if 
 marriage were ever on the table 
 for real, that I'd tell you, 
 but when you proposed, 
 my DACA renewal had just been rejected. 
 And it really freaked me out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It was, uh... 
 It was all because of a stupid 
 marijuana DUI on my record. 
 Another thing you've been hiding. 
 It was years ago. 
 Cops pulled me over for a tail light. 
 They searched and they found edibles, 
 and they arrested me for driving high, 
 which I wasn't. 
 [COUGHING] 
 Okay, let's get her 
 some humidified oxygen. 
 [COUGHING CONTINUES] 
 I was... [COUGHS] 
 I was trying to get it expunged.

 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 I'm gonna go. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [GASPING] 
 [COUGHING] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I can get rid of that for you. 
 There's blood in her sputum. 
 You're bleeding 
 from your lungs and airway. 
 Let's get to the O.R., stat. 
 [COUGHING] 
 BRENNA: I'm sorry I ran. 
 I know I need surgery. 
 JORDAN: You're scared. I understand. 
 No, it's not just that. I have this date 
 that I've been waiting 
 a really long time for. 
 And a rain check poses a problem? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I am... 
 A virgin. 
 I am    years old 
 and I have never had sex. 
 [LAUGHS, SIGHS] 
 Because of your religion? 
 Honestly, I don't know. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I mean, freshman year in college, 
 I-I made this really detailed list 
 of what I wanted in a boyfriend, 
 and then I fell madly in love 
 with my work. 
 For a while, I thought 
 I wasn't having sex 
 because I was obsessed with Jane Austen. 
 It's commonly believed that 
 she was a virgin when she died. 
 She was obsessed with her work, too. 
 I n... I never stopped looking. 
 But every year that I waited, 
 it just got harder 
 to imagine telling someone 
 I'd met a couple times 
 over coffee or drinks 
 that I... had never had sex. 
 I just... 
 I just felt so ashamed. 
 You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 [LAUGHS] Well, okay. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 Tell me about this date. 
 Really? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Okay. Um... 
 His name is Viktor. 
 He's an old friend from college. 
 Glaciologist. 
 - Oh. 
 - Yeah. 
 And he's usually in Antarctica 
 or the Arctic Circle, 
 but he's visiting San Jose for two days. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I was so scared to ask. 
 I thought he would laugh at me. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 But he just said he would be honored. 
 You've waited a long time. 
 I have. 
 [SIGHS] 
 And if I don't do it now, 
 then w-what if I never... 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'm not having the surgery 
 until I have sex with Viktor. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Lea and I haven't had sex in nine days. 
 Okay. 
 Um... nine days isn't a thing. 
 It is something. 
 You said you and Debbie 
 had a very good sex life. 
 I would like to know all your secrets. 
 I said that? 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Okay. Uh... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I got to test drive a Testarossa once, 
 a Ferrari, an '  . 
 Oh, my God. Beautiful car. 
 Got my friend to get us 
 a track at Thunderhill. 
 I get into the car... 
 Leather interior, stunning detail. 
 I mean, this car is ready. 
 And I kick it into gear, and it stalls. 
 I kick it into gear again, 
 and it stalls again. 
 It's jerking back and forth. 
 I'm destroying this $   ,    machine. 
 Why? Because the pedals 
 are too close together. 
 I'm... I'm stepping on the brake 
 and the accelerator at the same time. 
 Are you saying that a Ferrari 
 will not cure my dry spell with Lea? 
 No. 
 I'm trying to explain this sex book 
 that Debbie gave me 
 called Come As You Are. 
 See, uh, according to the book, 
 people think of it 
 as a sex drive, you know, 
 and that's too simple. 
 There's also a brake and an accelerator. 
 Dr. Glassman? The new 
 nursing schedule is a mess. 
 Hawks and I have some ideas 
 to make it better, 
 - if you have time today? 
 - Okay, I think... 
 I think Dr. Andrews is your guy. 
 If I could get time 
 on his calendar, I'd ask him. 
 Fine. Um, if he doesn't get back to 
 you in a week, then come back to me. 
 Uh... 
 Accelerating is 
 all the things that rev... 
 ...the engine. 
 Oh. 
 All right. Listening, 
 chocolates, 
 listening a lot. 
 And braking is everything 
 that... that gets in the way of good... 
 You know, sex. 
 Stress and work and insecurities 
 and jealousy and stress. Yes? 
 Sorry to interrupt, but we are 
 having major crackage problems 
 with the BioGlass pipettes. 
 Isn't that a President thing? 
 I have had issues talking to 
 him after the last couple months. 
 I'll send you an e-mail, 
 fill you in on all the issues. 
 I look forward to that. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Car. 
 Do you do regular maintenance? 
 Are you, you know, talking 
 and communicating and... 
 Oh, talking, texting. 
 But mostly about work. 
 Okay. 
 So, maybe a little bit less braking, 
 a little bit more accelerating. 
 You know, when you get home tonight, 
 leave your work at the door. 
 Go inside, put on some music, 
 light some candles, not too many. 
 You don't want to make an announcement. 
 How many? 
 Nine. 
 And no weather channel. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Okay. 
 I... will try. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 Okay. 
 Got a minute? 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 PARK: There's the bleeder. 
 LIM: Cauterizing. 
 This nodule's caused a lot of damage. 
 It's too bad she didn't feel 
 safe coming to a hospital. 
 Mm. One of my aunts was undocumented. 
 She never let her guard down. 
 With anyone. 
 Inserting mini-forceps into the tract. 
 But hiding it from your fiance? 
 Doesn't exactly bode well. 
 PARK: Ah, you're really ready to 
 judge this relationship, aren't you? 
 First, they're ""supportive, 
 fun, and loving,"" 
 now it's built on betrayal. 
 There's the nodule. 
 LIM: Advance a little further. 
 Then we can take the sample. 
 PARK: Which suggests that you 
 might be lacking experience 
 with long-term relationships. 
 The one thing they never are is simple. 
 The capsule's tough 
 for a pulmonary nodule. 
 The inside's friable, crumbly. 
 That's not cancer. 
 It's fungus. 
 And we just released it 
 into her bloodstream. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 What if we just let her 
 go home to see Viktor? 
 It's one night. 
 Dr. Allen, she has grade four 
 internal and external hemorrhoids, 
 which have already ruptured. 
 If it happens again while she's home, 
 she's at risk for severe blood loss. 
 I should tell her about my first time. 
 I vowed that under no circumstances, 
 I would be a virgin 
 when I went to college. 
 Senior prom, 
 my high school boyfriend and I 
 finally decided to take 
 that last big step past... 
 ""Heavy petting."" 
 Afterwards, all I could think was, 
 ""I preferred the petting."" 
 Mm, no second time without a first time. 
 Let's bring Viktor here. 
 Afterwards, we'll do the surgery, 
 and if she has a rupture, 
 there's no safer place to be 
 than in a hospital. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 The hospital has rules against alcohol, 
 illegal dr*gs, 
 patients running in socks, 
 but there is nothing 
 about consensual sex. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 It's an illness commonly 
 known as Valley Fever. 
 It's endemic to soil in the Southwest. 
 LIM: Our immediate concern is, 
 the fungus is now in your bloodstream. 
 If an infection takes root 
 in your brain or spine, 
 that could be fatal. 
 We're gonna treat you 
 with an anti-fungal 
 called amphotericin B. 
 It can be pretty intense. 
 The side effects include nausea, 
 violent chills, 
 high fever, convulsions. 
 Has Isaac been back? 
 Um, we haven't seen him. 
 We'll do what we can to 
 alleviate any discomfort. 
 Get the infusion ready. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Yeah? 
 You're appointment only now? 
 It's fine. 
 I had to establish boundaries, 
 at least until the hospital's 
 on firmer financial ground. 
 Huh. 
 There's a whole lot 
 of broken glass in the lab. 
 Is that a metaphor? 
 Yeah, and there's a whole lot 
 of broken glass in the lab. 
 It's a supplier issue. 
 Apparently news to you? 
 My assistant also filters requests 
 before they hit my desk. 
 Allows me to focus 
 on the bigger post-Ethicure adjustments. 
 - Huh. 
 - Now, is there a reason 
 for this... delightful, 
 if unscheduled visit, because... 
 St. Bon's needs a softball team. 
 There's a hospital league. 
 $    covers a roster of   . 
 The team covers bats and gloves. 
 It'll be good for morale. 
 You know, I heard something 
 about you playing softball in Montana. 
 What was your average? 
 [CHUCKLES] .    and trending up. 
 Hm. 
 Fine. The hospital can cover 
 registration fee and uniforms. 
 Gloves and bats are on you. 
 Next time, make an appointment. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 Dr. Wolke? 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 I'm just swiping left again. 
 Please, interrupt. 
 I saw Ms. Torres is going on ampho-B. 
 Can we get her fiance back 
 so she has some emotional support? 
 Uh, we tried. He's not responding. 
 Pretty lousy time to ghost. 
 Maybe, but I get it. 
 You ""get"" taking off 
 when someone needs you? 
 She lied to him for years. 
 She hid things, 
 for pretty clear reasons. 
 It's still a violation of trust. 
 That can take a while to get over. 
 - Give him some time. 
 - Great empathy for him. 
 Meanwhile, your patient is 
 about to be in a lot of pain, 
 and you're judging her. 
 I'm treating her. 
 It is not my place to do 
 couples therapy. Or yours. 
 If you don't have compassion 
 for her, Dr. Wolke, 
 then maybe someone else 
 should handle her care. 
 And you can go back to 
 polishing your Tinder profile. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 I have to hang her meds. 
 [♪♪♪♪♪♪] 
 You went all out. 
 Mm-hmm. [CHUCKLES] 
 You didn't have to bring those. 
 I stole them from the chapel. 
 - Oh. 
 - God works in mysterious ways. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Are you in any pain? 
 No. Lying here, I'm totally fine. 
 It only hurts when I walk around, 
 but what about tomorrow, 
 when Viktor's... here? 
 I got you covered. 
 Tylenol, a little Lidocaine cream. 
 Should do the trick. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You know, my mom had 
 the sex talk with me 
 when I was in the fifth grade. 
 She showed me The Joy of Sex, 
 you know, that book from the '  s. 
 Lots of... hair. 
 And, uh, when I asked her 
 to explain the pictures, 
 she got really awkward 
 and then started to cry. 
 That's not very sex-positive. 
 Well, she said she was upset 
 because I was so young 
 and I was asking all these questions. 
 I just ended up rubbing her 
 back and making her a cup of tea. 
 Oh. 
 After wanting this for so many 
 years, why am I so scared? 
 Being intimate with someone 
 feels vulnerable, 
 no matter how many times you've done it. 
 That's why it's special. 
 It will be an adventure... 
 Your adventure, on your terms. 
 Have fun,

 and lube is your friend.

 The brain tumor is obstructing CSF flow,

 If we go into his brain while 
 his kidneys are impaired,

 There's gonna be 
 some serious blood loss. 
 Well, we think we have a better plan. 
 We ligate the feeding artery

 we also minimize the risk of S.I.A.D.H.,

 Will you join us for

 Uh, I'd love to,

 how to save your life. 
 Am I dying tomorrow?

 Shabbos is more important.

 No, it's beautiful.

 No. In those dreams,

 Okay.

 Well, that's a good thing, isn't it? 
 Is it? It doesn't feel like it is. 
 Well, you don't normally pick 
 up on non-verbal cues, right? 
 That's quite a leap. 
 Lea says she's disappointed 
 that we are having our wedding 
 at the courthouse, 
 but she also says she wants to 
 have our wedding at the courthouse. 
 Not quite as big a leap

 I want to respect what she wants, 
 but I also want to respect 
 her disappointment.

 with two blue handles. 
 - How many do you need? 
 - As many as you can find. 
 There's a third drawer down there. 
 [CLICK] 
 Safest bet is to remove 
 the damaged lobe. 
 That's half her liver. 
 We can do an angio-embolization instead. 
 If that goes south, she'd need 
 a major transfusion. 
 That can't happen. We're in a lockdown. 
 [SHAUN] A hemi-hepatectomy 
 would decrease 
 her life expectancy by ten years. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Life expectancy, Shaun? 
 She has    minutes, maybe, 
 unless we can stop his hemorrhage. 
 You are being shortsighted. 
 I'm very shortsighted. 
 I want to keep her alive. 
 [JEROME] Dr. Glassman? 
 Dr. Andrews needs your help 
 with Villanueva. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Ventricle is sewn up. 
 Shaun, you are going to cut out the 
 damaged lobe, do you understand? 
 Yes. 
 Okay. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Full thickness tracheal 
 laceration with sub-q emphysema 
 and a nick in her jugular 
 below the facial branch. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] And the 
 left carotid is shredded. 
 We're gonna have to patch that up first. 
 I'm thinking closed stent. 
 If we have to anti-coagulate 
 her, she'll bleed out. 
 We got to stop the flow, 
 tie off the artery upstream. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] She's unconscious. 
 There's no way to test 
 the collateral circulation 
 to see if there's enough 
 to perfuse her brain. 
 She's young. 
 I'm willing to take that bet. 
 You're willing to risk a massive stroke? 
 As opposed to letting 
 her bleed to death? Yeah. 
 Vascular clamp and a silk tie. 
 [GASPS] Oh! 
 [GROANING, MOANING] 
 No, no, please, please. Ow! 
 Tender with guarding and rigidity. 
 His bowel's perforated. 
 Okay, well... 
 I'll look for supplies in case 
 we need to operate in here. 
 Just lock the door behind me. 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 [JORDAN] Dr. Murphy? 
 The bleeding is confined 
 to an aberrant vessel. 
 We do not need to take half her liver. 
 We can do the angio-embolization safely. 
 But you told Dr. Glassman you 
 were gonna do the hemi-hepatectomy. 
 Parameters have changed. 
 The angio-embolization 
 is the proper choice. 
 [LEA] Should someone 
 let Dr. Glassman know? 
 Inform him if you like. 
 I need to proceed to avoid 
 further hemorrhaging. 
 Argon beam coagulator. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SOFTLY] Morgan? 
 [OWEN] Stay where you are. 
 Don't move. 
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DOOR RATTLING] 
 - What's going on? 
 - Shh! 
 What's the tray for? 
 Where were you going? 
 [WHISPERING] I'm sorry. I just... 
 There's a kid in there 
 with a perforated bowel. 
 If we don't do surgery, 
 he's going to die. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 Shaun, did you change the surgical plan? 
 The parameters it was based on changed. 
 I adjusted accordingly. 
 And ignored my instructions 
 in favor of what you wanted to do? 
 Yes. 
 Why didn't you ask me? 
 Why didn't anybody ask me? 
 [JORDAN] It seemed like 
 a reasonable call. 
 That's not your call to make. 
 Nor is it yours. 
 How far into this are we? 
 [SHAUN] I located the site 
 of contrast extravasation 
 and the catheter is in position. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Well, that's just great. 
 We're locked in. Gimme a coil. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 There was a skyway, bridge-type thing. 
 I went there for a smoke once. 
 Not that far off the ground. 
 What are you gonna do? 
 Jump? It would k*ll you. 
 - Where is it? 
 - I-I-It's two floors down. 
 All the stairs and elevators 
 are locked off. 
 There's really... 
 There's no way out of here. 
 No! 
 Come on! Let's go! Let's go! 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
 Open the door! Open up! I have a g*n. 
 I'm gonna sh**t this doctor in 
 the head if you don't open the door! 
 Morgan, don't! 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I have three hostages! 
 You stay back or I start sh**ting! 
 [SHAUN] One area 
 of extravasation remaining. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Deploying my coil. 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 [BEEPING INCREASES] 
 [JORDAN] Heart rate    . 
 Big drop in BP. 
 Coils are fine. Where's the bleeding? 
 [SHAUN] Large collateral vessel 
 must be damaged. 
 We can inject gel foam particles 
 for distal embolization. 
 [RAPID BEEPING] 
 BP's critical. 
 - I'm gonna pivot back. 
 - [SHAUN] I'm almost there. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] We're going to 
 resect the liver. 
 [SHAUN] Don't touch her. 
 I am injecting contrast... 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] I am removing 
 the packing, Shaun. 
 No. I see how to stop the bleed. 
 Injecting particles. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 Complete embolization 
 with no residual bleeding. 
 [HIGH-PITCH BEEP] 
 BP's rising. 
 [BEEPING SLOWS] 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Okay. 
 Let's close her up. 
 It was a reasonable call. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Nice work with 
 the needle driver. 
 - [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
 - [JEROME] Thanks. 
 Jerome. 
 There's a hostage standoff 
 on the fifth floor. 
 Everyone's fine. 
 But it's Dr. Reznick and Asher. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I'm sorry. 
 Let's finish this. 
 You guys stay back or you 
 won't like what happens. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 How is she? 
 - Who? 
 - Dalisay. 
 Now you're concerned for her well-being? 
 I love her. 
 Ezra? 
 Ezra. 
 He needs surgery or he'll die. 
 Do it in here. 
 I need to make a call. 
 Do you have a ten-blade? 
 No, just a fifteen. 
 Okay. How many GIA staplers? 
 None, but we can 
 hand-sew or anastomosis. 
 As long as he doesn't have 
 a history of bowel surgery. 
 He does. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I love you. 
 If we open him up here, we'll k*ll him. 
 I spoke to the OR earlier. 
 Your ex, Lim, that guard, 
 they're all expected 
 to make full recoveries. 
 So, right now, all they have 
 you on is attempted m*rder. 
 But if this kid dies... 
 You... You didn't talk to the OR. 
 I did. 
 You, take him out of here. 
 You're staying with me. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I have blood on my sleeve. 
 You okay? 
 It's not my blood. 
 Okay. I just... 
 I don't know. I was concerned about you. 
 You shouldn't be. 
 I made the right call, 
 and Dr. Lim's recovering. 
 Dr. Lim's waking up. 
 I have to go. 
 Oh. I'm here if you need me. 
 Thank you. I don't. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 My dad beat up my mom. 
 Put her in the hospital a couple times. 
 I hated his guts. 
 Spent my childhood saying I'd... 
 I'd be different than him. 
 My dad's dying. 
 He has a couple weeks... 
 at most. 
 Cancer. 
 I just put him on a plane 
 back to New York. 
 What went wrong between us... 
 will never get fixed. 
 We're out of time. 
 There's still time for you. 
 It's okay. 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 Yeah, she's recovering. 
 She had trauma to her carotid, 
 trachea, and jugular, 
 but we were able to repair it all. 
 You had pulmonary hilum injuries, 
 a nicked ventricle, 
 a grade four liver laceration. 
 It was a tough call, but Dr. Murphy here 
 opted for an angio-embolization 
 and managed to preserve 
 your entire liver. 
 You're welcome. 
 A security guard was stabbed, 
 but he's expected 
 to make a full recovery. 
 - Oh. 
 - [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 - Abdominal pain? 
 - Oh! 
 - Right upper quadrant? 
 - Mm. 
 - Higher? 
 - [GRUNTS] 
 - Her heart. 
 - [RAPID BEEPING] 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Well, you'll serve your sentence, 
 make amends, and then... 
 and then start again. 
 There's only two ways out of this. 
 You either turn yourself in, 
 or you die. 
 [WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Thank you. 
 Is Dalisay really still alive? 
 I have no idea. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 [SWAT OFFICER] Drop the g*n! 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [g*nsh*t] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 There. 
 A traumatic VSD in the 
 inferior portion of the septum. 
 The cut went deeper than we thought. 
 The defect can be repaired 
 with a GORE-TEX patch. 
 [DOORS SLIDE OPEN] 
 I need help. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ASHER] SWAT got him. 
 Multiple GSWs to the arm and chest. 
 Was in PEA, but we got him back. 
 BP    over palp. 
 Dr. Glassman! 
 Ash. You okay? 
 OR two, set up for bypass with 
 whatever O-Neg we have left. 
 Aaron, you handle this with Dr. Wolke. 
 - Shaun, we'll fix Lim's heart. 
 - [SHAUN] Okay. 
 Wait. Does Lim need bypass, too? 
 We've only got enough tubing and 
 cannulas to operate one machine. 
 Resupply doesn't come in until  :   a.m. 
 Are we pretending that there's a debate? 
 We're not risking Lim's life 
 for this man. 
 We do have another option. 
 We can repair Lim's heart with an 
 occluder device. She won't need bypass. 
 No. No. That is a terrible idea. 
 Percutaneous closure is too risky. 
 Open heart surgery is the optimal 
 procedure for traumatic VSD. 
 I, I know, but he will die 
 without bypass. 
 Lim's surgery will just be 
 harder without it, but doable. 
 Do you agree? 
 I agree with Dr. Andrews. 
 No. This is not fair. 
 Dr. Lim didn't hurt anyone. He did. 
 And now we need to help her. 
 She needs the bypass machine. 
 I've made my decision. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] I've deployed 
 the occluder device. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] Slipped through. 
 Placing again. 
 Looks good on the frontal. 
 No. Still not seating. 
 We should have used bypass.

 - No, no, don't touch me!

 No, don't touch me! Don't touch me, 
 okay? Don't... Don't touch me! 
 Don't touch me, okay? Don't touch me!

 Dr. Glassman, please. 
 Shaun? 
 Dr. Glassman, please, 
 we need you in there. 
 If they're placing a device, 
 they need Shaun, not me. 
 Shaun? 
 [DISTORTED] Shaun, please. 
 Look at me. 
 Shaun? Shaun? 
 [STEVE] 
 Shaun? 
 Shaun. 
 It's a hell of a wedding day, Shaun. 
 I couldn't save you. 
 You were a kid. 
 You died because of me. 
 I was walking backwards 
 on top of a train. 
 You only left home because of me. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] 
 Shaun? 
 Shaun? 
 I gotta go. 
 Maybe we should show him the surgery? 
 You said they needed Shaun. 
 Video-call me from the inside 
 and we'll show him the problem. 
 Okay. 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 [JORDAN] Maybe there's not 
 enough uninjured tissue. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] It's not that. 
 - [RAPID BEEPING] 
 - SVT. Push adenosine. 
 Shaun? 
 Shaun, I'm gonna show you 
 the front and lateral views. 
 Can you see 
 why the device isn't seating? 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Shaun? 
 Please focus. 
 [STEVE] 
 You're right. 
 I left home 
 'cause I wanted to protect you. 
 My big brother who I loved. 
 Nothing could've changed that. 
 Nothing could've changed 
 where I was that day. 
 None of it is your fault. 
 You remember what I said to you 
 when I gave you the scalpel, right? 
 [YOUNG STEVE] 
 Never forget. 
 You can do anything. 
 You can do this. 
 You can save your friend. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You just need to look. 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] Okay. 
 [LEA] Shaun? 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 Shaun, can you see that? 
 I know what to do. 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 - We need more pressors. 
 - We're maxed out. 
 There's a second VSD. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] We would have seen it. 
 Here. 
 We assumed it was 
 ventricular turbulence. 
 It's oblong. 
 Deploy a second device 
 and angle it posteriorly.

 Hi. 
 Hello. I have to wait 
 for Dr. Lim to wake up. 
 You should go home and sleep. 
 I'm not spending my wedding 
 night across town from you. 
 I'll take a nap 
 in the residents' lounge. 
 I saw Steve earlier. 
 Oh. 
 He told me it wasn't my fault he died. 
 Do you believe him? 
 I'm... trying. 
 Tonight was very hard.

 I would not have been able

 As much as I loved you before... 
 I love you even more now. 
 I am so happy you are my wife. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Do you feel married now? 
 I think I do. [CHUCKLES] 
 I thought I was gonna die today. 
 And I didn't think about that job. 
 I thought about you. 
 I just e-mailed New York Medical Center. 
 I turned them down. 
 You need to e-mail them back. 
 Tell them you made a mistake. 
 When you decided to take the job... 
 you chose your career over us. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 And, uh... 
 I finally had to face it. 
 That's who you are. 
 And you're not gonna change. 
 But I did change. 
 Today. 
 For the moment.

 I don't know. Ask. 
 Is the answer always yes?

 Whoo! 
 Welcome back, Chief. 
 Thank you. 
 I've never been

 - We've missed you so much. 
 - Ah. 
 It's only been a few months. 
 It's been    and a half weeks. 
 Awkward. 
 Her and Murphy. 
 It's awkward between 
 Murphy and most people. 
 He didn't paralyze everyone. 
 He didn't paralyze her. 
 He saved her life. 
 If he would've done the surgery 
 Glassman ordered him to do... 
 There's no way to know what 
 the outcome would have been. 
 The M&M was clear on that. 
 The final determination 
 was ""inconclusive."" 
 I'd hug you, but I'd have 
 to steal your wheelchair.

 It was incredibly helpful. 
 And I'd like to thank Dr. Murphy. 
 You saved my life. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oof. So awkward. 
 Doctors Wolke and Allen, 
 meet our new first years, 
 Doctors Danica Powell and Daniel Perez. 
 Newbies. 
 - Don't call them that. 
 - Sorry. 
 Welcome to St. Bonaventure. 
 Thanks. Glad to be here. 
 I look forward to working with you both. 
 Have a great first day. 
 Thank you. 
 Nurse Hawks showed us around, 
 introduced us to the OR staff. 
 Everyone seems super helpful. 
 I'm sure they were. 
 Hmm. 
 You want the soldier or the farmboy? 
 Naval Academy grads are called sailors, 
 not soldiers. 
 Well, she's been in combat. 
 That makes her a soldier in my book. 
 They both have excellent USMLE scores. 
 Well, she has more 
 real-world experience, 
 but he'll be useful getting 
 extra help from the nurses, 
 which could come in handy 
 on our first day. 
 It's not our first day. 
 We've been here five years 
 and have leadership experience. 
 Being an attending 
 shouldn't be much different 
 than being a senior resident. 
 I'll take Handsome Dan. 
 Okay. 
 Good morning. 
 I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I'm an attending at San Jose St. 
 Bonaventure Hospital. 
 You and Dr. Wolke will be with me today. 
 Allen and Perez, you're with me 
 in the ER today. 
 Actually, I was just about 
 to take Perez. 
 You may have been ""about to,"" 
 but I just did. 
 - Come on. Let's go. 
 - Hold on. 
 Dr. Murphy and I... 
 Were decorating your new shared office, 
 while I was getting 
 this approved by Andrews. 
 Oblivious to anyone else's 
 needs but your own, as usual. 
 Pathetically blaming everyone 
 else for your problems, 
 as usual. 
 They used to be in a relationship. 
 It ended badly. 
 Let's go. 
 It still feels like I'm choking. 
 The EMTs said they could barely 
 get into your apartment. 
 Looked like you hadn't 
 been able to clean up 
 or take out the trash in months. 
 Those are my collections. 
 It's none of their business. 
 Large, palpable anterior mass. 
 When was the last time you saw a doctor? 
 I don't know. Ten, twenty years. 
 When was the last time 
 you left your house? 
 What does that matter? 
 We just want to make sure 
 you're taking care of yourself. 
 If you want, 
 we could have a social worker 
 come down to talk to you. 
 You know, this is exactly why 
 I don't come to hospitals. 
 All you want to do is meddle in things 
 that are none of your damn business. 
 It looks like you may need some surgery 
 to remove this mass. 
 You think you'd be okay with that? 
 What the hell do you think I'm here for? 
 The donor heart is on its way, 
 so we need to start 
 prepping you for surgery. 
 I see you brought in reinforcements. 
 Hi. I'm Dr. Danni Powell. 
 Dr. Powell's one of our new residents. 
 This is her first day. 
 - Oh, and she's assisting? 
 - Yes. 
 I don't want a first year 
 on her first day 
 in on my husband's heart transplant. 
 You're a surgeon yourself. 
 You are aware 
 the only way residents learn 
 difficult surgeries 
 is by participating in them. 
 Yes, and I'm also aware that 
 residencies last five years, 
 so there's no reason 
 she needs to do this day one. 
 Honey, it's okay. 
 I'm sure Dr. Murphy 
 knows what he's doing. 
 Mm. 
 It's gonna be fine. 
 How can I be more worried than you? 
 You're smarter. 
 It's part of why I love you. 
 And hopefully my new heart will, too. 
 It definitely won't change that. 
 Can you hear me? 
 Code Blue! I need a cart! 
 Aah! 
 I've been looking for you. 
 I have a patient in the ER 
 who needs a mass removed from his neck. 
 I need an attending for Allen and Perez. 
 Okay. Uh, I'm pretty swamped. 
 Well, obviously, I wasn't 
 expecting you to do it, 
 but Murphy's on a transplant, 
 Park's busy decorating his office... 
 ""Obviously""? Why wouldn't I do it? 
 I just... Andrews said... 
 Surgeries are still done 
 with our hands, right? 
 The only thing that should be obvious 
 is that I'm not on call, but Park is, 
 so get over your stupid 
 breakup drama and go talk to him. 
 So, I'll reschedule your   :  ? 
 I can fit it in. 
 Didn't you want to make sure 
 you had the funding confirmed first? 
 Good point. 
 I will be doing 
 Mr. Persiko's hernia repair. 
 Audrey, I'm amazed 
 by your courage and fortitude, 
 and I will do everything in my 
 power to assist in your return. 
 But that might not include surgeries. 
 I have pretty much lived 
 at physical therapy 
 the last three months. 
 I have practiced extensively 
 in a custom chair that holds me upright 
 so that I can see and reach 
 the entire surgical field. 
 You know practicing in PT 
 is not the same as working in an OR. 
 And your office is not the same 
 as a courtroom, 
 so I won't bore you 
 with my rights under the ADA. 
 I can do all the duties 
 of chief surgeon. 
 Okay. 
 But I'm joining you on Persiko. 
 There is no reason 
 the president and chief surgeon 
 need to tag team a hernia repair. 
 Yes, there is. 
 Heparinization complete. 
 Bypass initiated. 
 Cross clamping the aorta. 
 And tighten the caval snares. 
 Dr. Powell, prep the donor organ. 
 Check the atrial septum. 
 Make sure there's 
 no patent foramen ovale. 
 Looks good. 
 The mitral, pulmonic, 
 and aortic valves also good. 
 Thank you. 
 I will transect the superior vena cava 
 while you divide the aorta 
 and pulmonary arteries. 
 Are you serious? 
 That's the most difficult part. 
 Are you confident you can handle it? 
 Definitely. 
 Then so am I.

 Wait, hold on. 
 The donor heart has a floppy tricuspid. 
 There was no evidence to suggest 
 severe tricuspid insufficiency 
 on the donor's echocardiogram. 
 The valve is damaged. 
 That must've happened during 
 the organ recovery surgery. 
 We can't replace one 
 damaged heart with another. 
 It took three months to get this one. 
 He won't last three more. 
 Aborting now and putting him on ECMO 
 would move him 
 to the top of the wait list. 
 We should be able to find 
 a new one in a few days, 
 a week at most. 
 You really want to take that risk? 
 It's not her decision. It's mine. 
 Abort the surgery. 
 We need to find a better heart. 
 We had to abort the transplant. 
 The damage was too severe. 
 We placed him on ECMO 
 and closed his chest. 
 He's being transferred to ICU 
 while we wait for a new donor. 
 You made that decision 
 without even consulting me? 
 It was surgical judgment. 
 And I'm a surgeon. 
 Not at this hospital. 
 Here, you're just the patient's wife. 
 ""Just""? My husband's life 
 is in your hands. 
 I have every right to ask questions. 
 Excuse me, Dr. Hall, 
 may I ask you something? 
 What? 
 I understand that you're upset 
 and frightened, 
 and you may disagree with our 
 decision to abort the transplant. 
 But we are gonna do everything 
 in our power 
 to find a new heart. 
 Is there any way that we can help you? 
 Any pre-op echo or operative 
 reports that you'd like to see? 
 Is there anyone else 
 that you'd like to talk to? 
 Can I see him? 
 Absolutely. 
 As soon as he's stable in the ICU, 
 we'll have a nurse bring you in. 
 Anything else that we can get for you? 
 Any food or a coffee? 
 Um, no. 
 Thank you. 
 So, what kind of stuff 
 do you like to collect? 
 I collect Egyptian pottery. 
 I got obsessed with King Tut 
 in elementary school. 
 I know. My friends all think 
 it's very odd, too. 
 Uh, I collect electronics, mostly. 
 Hi-fi stereo, computers, TVs. 
 All people care about now 
 is the next shiny thing. 
 Use it once, toss it in the trash. 
 You go to flea markets or garage sales? 
 Mm. They try to rip you off there. 
 I can shop and compare a 
 hundred different places online, 
 select what I want, have it 
 delivered right to my door. 
 It's just nice to go out sometimes. 
 I'm not a hermit or a hoarder. 
 No one's calling you that. 
 Everyone calls me that. 
 Just do your damn test. 
 Remove the thing, 
 and I can get out of here. 
 Okay. 
 Let me help you. 
 No, I can do it. 
 I know, but you've never had a problem 
 asking me to scratch your nose 
 during surgery. 
 Thanks. 
 This thing... 
 I feel slow and awkward. 
 You're like Ripley in Aliens. 
 A total badass. 
 I'm sorry. 
 You didn't do anything. 
 I wish I was as strong as you. 
 I can't sleep. Still have nightmares. 
 You're stronger than me. 
 I'm just a better poker player. 
 Your bedside manner is impressive. 
 I spent two years in Afghanistan, 
 so had plenty of practice 
 de-escalating conflict. 
 What about a biventricular 
 assist device? 
 Could extend the function 
 of his current heart. 
 Well, that's pretty short-term. 
 I was actually thinking... 
 Okay, he isn't oxygenating 
 sufficiently despite the ECMO, 
 and he's bleeding 
 from his cannula sites. 
 Have you considered a CARMAT? 
 We looked into 
 artificial hearts weeks ago. 
 He is not a candidate. 
 I shouldn't have aborted the transplant. 
 What about a xenotransplant? 
 I was just reading a study 
 about the use of pig hearts. 
 That's not an option. 
 Why not? 
 The most recent patient 
 lasted two months, 
 which is longer than 
 ECMO will keep him alive. 
 Because it's immoral. 
 Animals aren't surgical devices. 
 They are living beings who have 
 a right to self-determination. 
 Well, so was the guy whose 
 heart we just threw in the trash 
 a few hours ago. 
 That man made a free choice 
 to have his heart removed 
 after he died. 
 No one ex*cuted him 
 so they could take it. 
 We execute millions of pigs 
 every day for food, 
 and saving a human life 
 is more important. 
 k*lling animals for food 
 or for medicine is wrong. 
 I won't do it. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Powell, you have no choice. 
 Refusing to comply 
 with an attending's decision 
 would be grounds for termination. 
 Everything I've ever done 
 has been my choice. 
 So, you can fire me if you want to, 
 but I won't participate 
 in a xenotransplant. 
 Mm. 
 So, what are we doing? 
 As long as his wife consents, 
 xenotransplant. 
 Right. I will be here if you 
 need me for another patient. 
 Cut. 
 Can you loosen the top strap so 
 that I can lean forward a bit more? 
 And someone get her brow. 
 Thank you. 
 Okay. That should be good. 
 -  vicryl sutures. 
 Yeah. 
 - You need help? You want me to... 
 - No. I got this. 
 I got it. 
 It's okay. 
 This is a damn hernia repair. 
 I should be able to do it in my sleep. 
 Metz scissors. 
 You okay? 
 No. Take over. 
 Metz. 
 The mass has completely grown 
 into the larynx. 
 With possible bilateral involvement. 
 We should still be able to excise 
 without doing any more damage 
 to his voice. 
 I-I don't think the patient 
 cares about his voice. 
 He's not interested 
 in talking to anyone. 
 Or he just likes solitude. 
 I used to spend every summer alone 
 in the cab of a combine, and I loved it. 
 So, Mister-Already- 
 Knows-Every-Nurse-By-Name is a lone wolf? 
 I don't buy it. 
 Our lone wolf 
 has refused a psych consult, 
 so we should focus 
 on what we can actually fix. 
 - I agree. 
 - Then let me finish. 
 We need a laryngoscopy 
 to assess the compression 
 from the mass on his vocal cords. 
 I disagree. Better to do a needle 
 aspiration to assess malignancy. 
 He's my patient. Laryngoscopy. 
 But I'm the attending. 
 Needle aspiration. 
 We could do both. 
 Fine. 
 Sure. 
 The chief of surgery is responsible 
 for a lot more than just cutting. 
 I'm not giving up just because 
 I failed on my first try. 
 That wasn't what I was suggesting. 
 I'm just... 
 impatient. 
 I screwed up, which could've 
 endangered a patient. 
 You should be pissed off at me, 
 not giving me a damn pep talk. 
 Do I have the power to fire residents? 
 Yes. 
 I have a heart transplant patient 
 who is rapidly deteriorating... 
 Stop. You're now an attending. 
 You need to learn how to make 
 tough decisions on your own. 
 - Good job. 
 - Mm. 
 Now breathe. 
 Two-minute rest and we'll do one more. 
 Hey. 
 What are you doing here? 
 Oh, looking for a heating pad. 
 Or is it ice? I never know which one. 
 Ah, nobody does. 
 Judging from your walk, 
 I'd say you need a lot more than that. 
 She's right. And the real 
 problem's not your back. 
 It's your shoulders. 
 Your posture's all slumped. 
 I see that a lot in my older clients. 
 Oh. Well, thank you. 
 I fell into a trench during World w*r I. 
 I'm gonna get you a bolster. 
 How you doing? 
 Other than having to tap out 
 of a hernia repair? 
 Fantastic. 
 Standing's a lot harder than it looks. 
 So don't. 
 Do the surgery from your chair. 
 Well, unlike Murphy, 
 I have to be over the patient 
 to see inside. 
 So lower the patient. 
 That would throw a bunch 
 of things out of sync, 
 the staff, the table. 
 You're the chief. 
 Let them sync up with you, Chief. 
 The doctor's password is irrelevant. 
 The patients have their own 
 separate login ID. 
 You say irrelevant, 
 yet the patients can't log in. 
 They have to reset their 
 password every time they try. 
 Damn it. 
 I need some advice. 
 And I need an epidural. 
 And I need a new tech. 
 This guy's coding is a total mess. 
 I'm doing a xenotransplant, 
 but my new resident 
 refuses to participate. 
 She think it's immoral. 
 Dr. Andrews said 
 I have the power to fire her, 
 but I am not sure if I should. 
 Mm, if she's this defiant on day one, 
 it's only gonna get worse. 
 You have been defiant 
 to your attendings, right? 
 Surgery you did on Lim as an example. 
 That's different. 
 My decision 
 in Dr. Lim's surgery was right. 
 Dr. Powell, clearly wrong. 
 Your decision left her paralyzed. 
 He's not here to discuss Lim. 
 Your newbie is trouble 
 in all caps. Fire her. 
 I'd like to remind you 
 it's her first day. 
 It's also your first day. 
 Take a minute, think about it. 
 Thank you for your help. 
 You have much more leadership 
 experience than Lea does. 
 But I trust her more. 
 I'm going to fire Dr. Powell. 
 It's a pig. 
 It's a life. 
 Animals feel pain and fear. 
 They have emotions, just like humans. 
 Every drug we take 
 gets tested on animals first. 
 Are you against that too? 
 Call me a hypocrite, 
 but I believe that there is a 
 difference between a rat and a pig. 
 And as soon as the tech advances, 
 we should stop using rats, too. 
 Didn't you fight in a w*r? 
 You're okay 
 with k*lling for your country, 
 but won't sacrifice a pig 
 for your patient? 
 I was never okay with k*lling. 
 And only somebody who's never 
 been in the military 
 or known somebody who has been 
 would say something so idiotic. 
 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... 
 I need to speak with Dr. Powell. 
 The pig heart's here. We need to go. 
 We will finish this later. 
 Pull it back a little. 
 You went past the cords. 
 Wish there was a way 
 we could reach this guy. 
 At least get him to go outside 
 and stop trying to fill his loneliness 
 with electronic junk. 
 When my grandma died, 
 I saved her sweaters 
 because they smelled 
 like her pipe tobacco. 
 That's... interesting, 
 on a number of levels. 
 But your grandma's sweaters 
 are obviously different 
 than a stack of broken TVs 
 and receivers. 
 And you're handsome... enough. 
 You don't need to go on about 
 how much you love your grandma. 
 Already flirting. 
 He's only been here a few hours. 
 Have you at least finished 
 the scope first? 
 Finishing up. 
 I'll export the images to his chart. 
 And we were definitely not flirting. 
 Absolutely not. 
 I usually wait till the second 
 day on the job for that. 
 Needle nose. 
 Oh. 
 I always thought the needle nose 
 was the unsung hero of the toolbox. 
 Got it. 
 Awesome. 
 Actually, not awesome. 
 Even with all the covers off, 
 your knees won't fit under. 
 Damn it. 
 What if you took the motor out totally? 
 OR nurses can manually raise 
 and lower the table without the motor. 
 It's not the motor. It's the frame, 
 which is welded to the table. 
 Which means I'm screwed. 
 We can figure this out. 
 I gotta go. 
 Thanks for your efforts, 
 but this isn't happening. 
 - Where is the cooler? 
 - Cooler? 
 We thought you were bringing the heart. 
 I am. 
 We've found that patient 
 outcomes were much better 
 if the heart remained in vivo 
 until the last possible moment. 
 Sign here, please. 
 For specimen A     ? 
 We're not supposed 
 to name the specimens, 
 but we call him Wilbur. 
 Okay. 
 Come along, Wilbur. 
 We need a pre-op ECHO. 
 How? He's covered in hair. 
 How do you think? 
 Is it okay? They want to see him. 
 I'm sorry. We have to 
 prep him for surgery. 
 It is okay. 
 You can do that while they pet him. 
 Why does he need an operation? 
 Well, he is giving his heart 
 to another one of our patients. 
 But how will he live 
 if he gives his heart away? 
 No. 
 He can't. 
 He is going to die. 
 Mm. 
 Dr. Lim. 
 Dr. Lim. 
 - This better be fast. 
 - It will be. 
 I thought I should let you know 
 that I am firing Dr. Powell. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay. 
 Uh, mind if I ask why? 
 Oh. 
 She refused to participate 
 in the xenotransplant. 
 She thinks using animals for medical 
 procedures or research is immoral. 
 That's an odd opinion for someone 
 who wants a career in medicine. 
 But it's not your job as an attending 
 to weed out the bad residents. 
 It's to mentor and mold them into... 
 It's okay. 
 Wilbur is very friendly. 
 Good talk. I gotta go. 
 We finally figured out 
 how to lower the light. 
 Still haven't solved the table issue. 
 I have. Scrap the whole thing. 
 And do surgery sitting on the floor? 
 No. On a sturdy, stainless-steel 
 table that sits on four legs 
 instead of a bulky pedestal. 
 Like they have at my butcher shop. 
 And in our morgue. 
 Your beliefs are misguided 
 and very wrong. 
 Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim confirmed 
 that your insubordination 
 is just cause for termination. 
 I'm sorry you feel that way. 
 But I understand. 
 I'll clean out my locker. 
 You don't have to do that. 
 My job is to mentor and teach 
 you how to be a good doctor. 
 So I want you to watch the 
 xenotransplant from the OR gallery. 
 Just because you think it's immoral 
 doesn't mean you shouldn't 
 learn how it's done. 
 Are you willing to do that? 
 Yeah. Yes. 
 Good. 
 You can go now. 
 There's a lot of blood 
 from the tumor surface. 
 I need gauze. 
 It's not stopping. 
 You need to cut off 
 the tumor blood supply. 
 Thank you, Dr. Reznick. 
 Actually, I think the bleeding 
 might be coming 
 from the superior laryngeal artery. 
 Adding additional clamp and a silk tie. 
 The bleeding stopped. 
 Good catch. 
 Thanks. 
 Looks like you're 
 more than just a pretty face. 
 My grandma, who I loved 
 and cherished, would agree. 
 There's a minor tear in 
 the inferior epigastric artery. 
 No, I've got this. 
 I need to get more light 
 and a ten blade. 
 I'll open over the entry site. 
 Thank you. 
 Come on. Where are you? 
 There it is. 
 Bipolar forceps. 
 And... we're back on track. 
 Nice work. 
 It's kind of a big deal. 
 Maybe you want to say something? 
 Mm. Why? 
 Never mind. 
 You're our hero, Wilbur. 
 Ten blade. 
 Sternal saw. 
 Oh. 
 This is harder 
 than I thought it would be. 
 - You want me to do it? 
 - No. I am the attending. 
 I will do it. 
 Okay. 
 Stop! 
 Motorcyclist just declared 
 brain dead in the ER. 
 He's a match, and his family consented. 
 Heart's on the way. 
 Oh. 
 Oh. That felt inappropriate. 
 It was. 
 We need to close Wilbur chest 
 and waking him up. 
 Your surgery was very successful, 
 and, thankfully, not innovative at all. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 Thanks to Dr. Murphy. 
 It was a team effort. 
 Except for Dr. Powell. 
 Ah. 
 I thought I was supposed to rest. 
 Movement post-surgery helps 
 the blood flow and recovery. 
 What's a pig doing in here? 
 His name's Wilbur. 
 He was gonna donate his heart, 
 but turns out they didn't need him. 
 Want to meet him? He's super nice. 
 Pigs are actually 
 one of the smartest animals. 
 I grew up on a farm. 
 We once had a pig 
 who could do long division. 
 Mm. 
 What's gonna happen to him now? 
 He'll have to be euthanized. 
 He's been genetically modified. 
 Can't be around other pigs. 
 Use you once 
 and throw you away. 
 You are brilliant. 
 - It worked? 
 - Perfectly. 
 Wilbur's got a new parent, 
 and Jeremiah's got a reason to 
 step outside at least twice a day. 
 Mm. 
 I'm impressed. Seriously. 
 You should be. Because I'm awesome. 
 Jeremiah just needed a 
 little push in the right direction. 
 I'm glad you didn't just make a snap 
 judgment based on his appearance. 
 I thought I knew your type. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Mm. 
 Wanna grab a drink, 
 let me make it up to you? 
 We're good. 
 And I'm beat. 
 Gonna go home, do some restorative yoga, 
 and, uh, hit the hay. 
 Yeah, me too. 
 No, I'm kidding. 
 I'm gonna drink. 
 But mad respect. 
 Namaste. 
 So, he wasn't your type, but now he is? 
 - I never said that. 
 - Ooh. 
 You absolutely said it. 
 You just used your flirty voice. 
 You were like, ""Mad respect. Namaste."" 
 Can we continue this argument 
 over Negronis? 
 I paid last time. 
 I paid last time. 
 - No, I paid last time. 
 - Oh, really? 
 Yeah, 'cause I had to leave 
 the tip, too. 
 Kick. 
 Toes up. 
 Good. 
 Down. 
 How was the appy? 
 Fine. 
 Fine, but what? 
 I'll, uh, get you set up 
 with the E-stim. 
 I feel like a racehorse that's 
 been relegated to the carousel. 
 I used to tell people 
 that it took me two years 
 to get back to being 
 the surgeon that I was, 
 you know, before 
 the brain cancer and all that. 
 I lied. 
 I never got back to being 
 the surgeon I was. 
 You're never going to be 
 the doctor you were. 
 That's a fact. 
 But you have no idea 
 the doctor you're gonna become. 
 And I am here for you. 
 Anytime. 
 Thanks. 
 I've been told you two have 
 been sniping at each other. 
 - No, we... 
 - This is not a conversation. 
 You two need to sort your stuff out, 
 because I don't ever want 
 to have to deal with it again. 
 - Yes. 
 - It won't happen again. 
 Good. 
 So, how was your first day? 
 Tequila stat! 
 Are we commiserating or celebrating? 
 We are definitely celebrating. 
 Ugh. 
 Come on! 
 - Hey. Tough day? 
 - Oh. 
 I know you said you don't want any... 
 No, I... I'm... I can do this. 
 Thank you. 
 Ah! 
 Come on! 
 You okay? 
 No, I am not okay. 
 I'm so sick of this chair. 
 I'm sick of having to drive 
 with my hands. 
 I'm sick of not being able to get around 
 because there are stairs everywhere. 
 And I hate that my body 
 won't do what I want. 
 I hate having to train 
 like an Olympic gymnast 
 just so I can get off the damn toilet. 
 And I hate Shaun Murphy. 
 This is all his fault."
gdoc_6_3,6470478,6,3,"I love... 
 our married people plates 
 so much. Don't you? 
 They have a pleasant heft

 No. Hmm. 
 You finished? 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We should have a dinner party. 
 We have six smooth, beautiful 
 married people plates. 
 We can invite Frank and Morgan. 
 That sounds not fun and like we 
 might have fewer plates by the end. 
 What about Jordan and Asher? 
 That could be fun. 
 But if we invite Asher and not Jerome, 
 is that offensive? 
 Okay, best idea yet, 
 skip the dinner party, skip the 
 awkwardness, see our friends at work. 
 I'll be ready in a minute. 
 It will be closer 
 to four minutes, possibly five. 
 Both are acceptable. 
 [DR. LIM] I need 
 the M&M report on my surgery. 
 And by your surgery, you mean? 
 The one Shaun performed on me. 
 The committee found no evidence 
 that Shaun did anything wrong. 
 Inconclusive. 
 They decided the evidence 
 was inconclusive. 
 I would like to do my own review. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Do you really think 
 you can be impartial, 
 or will you just be searching 
 for a reason to punish Shaun? 
 I don't know why I would, 
 unless something in the report 
 suggests Dr. Murphy made a mistake. 
 I'll email you the file.

 Cady, you're safe. I'm Dr. Park.

 We were on our way

 She's so worked up

 She hasn't even recognized us

 No, no, no. Don't talk to them! 
 - They're liars! 
 - Cady, Cady, Cady, please hold still. 
 You... You can't trust them. 
 Please, please, Dr. Park.

 This is Julianne. 
 She fractured her ankle

 The tibiotalar joint may be an issue. 
 I got dizzy from hypoglycemia. 
 Must've mistimed my insulin. 
 No idea how that happened. 
 Is it time to check my blood sugar? 
 No, not yet. 
 Oh, that is a very shiny wedding ring. 
 How long has it been, Dr. Murphy? 
 Lea and I have been married 
 for three months

 Wet cement year. Oh. 
 I wish I met more 
 of my clients at that stage.

 Full plantar and dorsiflexion

 The first year of marriage is crucial 
 for cultivating good patterns 
 and weeding out bad ones 
 before they can harden into habits 
 that will define 
 your entire relationship. 
 What habits define your marriage? 
 I'm afraid all our habits 
 are in the past. 
 My husband died recently. 
 I'm so sorry for your loss. 
 How long has he been gone? 
 A little over five months. 
 Is it time to check my blood sugar? 
 You asked her about a minute ago. 
 - It was longer than that. 
 - No, it wasn't. 
 And I know, from your podcast, 
 your husband died several years ago. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You need surgery on your ankle, 
 but we should MRI your brain. 
 We've repaired the laceration 
 to her radial artery, 
 but there's still a decision to be made 
 on treating her wrist fracture. 
 There's a choice between 
 external or internal fixation. 
 The external fixator involves 
 attaching a metal frame 
 to her forearm and hand. 
 It requires a longer stay 
 and frequent adjustments 
 for eight to twelve weeks. 
 Internal gets Cady 
 out of the hospital sooner, 
 but has a high risk of complications, 
 like nerve damage or infection. 
 Uh, I don't like the sound 
 of those complications. 
 The treatment center will only 
 hold her spot for a week. 
 What happens if they can't 
 handle those adjustments? 
 I can reach out to them. 
 I-I-I'm not certain about sending Cady 
 away for treatment at this point. 
 She nearly k*lled herself 
 rather than go to that place. 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 - She's a danger to herself. 
 She's a danger to others. 
 She needs more help 
 than we can give her. 
 We'll leave you two alone to talk. 
 As Cady's mother, it's my decision. 
 Moira! 
 I love Cady like a daughter. 
 But if she comes home... 
 I'm not sure I can. 
 [GLOOMY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Please do the external fixator. 
 Thank you, doctors. 
 [ELEVATOR CHIMES] 
 I gave Lim a copy

 She was very insistent. 
 She come see you? 
 Not yet. 
 - Uh, I'll clear out. 
 - Please stay. 
 I am interested 
 in your opinion, as well. 
 Must be a real doozy of a case 
 if you called all of us, 
 the chief included. 
 I am treating a   -year-old woman 
 with a fractured ankle 
 and a distorted sense of time. 
 It is too soon to tell if it is a doozy. 
 Now, we can begin. 
 Please describe all of the 
 bad habits that developed 
 during the first year of your 
 respective failed marriages. 
 Or good habits, if you had any. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 So, we're all here because... 
 As an attending, 
 I no longer have time to talk 
 to you all individually, 
 so, I called a meeting 
 of the divorced. 
 Dr. Glassman, you have 
 the most failed marriages. 
 Park's split-up was much more recent. 
 You go first. 
 Well, that was a break-up, 
 not a divorce. 
 You and Dr. Reznick 
 seemed pretty serious. 
 Um, don't get involved 
 with a pathologically ambitious 
 narcissist and, uh... 
 be as emotionally open as possible, 
 which you're already great at. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] 
 And that goes for everything. 
 Nothing is too small to discuss. 
 Except for the infinite number 
 of differences of opinion. 
 And how do you know 
 which ones don't matter? 
 Dr. Murphy, if you have 
 concerns about your marriage, 
 talk to your wife. 
 Meeting adjourned. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC CONTINUES] 
 Julianne's brain MRI. 
 Check out the parietal lobe. 
 Dr. Andrews! 
 This case may be a doozy after all. 
 You have a grade   oligodendroglioma 
 centered in your parietal lobe. 
 It's disturbing your precuneus region. 
 May I? 
 Looked at a lot of brains during 
 my doctoral psych program. 
 It's close to the motor 
 and primary sensory cortex. 
 We will need to map out 
 the critical structures of your brain 
 to determine a surgical approach. 
 There are risks, 
 but if we can get all of it, 
 the prognosis is excellent. 
 Or we could try to shrink the tumor 
 with chemo and radiation, 
 but there's an increased chance 
 the tumor will progress 
 to a grade   glioma. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I want the surgery. 
 My life's work has been 
 to help people find 
 what my husband and I had. 
 I'm not done yet. [CHUCKLES] 
 That is... very good to hear. 
 This transcranial magnetic stimulation 
 will pinpoint the pathways 
 of your motor cortex 
 and help us resect your brain tumor. 
 And this is my wife, Lea. 
 - Hey. 
 - Lea, met Julianne. 
 She is a marriage therapist 
 and told me to be careful 
 of the habits we set. 
 Great to meet you, 
 but under the circumstances... 
 Chatting with you two is much better 
 than contemplating those 
 circumstances. [CHUCKLES] 
 Stay. 
 I made a list of small habits 
 that could become larger problems. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 ""Snoring, minor tardiness."" 
 - Is that supposed to happen? 
 - Yes. 
 A disconcerting tolerance for dust. 
 - These are all my habits. 
 - Yes. 
 Do I have habits 
 you would like me to change? 
 At this point, 
 you better just say it, hmm? 
 The dishes. 
 You take them out of the dishwasher 
 and rerinse them 
 after I've already done it. 
 Because you are doing it wrong. 
 - [GROANS] 
 - Try to hold still. 
 We just need to make sure that your 
 wound's clean for surgery tomorrow. 
 My head hurts. I-I need to sit up. 
 Hey. 
 Please, just let me see my mom. 
 She wouldn't like 
 what you're doing to me. 
 We're all trying 
 to help you feel better. 
 You hungry? 
 Paul went to get you some food. 
 I want to go home. 
 Okay, wound looks good. 
 - Now, let's pack it with gauze. 
 - [MOANS] 
 We can give her something 
 to try to help her relax. 
 No. No more poison. 
 She doesn't need to be drugged. 
 She's uncomfortable. 
 [GROANS] 
 Please, just let her out. 
 I can't. I'm sorry. 
 [GROANS] 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 On all three fundamentals, 
 water temperature, choice of equipment, 
 and application of force, 
 your technique is lacking. 
 Shaun, we have a dishwasher. 
 This is just a preliminary rinse. 
 Shaun, um, instead 
 of offering a critique, 
 try stating a positive need. 
 You know, something like, ""I wish 
 the situation was more like this..."" 
 I wish the situation was more like 
 Lea knew how to wash the dishes. 
 - [BEEP] 
 - We're done with the mapping. 
 Lea, do you enjoy doing the dishes? 
 Does anyone? 
 [SCOFFING] I do. 
 Then forget finding 
 common ground on this, huh? 
 Divide and conquer. 
 [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 He went three for four, 
 two doubles, three RBIs, 
 and struck out the side! 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 Well, wait until he's 
 and can throw a curve. 
 Oh, I-I think I can get back from here. 
 Oh, please. I'm enjoying the company. 
 Ohh! 
 You're so sweet. [LAUGHS] 
 - I feel nothing. Leave me alone. 
 - Fine. 
 [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 What have you two been fighting about? 
 - Everything. 
 - Just little stuff. 
 Yeah, because you're so crabby. 
 Because you're so distracted. 
 It's always like this 
 when I'm on night shifts. 
 Why do you think night shifts 
 are a problem? 
 We have less time together 
 to hang out and... 
 Sex! There's no sex. 
 Because he's too tired 
 when he gets home. 
 Hmm. 
 Why do you have to wait 
 until he gets home? 
 Five more on this side, then switch. 
 I'm going to get a heat pad. 
 You wanted to do a hemihepatectomy, 
 but Shaun changed your surgical plan. 
 Is that right? 
 Would you like me to put my 
 hand on a Bible, counselor? 
 I thought removing a lobe 
 was the safest choice. 
 After I left, the parameters changed. 
 Shaun adjusted. 
 A resident overruled your judgment, 
 without bothering to consult you, 
 and you were fine with that? 
 That resident was days away 
 from becoming an attending, 
 and he did exactly 
 what you trained him to do: 
 he made a tough decision, a hard call, 
 with limited data. 
 Would you have made that call? 
 When I got back, 
 I evaluated the progress, 
 and I decided 
 that it was safe to continue. 
 It was safe? 
 Or you had no choice? 
 Clearly, you read the report. 
 You tell me. 
 You asked why 
 no one had come to get you. 
 If you were fine with Shaun's call, 
 why would you care? 
 I was worried about you. 
 Thank you. 
 But if you were fine with the call, 
 why would you care? 
 - I got angry. 
 - You didn't say angry in the M&M. 
 You said, ""Concerned."" 
 You're slicing the salami 
 pretty thin right now. 
 Why not just say you were angry? 
 My precise emotional state 
 is not medically relevant. 
 Unless you were angry 
 because Shaun made a bad call. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Shaun saved your life. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 What? [SCOFFS] 
 Folding the shirt in thirds 
 allows them to be stored vertically. 
 Sure, but I'd rather... 
 Storing them vertically saves space 
 and makes them easier to find. 
 Well, why don't you fold the shirts? 
 That is an excellent idea. 
 [CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY] 
 Good night. 
 Good night. 
 [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Not a bad way to spend a dinner break. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I'm going to go crash for a 
 while before my call starts. 
 Okay. 
 - Hey, we need Dr. Park or security. 
 - What's wrong? 
 I-I went home to get 
 a change of clothes... 
 [MOIRA] I must've fallen asleep. 
 She's gone. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Cady couldn't sleep with, 
 with the restraints. 
 She was upset and uncomfortable. 
 I took them off. 
 I asked her to. It's my fault. 
 It's not your job 
 to enforce hospital protocol. 
 Security's been alerted. 
 They're working top-down. 
 You guys cover the east wing. 
 We'll take the west. 
 Start down that hall. 
 I'll check the patient rooms. 
 [SHAUN] Resecting the final 
 aspect of the tumor. 
 Lea and I took Julianne's advice 
 and divided and conquered last night. 
 I started with the dishes and 
 then moved on to folding laundry. 
 More irrigation. 
 [ASHER] And Lea, what did she conquer? 
 I was very open and pointed out 
 her shirt-folding errors, 
 and then she went to bed. 
 It was quite successful. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ASHER] You sure about that? 
 - Did she... kiss you good night? 
 - Yes. 
 - Cheek or lips? 
 - Cheek. 
 I got all of the tumor. 
 Remove the patties and line 
 the resection bed with Fibrillar. 
 You think maybe 
 it was not a success with Lea? 
 - Sounds like maybe... 
 - You bombed. 
 [ALARM BEEPS, BLARES] 
 She's in V-tach. 
 No carotid pulse. 
 No detectable BP on the art line. 
 [SHAUN] Check the brain 
 for herniation or hematoma. 
 [ASHER] No bleeding or signs of edema... 
 No increased ICP. Maybe she threw a PE? 
 Her EKG was normal. Give one 
 milligram of epi and stand by with more. 
 Clear! 
 [BEEP, THUD] 
 [BEEPING] 
 [BLARING STOPS] 
 [BEEPING] 
 Her brain looked good. 
 Her vitals were stable. 
 [ASHER] No history of heart disease. 
 Could be an adverse reaction 
 to the anesthesia? 
 Do an echo, send trops, 
 and put her on telemetry 
 to rule out cardiac issues.

 It's lovely.

 we walk back to your room? 
 Do I have to lie down? 
 It makes my head hurt. 
 You can sit up in your bed. 
 Okay. Come on. 
 Attagirl. 
 [SERENE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Cady, do your feet hurt? 
 No. They're just sticky. 
 They put glue on them 
 to keep me from running. 
 ♪ But I see your true colors 
 Shining through... ♪ 
 - We need to get a head CT. 
 - Yeah. 
 ♪ I see your true ♪ 
 The ventricular enlargement, 
 that's fluid built up inside her brain. 
 Cady has hydrocephalus. 
 It explains a lot of her symptoms, 
 shuffling her feet, 
 the headaches when she lies down, and... 
 possibly, her psychiatric issues. 
 Cady might not be bipolar? 
 We'll know more once we insert a shunt 
 and drain the fluid from her brain. 
 I noticed the shuffling a year ago. 
 I-I didn't even mention it 
 to the doctor. 
 I just thought it was 
 another... delusion. 
 All the doctors we brought her to, 
 they all missed it. 
 We almost locked her up. 
 She could've died in there. 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We removed all of the tumor. 
 The surgery was successful, although... 
 I died. 
 I saw you. 
 It was like I was out of my body. 
 I saw you doing compressions 
 and there were alarms going off. 
 And then I saw my husband 
 in these quick flashes. 
 He was waiting for me, somewhere. 
 Tell me what you saw. 
 There were vivid colors everywhere. 
 It was unlike anything I had ever seen. 
 But it felt like home. 
 What kind of colors? 
 I... can't describe them. 
 My husband was reaching out to me... 
 and I almost touched him. 
 Then you pulled me back. 
 You had a near-death experience. 
 Ah. 
 No. She had a symptom. 
 There is something else 
 wrong with your brain. 
 We need to find out what it is. 
 She didn't have 
 an out-of-body experience! 
 She accurately described us 
 trying to save her. 
 No, she described a code, 
 which only proves 
 that she watches 
 medical shows on television. 
 And the heaven that she told us about, 
 it's all recycled cliches... 
 the peace, nice colors, 
 your loved ones waiting. 
 And maybe those cliches exist 
 because that's what 
 the afterlife is like. 
 - You're a believer. 
 - Please be quiet! 
 Julianne must have a multifocal tumor, 
 most likely in her occipital lobe. 
 A tumor there could've caused a 
 subclinical, nonconvulsive seizure, 
 which would explain her 
 hallucination and cardiac arrest. 
 A tumor there would make sense. 
 Then where is it? 
 It must be hidden by the edema 
 from the previous tumor. 
 We need more images 
 at a higher resolution. 
 All right, I'll book the MRI 
 and get Julianne. 
 Oh, are you a one almighty God type 
 or more spiritual, but not religious? 
 I'm just asking for a friend.

 [MONITOR BEEPING, VENTILATOR HISSING] 
 You're off-target. 
 Position the catheter toward the 
 nasion and tragus skull landmarks. 
 If Cady hadn't wandered off, 
 we may have never noticed 
 the foot dragging. 
 A good outcome doesn't 
 cancel out a bad decision. 
 The chain of command 
 exists for a reason. 
 I'm in. 
 Attach the manometer 
 to check her brain pressure. 
 Oh, no. I'd guess about    centimeters. 
 Must've been building up for years. 
 The brain damage could be irreversible. 
 [DR. PARK] I'm gonna place the valve, 
 start draining fluid into the abdomen. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I got your text. Is everything okay? 
 Were you mad last night when 
 I took over folding the shirts? 
 Shaun, at some point we need to define 
 what qualifies as an important matter 
 that needs to be discussed 
 as soon as possible. 
 Yes. Okay. Were you mad? 
 I was frustrated. But I'm over it. 
 Why were you frustrated? 
 Didn't you want to know 
 the right way to do it? 
 There's no right way to do it, Shaun. 
 There's my way, there's your way, 
 and a thousand other ways. 
 And I don't need you to think 
 that my way is right. 
 Especially since your way 
 is fully research supported. 
 But knowing you think I'm wrong 
 about so many things, 
 sometimes it feels like 
 you're watching me 
 and holding a big sign that says, 
 ""You're doing everything wrong."" 
 That's why I was frustrated. 
 And I know you didn't mean it that way, 
 and I know it's important for you 
 to have things a certain way. 
 Because of my ASD. 
 I love your brain, Shaun. 
 And I really don't care 
 about laundry and dishes. 
 I'll find something else to be in 
 charge of like grocery shopping. 
 Maybe you could check 
 the apples better for bruises. 
 The store will not take them back. 
 Right. 
 There's something wrong 
 with Julianne's brain. 
 I don't see anything. 
 Me neither. 
 [DR. PARK] We'll know a lot more 
 about her prognosis when she wakes up. 
 For now, we're keeping her 
 under sedation 
 and giving mannitol to keep 
 her brain pressure down. 
 Well, whatever happens, 
 we'll get through it. 
 You're in for the long haul now? 
 You threatened to walk out on us. 
 I was upset. 
 I just... I was trying to do what 
 was best for her and for... for you. 
 By leaving us? 
 Your symptoms point to another 
 tumor in your occipital lobe. 
 No tablet this time? 
 The tumor doesn't show up on imaging, 
 but I know it is there. 
 We can see an irregular and distinct 
 pattern of edema in that region. 
 If the tumor's there, it will 
 very likely stop your heart again. 
 I've been dead before. 
 It was pretty great. 
 I don't want the surgery. 
 No, the bright colors you couldn't 
 describe, that's color agnosia. 
 Your husband being just out of reach, 
 that's optic ataxia. 
 You did not see Heaven. 
 You had a seizure caused by your tumor. 
 Dr. Murphy, 
 you and I are both cursed 
 with being very good at fixing things. 
 When Scott was alive, 
 I could have made a list of a hundred 
 ways 
 to improve my marriage, my husband. 
 But when I saw him again... 
 I couldn't think 
 of a single thing I'd change. 
 I just want to be with my husband again. 
 You will be. 
 Uh, I think 
 what you experienced was real. 
 What you saw, it's... 
 it's not going anywhere. 
 And there are still a lot of 
 people here who need your insight. 
 I know that matters to you 
 because even with a tumor... 
 Two brain tumors. 
 Two brain tumors and a broken ankle, 
 you still made a point of 
 helping half your medical team. 
 Eternity is a long time. 
 Your husband will be waiting 
 for you whenever you get there. 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 He better. 
 Let's see if you're right. 
 She's a GCS of eight, 
 has most of her brain stem reflexes. 
 But no signs that she's ready 
 to come off the vent. 
 She always took forever to wake up. 
 I saw Paul in the cafeteria just now 
 surrounded by empty coffee cups. 
 If you'd like some company... 
 No, I'm fine. Thank you, Doctor. 
 I used to be a lieutenant 
 on an aircraft carrier. 
 The first time I saw a plane land, 
 I thought for sure this sucker 
 is going to skid right off 
 the other end into the ocean. 
 I promise there's a point to this. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 But they never do. 
 Because the planes, 
 they have these tail hooks 
 that catch 
 on these giant, inch-thick steel wires. 
 These wires, they can stop 
 a   ,   -pound aircraft 
 traveling     miles per hour 
 in two seconds. 
 And they almost never break... 
 until they do. 
 One swung across the deck 
 and hit my leg, sent me flying. 
 I was in a coma for weeks. 
 My parents, they had to decide 
 whether or not to amputate my leg, 
 and they disagreed. 
 It got ugly. 
 But my mom won. 
 And I went to med school on one leg. 
 And my parents, they celebrated 
 years last month. 
 When a family member is sick, 
 everybody gets a pass. 
 Hi, there. 
 After Shaun committed to the 
 angioembolization, 
 my collateral vessels bled, 
 causing my blood pressure to bottom out. 
 - Audrey, it's late... 
 - That loss of BP 
 led to my cord ischemia, 
 which led to my paralysis. 
 - Do you agree? 
 - Yes, as I said in the report, yes. 
 The report is facts. It's just facts. 
 Audrey, what exactly 
 do you want from me? 
 I am sitting in this chair 
 because of that surgery. 
 And everybody here 
 seems completely fine with it. 
 Fine with Shaun's decision, 
 fine with him going rogue. 
 I'm not fine with it. 
 I'm not fine with it. 
 Well, 
 that is not what you said in the M&M. 
 What Shaun did was headstrong, 
 it was risky, 
 and it's not 
 what I would have done, okay? 
 But let's just be clear. 
 He didn't make a mistake, 
 he did what he thought was best, 
 and it shouldn't be a mark 
 on his career as a surgeon. 
 - That is not your decision. 
 - And I'm angry, okay? 
 I'm angry. So what? It's irrelevant. 
 I'm so angry I could scream. 
 It keeps me up every night. 
 What if Andrews didn't call me away? 
 What if I had come back 
 just five minutes sooner? 
 What if? What if? What if? 
 - Well, what would you have done? 
 - [SIGHS] 
 Come on, Aaron. 
 What would you have done? 
 Would you have told Shaun 
 to go back to the original plan? 
 Yes. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Thank you. 
 Because everything's fixed now? 
 Because you're gonna walk again soon? 
 Because you're with me. 
 Finally somebody sees my side 
 instead of Shaun's. 
 It's not either-or. 
 I'm not so sure. 
 There's just something sexy 
 about the closet. 
 Maybe it's the symbolism. 
 You know, like coming out of the closet. 
 - I get it. I just don't approve of it. 
 - Why? 
 From the coffee shop 
 that's on my way in. 
 Number two on your list of 
 top-ten food and beverage items 
 within walking distance of the hospital. 
 The almond croissant. 
 Thanks. I'll pay you back. 
 Don't you dare. I'll see you in surgery. 
 Oh. 
 Okay, I feel something. 
 A crush. 
 A massive, all-consuming, ""my 
 stomach rolls over when I see him"" crush 
 because he is gorgeous 
 and thoughtful and smart and apparently 
 eats carbs, and I'm only human. 
 - Happy now? 
 - Yeah. 
 Are you gonna eat that? 
 I'm so screwed. 
 Just a minute. Dr. Murphy. 
 Don't worry too much 
 about the wet cement. 
 It's clear how important your 
 wife and your marriage is to you. 
 Just keep letting Lea know that, 
 and you'll keep being a great husband.

 You lost a patient today, Dr. Murphy? 
 She seized on the table 
 before the first incision. 
 Autopsy confirmed she had a 
 high-grade occipital lobe tumor 
 which would have k*lled her 
 in three to six months. 
 Your advice was good. 
 I talked to Lea about habits

 appreciate when I wash the dishes 
 after she washes the dishes, 
 even though she is doing it wrong. 
 Shaun, I can't hear this. 
 [LOUDLY] Your advice was good. 
 I talked to Lea about... 
 I mean, I don't want to hear it. 
 I'm having complicated feelings 
 about my surgery. 
 - What you did. 
 - I saved your life. 
 This... 
 This is a struggle. 
 You put me here, 
 and I'm really angry about that. 
 As your boss, 
 I need to set my feelings aside, 
 be professional, and I will. 
 But that's all. 
 I don't want you to ask me

 So I shouldn't worry about it. 
 Your brother was pretty smart. 
 Oh. Yes, he was. 
 Oh, I have to go. 
 I'm meeting Dr. Glassman for pancakes. 
 Good morning. 
 I haven't seen you around lately. 
 Yeah, I've been really busy at work. 
 - Oh, I know the feeling. 
 - Mm. 
 That Murphy guy still 
 making your life miserable? 
 Actually, no. 
 We had a very... honest discussion. 
 I set some boundaries, 
 feel good about it. 
 - Nice. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 I bet that's a relief. 
 Sorry I was such a mess 
 in the garage last week. 
 Oh. It was nothing. 
 Not true, but thank you. 
 I owe you. 
 Actually, I could use a ride 
 to the airport tomorrow. 
 I have a  :   a.m. flight. 
 - Okay. Um... 
 - I'm kidding. 
 I was happy to help. 
 - Have a good one. 
 - You too. 
 That was nice. 
 For once, my complete 
 clumsiness actually paid off. 
 Might change your mind 
 when you get the cleaning bill. 
 It was worth every penny. 
 I'd gladly sacrifice another 
 shirt to do it all again. 
 Hopefully soon? 
 Or not. 
 Sorry. I was only in town 
 to finalize the sale 
 of our West Coast distributor. 
 And now that it's done... 
 Well, I've been looking for 
 an excuse to visit New York. 
 I would love that, 
 but I'm pretty sure my husband wouldn't. 
 Don't hate me. 
 We had fun. 
 We've got some powder burns 
 and a penetrating shrapnel wound. 
 Ooh. From playing airsoft? 
 I'm in a historical battle 
 reenactment club. 
 I thought some explosions would 
 make it more realistic and fun. 
 One of the fireworks went off 
 when I was setting it up. 
 It doesn't look too bad. 
 It was gushing blood. 
 It's bleeding. It's not gushing. 
 I spent a year as a Navy 
 corpsman in Afghanistan, 
 treated hundreds of shrapnel 
 wounds that actually were gushing. 
 You're gonna be fine. 
 - Can you move your arm? 
 - Oh. 
 Yeah. 
 Aah! Yeah. 
 A little. 
 No step-offs, good range of motion. 
 The humerus isn't fractured, 
 which means Dr. Powell is right. 
 You're going to be fine. 
 Irrigate with antibiotic saline and 
 get a CT to locate the fragments. 
 Page me to the OR 
 when he's prepped for surgery. 
 Yes. Will do. 
 Need help over here. 
 He's in and out of consciousness. 
 BP's in the toilet 
 from massive blood loss. 
 Damn. 
 Fluid resuscitation initiated en route. 
 - Shark bite? 
 - Speedboat. 
 Got run over on a predawn skinny-dip. 
 Luckily his girlfriend's 
 a former lifeguard, 
 got him to shore, applied a tourniquet. 
 What do we got? 
 An attending who's    minutes 
 late to his call shift. 
 Total amputation of the left lower 
 extremity at the tibiotalar joint. 
 - Speedboat propeller. 
 - Thank you. 
 See how easy and productive that was? 
 Oh, grumpy as well as late. 
 Must've been a rough night. 
 It was a great night, 
 and an even better morning, 
 not that it's any of your business. 
 - Oh, then why tell me? 
 - Because it bothers you. 
 What's weird is, this isn't much 
 different than when they were dating. 
 One of the many reasons 
 we're not anymore. 
 Transfuse four units PRBC 
 and stay four ahead. 
 - On it. 
 - It's a clean cut. 
 We got six to eight hours 
 max of ischemic time. 
 You're gonna try to reattach it? 
 I'm gonna do more than try. 
 And the proper term is ""replant."" 
 Call it whatever you want, 
 it's still a bad idea. 
 Lack of a sensate plantar surface 
 would make it likely 
 no better than a prosthetic. 
 I disagree, and seeing as 
 I'm the only attending 
 who's an actual surgeon, 
 I'll take it from here. 
 - Where's the foot? 
 - I assume at the bottom of the lake. 
 You mean the top. 
 Not unless he was 
 skinny-dipping with his shoes on. 
 - Bodies float. 
 - Severed feet sink. 
 Okay, wherever it is, 
 we need to find it fast. 
 Get police search and rescue 
 out there ASAP. 
 Good luck. 
 I'll call. 
 Increase fluid and blood resuscitation. 
 If we don't get his BP up, 
 finding his foot won't matter. 
 Vitals have stabilized. 
 He's opening his eyes. 
 I'm Dr. Park. 
 You're at St. Bonaventure Hospital. 
 Can you tell me your name? 
 Uh, Andy. 
 You know what city you're in? 
 San Jose. 
 Is Brittany here? 
 Your girlfriend couldn't ride 
 in the ambulance, 
 but the EMT said she was 
 gonna follow in her car. 
 She's not my girlfriend. 
 It was our first date. 
 She saved your life. 
 Sounds like a keeper. 
 How many stitches did I need? 
 She said the cut was pretty bad. 
 Andy, I'm sorry, but your left foot 
 was completely severed at the ankle. 
 What? 
 It didn't even hurt that much. 
 You were in hypovolemic shock, 
 nearly died from the blood loss. 
 We need to get you into an OR 
 to clean and debride the wound. 
 We'll leave it open for now, 
 and if we can find the foot, 
 we'll attempt to replant it. 
 What do you mean, if you can find it? 
 It's in the lake? 
 Search and rescue headed to the lake. 
 I want you guys out there, as well. 
 You need to start antibiotic irrigation 
 with pulse lavage as soon as it's found, 
 and then get it 
 in an organ transplant unit 
 and perfuse during transport. 
 We're on a clock. Every second counts. 
 That lake's huge. 
 You really think they're gonna find it? 
 Well, police divers find weapons 
 perps toss in the ocean all the time. 
 With metal detectors, 
 which obviously won't... 
 Go. 
 He's lucky. 
 Not even any occult fractures. 
 It still blows my mind 
 you fought in a w*r. 
 I wish that we could get a better view 
 of the recon images 
 at the level 
 of the mid to distal humerus. 
 Oh, we can. 
 Watch and learn, young Padawan. 
 Thanks. 
 That's... a big one. 
 What made you decide to enlist? 
 - Did you have family in the... 
 - I didn't enlist. 
 I went to the Naval Academy 
 and got an officer's commission 
 after graduation. 
 There's a brachial 
 artery pseudoaneurysm. 
 Looks like the only thing 
 stopping it from rupturing 
 is the shrapnel wedged 
 against the vessel wall. 
 That's... not good. 
 We have to get him to the OR. 
 - I'll page Dr. Murphy. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 What're you doing? 
 This lamp was in the wrong place. 
 It seemed fine to me. 
 You're not as easily distracted 
 by the environment as I am. 
 Well, I understand, but next time, 
 you mind checking with me 
 before you start rearranging furniture? 
 I think you'll like the lamps here. 
 That's not the point. 
 I have to get to the OR. 
 Park has more confidence 
 in the cops than I do. 
 There's no way 
 they're gonna find it in time. 
 I had a cousin who lost her engagement 
 ring in a Halloween corn maze. 
 A year later, the farmer 
 found it inside an ear of corn. 
 If you believe that, there's a Nigerian 
 prince I'd love to introduce you to. 
 - It's true. 
 - No, it's not. 
 The farmer found it the same day 
 she lost it, probably in the bathroom. 
 He figured he'd let the commotion 
 die down before he tried to sell it. 
 Then someone in his family got cancer or 
 something else 
 he needed the Lord's help with. 
 He couldn't very well pray 
 for divine intervention 
 with a hot diamond in his sock drawer. 
 You have a very fertile 
 and cynical imagination. 
 Thank you. 
 I've been listening to that 
 Ten Percent Happier podcast, 
 so I'm all about the positive vibes. 
 Our foot will be found. 
 I got    bucks says you're wrong. 
 Oh, come on, Mr. Positive, 
 you can't lose. 
 - It's a bet. 
 - Okay. 
 Stop being so dramatic. 
 You stop being so dramatic. 
 The next one is... is the top one. 
 Stop second dealing. 
 I don't want a pilonidal cyst. 
 I just had a guy with jock-itch 
 that was up to his belly button. 
 And I just had a guy with a plantar 
 wart infection who hasn't changed socks 
 since the Carter Administration. 
 The next one is the top one. 
 Take it. 
 Do you have a minute? 
 Yes. 
 I was just curious about how 
 your breakfast with Shaun went. 
 I canceled. 
 Uh, I'm worried about him. 
 He won't admit it, but I can tell what 
 Lim said 
 is still really bothering him. 
 If you're worried about him, 
 then you should talk to Shaun. 
 I tried that. He says he's fine. 
 It's not just about Shaun. 
 You know that, right? 
 No, it's not. Lim is shutting him out. 
 'Cause Lim is hurting. 
 Shaun's gotta take some kind 
 of responsibility for that. 
 Why? He didn't hurt her. 
 It's not so cut and dried, 
 certainly not to Lim. 
 - Well, what about for you? 
 - What about for me? 
 If Shaun's got a problem with Lim, 
 then he's gotta deal with it. 
 A medial longitudinal incision 
 is used to extend the wound 
 above and below. 
 Next steps, Dr. Powell? 
 Place clamps both proximal and distal, 
 locate the foreign bodies, 
 and remove and suture 
 with a  -  running. 
 That's exactly right. 
 Place the vascular clamps. 
 The Navy definitely gave you 
 some good training in trauma care. 
 Is that why you went to the Academy? 
 Thought it would help you 
 get into med school? 
 Can we get a little 
 bit more irrigation, please? 
 Did you ever want work 
 on a fishing boat? 
 At my high school, the people 
 who talked about joining the military 
 also wanted to work 
 on fishing boats in Alaska. 
 I hate fishing. 
 It's both cruel and boring. 
 Hm. 
 I'm guessing the shrapnel in Afghanistan 
 didn't have clown faces printed on it? 
 Nope. 
 Wait, can I see that? 
 That looks like it's from a 
 propulsive charge, not a shell. 
 - What's the difference? 
 - Shut off the electrocautery. 
 - There's still some bleeding... 
 - No, no, no, don't! 
 Aah! 
 What the hell was that? 
 Firework mortar 
 the electrocautery detonated. 
 His brachial artery's shredded. 
 Apply proximal pressure 
 and I need a a Javid shunt. 
 We stopped the bleeding and 
 restored blood flow to your arm, 
 but it's only a partial fix. 
 You'll need more tests and 
 then surgery to do a tissue flap 
 and to stabilize the shattered humerus. 
 How could it explode again? 
 Aerial fireworks 
 have two expl*sive charges. 
 The shrapnel from the propulsive charge 
 obstructed the CT view 
 of the undetonated mortar. 
 You're very lucky. 
 If it had exploded in the field, 
 you would've bled to death 
 in under    seconds. 
 Ah, I don't feel very lucky. 
 We can increase your hydromorphone. 
 You can pretend that you're 
 in a combat support hospital. 
 Make it all part of the ""realistic fun."" 
 Mm. 
 I doubt that will help, but you can try. 
 Ah, it feels like it's on fire. 
 Almost done. For now. 
 We'll need to repeat this 
 every two hours 
 to make sure you're ready to go 
 the moment the foot arrives. 
 Can you check my phone again? 
 Nothing yet. Sorry. 
 I know it was just a first date, 
 but... I thought 
 it was going really well. 
 I always think that, 
 and then find out I talked 
 too much or not enough, 
 or she actually did like me, 
 but she's heading off to grad school 
 or doesn't want anything exclusive. 
 She's probably stuck in traffic. 
 Maybe... Maybe some people 
 are just meant to be alone. 
 Yeah, I met a great woman last night. 
 Found out this morning she was married. 
 That's in the wake of a divorce 
 and a serious relationship that 
 crashed and burned a few months ago. 
 You know, finding the right person, 
 it's pretty damn hard. 
 You gotta keep trying. 
 Dr. Park and I are very different. 
 You can't have your own office, Murphy. 
 But prior attendings... 
 Were hired when we had 
 different budgetary constraints. 
 Okay, Dr. Park and I 
 have different work methods. 
 Neither of us can perform 
 at our best in a shared office. 
 There are no other offices available, 
 and I'm quite confident 
 you and Park can make it work. 
 You're just gonna have to make 
 a few compromises. 
 - Mm. But... 
 - And if I know Park, 
 I'm guessing he's already made a few, 
 which means... 
 it's your turn. 
 Officer Baxter? 
 That's me. 
 Dr. Perez, this is Dr. Allen. 
 No foot yet. 
 Just a bunch of old ball caps, 
 beer bottles, and dirty diapers. 
 Some people just don't 
 deserve nice things. 
 - Was that on the bottom? 
 - Yeah. 
 Actually got us excited for a minute. 
 I'd find some shade. 
 We're gonna be here a while. 
 It's really important that 
 we find it as soon as possible. 
 We'll find it when we find it. 
 Okay. 
 All right, well, I'll be right back. 
 I got a beach towel in my trunk. 
 You going for a swim? 
 No, just want to be able to sit 
 down without getting my pants dirty. 
 Oh. Look at you, all prepared. 
 - Yep. 
 - Such a Boy Scout! 
 What about me? 
 It's big enough for both of us. 
 Severe trauma to the distal subclavian. 
 We can do the bypass more 
 proximally than we'd planned. 
 I've seen it done 
 in a Role   field hospital. 
 It'll work. 
 Surprised you're so invested. 
 You certainly didn't seem 
 that sympathetic in the room. 
 I shouldn't have said that. 
 I can see how it would be 
 upsetting to deal with a guy 
 who thinks combat is a fun game to play. 
 - Were you ever in actual... 
 - I was wrong. 
 Well, it's okay. 
 We all let our personal... 
 No, I mean about the bypass. 
 There's avulsion of multiple 
 nerves just beyond the plexus. 
 So even if we can restore blood flow, 
 the arm would still be immobile 
 and without sensation. 
 We're gonna have to amputate. 
 We're not going to do that. 
 We can use external fixation 
 to stabilize the fracture, 
 thoracotomy for the 
 subclavian artery bypass, 
 and repair the peripheral nerves 
 with sural grafts from his leg. 
 There are multiple nerves damaged. 
 Then we will find multiple solutions. 
 We are not going to amputate. 
 Dr. Murphy, we need to talk. 
 I'm busy. 
 So am I, so I'll make it fast. 
 Keep looking for a solution 
 to those nerve injuries. 
 I will be right back. 
 Really? Uh... 
 And my desk is facing a window? 
 I also moved my desk several inches. 
 Dr. Andrews said we both 
 needed to make compromises. 
 Okay, Shaun, I told you this morning... 
 Yes, now neither of us will be bothered 
 because we won't be facing 
 each other as we work. 
 I'm not bothered by that, 
 and if you are, 
 then you should turn your desk around. 
 No, no, no, no, no. 
 I can't work facing a window. 
 People constantly walking by outside... 
 You're not the only person who 
 needs a comfortable environment 
 to do their job. 
 Now, I don't care 
 what you do with your stuff, 
 but do not move or touch 
 anything that belongs to me again. 
 Page me if you find a surgical solution. 
 Murphy wants his own office. 
 - Is that surprising? 
 - No. 
 What was surprising was him 
 coming to me instead of his supervisor. 
 Okay. I'm not sure why 
 you're sharing that with me. 
 Is there a problem between 
 Murphy and Lim I should be aware of? 
 Maybe. 
 Care to elaborate? 
 If there's a problem between Lim 
 and Shaun, why are you asking me? 
 Because I value your insight, 
 and I'm under the impression 
 that they're both 
 close friends of yours. 
 Okay, so it's definitely my 
 responsibility to sort that out. 
 Mm... 
 Not a bad spot 
 for a post-date skinny-dip. 
 As long as you stay out 
 of the speedboat lane. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're not a skinny-dipper? 
 Definitely not. 
 Ooh. A strong aversion. Interesting. 
 Ahh. Is it the... uh, the cold water, 
 the nudity, 
 or you just hate swimming? 
 All of the above. 
 I don't do outdoor naked 
 or outdoor hookups. 
 Mm. 
 Same goes for cars, 
 airplanes, elevators. 
 Mm. 
 I'm more of a comfortable, 
 private spot type of girl. 
 Good to know. 
 I definitely agree 
 on the planes and elevators, 
 and I'm not a big fan of cars myself, 
 but, uh, tractor combines... 
 phew, they're a whole 'nother story. 
 - Tractor combines? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 I don't know. Just something 
 about being high up, 
 looking out over a few hundred 
 acres of alfalfa blowing in the breeze. 
 - What? 
 - You are a strange dude. 
 And why do you keep 
 a beach towel in your trunk? 
 I do yoga in the park after work. 
 Ah, yes, the yoga. 
 - You should try it sometime. 
 - Mm. 
 Might help soften up 
 some of that cynicism. 
 I'd rather be cynical than gullible. 
 Found a diamond ring in an ear of corn. 
 Oh, God. It's true, all right? 
 You can ask my dad. 
 He's known that farmer his entire life. 
 And now I know where you got it from. 
 The apple doesn't fall far 
 from the alfalfa. 
 Okay. 
 There's an active bleed 
 at the debridement site. 
 - BP's plummeting. 
 - Damn it. 
 We have to get the stump closed. 
 No, that'll make it impossible 
 to replant his foot. 
 There's still time for them to find it. 
 I just need to stop the bleed. 
 I can't get the bleeding under control. 
 If I ligate, it'll clot, but if I don't, 
 the reduced flow will destroy 
 everything we've already fixed. 
 Still no word? 
 I just got off the phone with Dr. Allen. 
 They still haven't found it. 
 Let's get him to the OR. 
 We need to fully close the wound. 
 You tried your best. 
 What're you doing, Murphy? 
 Oh. Setting up my new office. 
 No, you're not. 
 I told you there was no extra space. 
 But you were wrong. 
 Nurse Hawks told me this room 
 has not been used by anyone in months. 
 Because we need it for storage. 
 We can still use it for storage. 
 There's room for my new desk 
 and all this other stuff, 
 which won't distract me by sharpening 
 pencils, doing back stretches, 
 looking at me, or breathing. 
 Fine. For now. 
 But as soon as someone needs it, 
 I'm kicking you out. 
 Thank you, Dr. Andrews! 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Got it. 
 You owe me    bucks. 
 We still have another hour. 
 Park couldn't control the bleeding. 
 He's moving the guy to the OR 
 to close the wound. 
 We can still scrub in 
 if we beat traffic. 
 Hey! Where are you going? 
 I got five little piggies 
 that need to go home. 
 Page Park. 
 Already am. 
 We need to repair the left 
 subclavian artery first. 
 But we still need a way 
 to get distal control. 
 Couldn't we just extend the incision 
 to the supraclavicular one? 
 No. That risks transection 
 of the phrenic nerve. 
 So, why did you want to join the Navy? 
 Couldn't afford to pay for college? 
 You wanted to see the world? 
 Why are you so obsessed with this? 
 I'm just... curious. 
 I'm trying to get to know you. 
 Clearly, you have some sort 
 of judgmental notion 
 about the type of people 
 that join the military. 
 I'm not judging you. 
 I'm genuinely impressed. 
 Because I know how to treat 
 a puncture wound and read a CT? 
 Do you have such low expectations 
 of all veterans or just the amputees? 
 Hello. I have resolved the issue. 
 We use biopolymer grafts 
 to repair multiple nerves. 
 Oh. I can definitely think 
 more clearly in my new office. 
 Great. 
 Forceps. 
 Some of the tissues edges look necrotic. 
 You gonna be able to remove it all? 
 Hope so. Grab the DeBakey scissors, 
 and cut off the non-viable tissue. 
 You mind keeping your eyes on the road? 
 Sorry. It's just... that's pretty cool. 
 -  on a prolene castro. 
 Get the transplant unit open and ready. 
 It's been seven hours 
 of cold ischemia time. 
 We gotta get it perfused ASAP. 
 All right. 
 Yeah, we get perfusion. 
 It's nearing the eight-hour mark. 
 They got off 
 the freeway four minutes ago. 
 Could be traffic. 
 No, they're in a squad car with a siren. 
 Which you'd think would 
 make people get out of the way, 
 but apparently not. 
 Nice color. Healthy edges. 
 Great work. Scrub in, and let's do this. 
 Biopolymer grafts aren't going to work. 
 The gap's too wide. 
 Nerve defects from 
 the expl*si*n are too big. 
 Even if we bridge the nerves, 
 what do we do about all this bleeding? 
 We have to amputate. 
 We have no choice. 
 Dr. Murphy? 
 We can do an end-to-side neurorrhaphy 
 with coaptation of the distal stump 
 of the transected nerves 
 to adjacent donor nerves. 
 But what do we do about the bleeding? 
 - If we can't stop it... 
 - We can facilitate anastomosis 
 by using the parachute technique. 
 - We're running out of time. 
 - I can do it. 
 Stabilizing the ankle joint. 
 Matching the ends of the posterior 
 tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. 
 His date ever show up? 
 - Nope. 
 - Use  -  prolenes. 
 I sort of feel bad for the guy. 
 In all fairness, was it right 
 for him to expect her to? 
 Well, seems like the decent thing to do. 
 Repairing the vena comitans 
 and saphenous vein. 
 Saving his life wasn't enough? 
 Ah, she still could show up, 
 and this could be a crazy story 
 they tell their kids one day. 
 Sorry, Mr. Positive, 
 but that will definitely not happen. 
 You never know. 
 Most of the people I know 
 who are in great relationships 
 had super rocky starts. 
 I can't get any pulse on the foot. 
 The anastomosis sites are hemostatic. 
 Hey, check Doppler at the femoral, 
 then work your way down 
 to where the flow stops. 
 Good in the groin. 
 No flow here. 
 He's thrombosed all the way 
 to his popliteal. 
 We may have just saved his foot, 
 but k*lled his leg. 
 Shaun? 
 I just saved my patient's arm. 
 I heard that. That... 
 That's good... good work. 
 Do you like my new office? 
 No, I don't. I don't like it. 
 Mm. I've already talked to Dr. Andrews. 
 - He agreed... 
 - It's a bad idea. 
 No. Dr. Park and I distract 
 and annoy each other. 
 We will both do better work if... 
 - That's the reason? Really? 
 - Yes, it is. 
 Why are you isolating yourself? 
 I'm not. 
 You're the one who canceled 
 our breakfast. 
 Because I don't want to have 
 to deal with this, Shaun. 
 I'm a... 
 I'm angry with you. 
 Oh. 
 - Why? 
 - ""Why?"" 
 Because of Lim's surgery. 
 Because I told you exactly what to do... 
 - No. No. 
 - ...and you didn't listen to me. 
 - The parameters changed. 
 - You went ahead and you... 
 and you did the procedure 
 you wanted to do all along. 
 Yes, the parameters changed. 
 I made the right decision. 
 Shaun, Lim is paralyzed. 
 You're the surgeon. 
 You have to take 
 some kind of responsibility for that. 
 You shouldn't be angry with me. 
 - Dr. Lim shouldn't be angry with me. 
 - She... 
 She is paralyzed, Shaun. 
 Mm. I saved her life. 
 I made the right choice. 
 You're acting like a child. 
 No. No. I'm not. 
 You're acting like you did 
 back in high school, 
 like you did at... 
 at the beginning of med school. 
 You're a grown man, Shaun. 
 You're... You're a married man now. 
 You got to take some kind of 
 responsibility, accountability. 
 You're running away. You're... You're... 
 You're... You're... You're 
 shrinking your world around you. 
 You're... You're retreating. 
 You're wrong. 
 You are being mean 
 and calling me a child. 
 - Shaun... 
 - And you are taking Dr. Lim's side... 
 Shaun, you can't shrug this off. 
 I do not want you in my office. 
 Leave now! 
 We successfully repaired your shoulder. 
 Thank you. 
 Please don't play 
 with any more fireworks. 
 You are lucky to have 
 survived your own ignorance. 
 Yeah. 
 At the very least, stick 
 to the non-expl*sive ones. 
 I'll just, uh, stick to watching 
 them on the  th of July. 
 Probably for the best. 
 Mm. 
 With lots of rehab, you should 
 regain full function of your arm. 
 Mm. 
 Feel that? 
 Just a small pinch. 
 Well, that's exactly what we want. 
 Six months of PT, and you should 
 be up on your feet walking again. 
 Thanks, Doc, for holding out 
 and not giving up on me... 
 and my foot. 
 Do me a favor? 
 Take a picture of me 
 and that gnarly scar. 
 - This for Brittany? 
 - Nah. 
 My new profile pic. 
 You will stand out. 
 I'm sorry I offended you. 
 I grew up very... sheltered. 
 I'm still trying to figure 
 things out and play catch-up 
 and get past my limited 
 sense of imagination... 
 which is just a long way 
 of saying that yes, 
 I was being ignorant and judgy and... 
 I hope you can forgive me. 
 I, um, tore my ACL. 
 Um... 
 growing up, 
 my dream was to play Division   soccer, 
 and I was pretty good. 
 Junior year of high school, 
 I had a dozen offers for a full ride. 
 That's impressive. 
 The first game of senior year, I tore my 
 ACL 
 trying to slide tackle a midfielder. 
 And just like that, 
 every D-  school rescinded. 
 The only place that still wanted 
 me was the Naval Academy. 
 I never really had much 
 interest in the military, 
 but, hey, the tuition was free. 
 I was promised a roster spot. 
 I played all four years on varsity, 
 and we even won the Patriot 
 League championship my senior year. 
 Nine months later, 
 I was deployed to Afghanistan. 
 That sounds horrible. 
 Not at all. 
 Joining the Navy was the 
 best decision I ever made. 
 I enjoyed our field trip. 
 I had a good time, too. 
 Being away from the hospital 
 and all that. Yeah. 
 It's definitely nice out here. 
 I might even have to 
 come back for a swim. 
 You could bring a date. 
 Not a bad idea. 
 Just need to find the right person. 
 Hm. 
 The bet. 
 Yes. The bet. 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 I can't. 
 Need some help? 
 Although, it's after  :  , so I'd 
 have to charge you time and a half. 
 Sweet of you to offer, 
 but I think I got this. 
 - Ohh! 
 - You sure? 
 It'd be a shame if this... 
 $   bottle of olive oil hit the ground. 
 Well, I had a good day. 
 I splurged a bit. 
 Good idea. 
 I'm sure you deserve it. 
 You do, too. 
 For saving me twice. 
 Can I offer you a taste? 
 I got a baguette at Listo's, 
 a Brie, a Gouda. 
 It's a deal. 
 Thanks. 
 This is nice. 
 Talking to someone I don't have 
 to supervise or be serious with. 
 I agree. 
 I just realized 
 I don't know what you do. 
 I'm a professional hockey player. 
 Okay, I know that's a joke. 
 Now I just have to decide if that 
 means you love hockey or hate it. 
 Now I'm curious what you'll decide. 
 Hmm. Let's see. 
 - You grew up in Michigan. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 You appear to have all your teeth. 
 Oh, but they're also perfect, 
 which means they could be veneers. 
 I'm gonna say you're a 
 Pistons fan that hates hockey. 
 It's like you can see right through me. 
 And my job? 
 Clearly, 
 you're the parking garage attendant. 
 Or you're just stalking me. 
 I'm a marketing exec at Greenzy. 
 Mm. 
 I have no idea what you guys do, 
 but I know your building. 
 There's an amazing Chilean 
 restaurant right across the street. 
 - Valeska's. 
 - Oh, I love that place. 
 I've been craving their sopapillas. 
 We should take care of that craving. 
 Dinner at Valeska's sometime? 
 Definitely. 
 Mm, yeah. 
 - You okay? 
 - Yes. 
 Thinking about work. 
 I saved my patient's arm today. 
 I should be happy. 
 So why aren't you? 
 If this is about 
 your fight with Glassman... 
 I'm thinking about 
 my patient's shoulder. 
 I have to go. 
 - Dr. Glassman! 
 - Okay! Okay! 
 Okay! Okay. What? 
 - Are you okay? 
 - Yes. 
 I know how to fix it. 
 I know how to fix everything. 
 There's a surgery 
 that will cure Lim's paralysis. 
 Oh. 
 Okay."
gdoc_6_5,6470478,6,5,"[DR. LIM] 
 Previously on 
 The Good Doctor... 
 You put me here, 
 and I'm really angry about that. 
 I am sitting in this chair 
 because of that surgery. 
 - I enjoyed our field trip. 
 - I had a good time, too. 
 I'm sorry. I just... 
 I can't. 
 [SHAUN] I know how to fix everything. 
 There's a surgery 
 that will cure Lim's paralysis. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It's not the cord. 
 It's a deformity of the spinal column. 
 Even if there's kyphosis, 
 that doesn't mean... 
 She used to have a   -degree curve. 
 Now it's   . 
 So, what do you propose? 
 We go through the abdomen 
 and chest, fix the deformity, 
 and stabilize the column 
 with cage, plate, and screws. 
 With the tension in the cord 
 relaxed, her body can heal. 
 It will fix the paralysis. 
 - That might work. 
 - [DR. GLASSMAN] Might. 
 Might work. Might doesn't cut it, 
 especially with the amount of 
 instrumentation around the spinal cord. 
 You could poke a hole 
 in the gut or in the lung. 
 Sepsis is a very real possibility. 
 I won't poke a hole in anything. 
 Do I need to remind you how 
 confident you were the last time? 
 I'm sorry, but the odds 
 aren't good enough, not for me. 
 Then better the odds. 
 You two see if you can find 
 a surgery in our comfort zone. 
 Any objections? 
 No. 
 Then I need to get started. 
 I will be very busy this week. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 And you never fainted before today? 
 No, never. 
 Actually, I guess I fainted last week. 
 I was at recess. 
 I just sort of woke up on the ground. 
 I thought you wouldn't let me 
 do the Halloween pageant. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay. 
 We just want you to get better. 
 So, you're Cinderella. 
 I have the main solo. 
 I'm singing ""No One Is Alone."" 
 [GASPS] Sondheim. I love it.

 [LAUGHTER] 
 Why is there singing? 
 And why are you... green? 
 It's Halloween. 
 Heart rate's still    BPM. 
 Hopefully, we can get you back 
 in time for your solo. 
 We can't. 
 The electrical system 
 in your heart is malfunctioning 
 and you risk cardiac arrest. 
 We can easily implant a pacemaker today 
 to keep it functioning normally. 
 Once it's in, a pacemaker is very safe. 
 W-Why is this happening to her? 
 We will do blood work 
 and electrophysiologic studies 
 to find out. 
 Plus, genetic workups 
 on all three of you. 
 If it's inherited, 
 you might be at risk, too. 
 Happy Halloween. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SPOOKY VERSION 
 OF OPENING THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I get dizzy a lot 
 'cause I banged my head 
 when I was a kid. 
 They know, buddy. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Sometimes I forget stuff, too. 
 Chris is always looking out for me. 
 He picks me up from day care every day. 
 He cooks me dinner, 
 and he lets me play video games. 
 Sounds like a good brother. 
 Tell them what we say to each other. 
 I say, ""I got your back, little bro."" 
 And then I go, 
 ""I got your back, big bro."" 
 Nice approximation of the wound edges. 
 You're good to go, Ollie. 
 [GROANS SOFTLY] 
 Back's been bugging me. 
 Joys of aging. 
 Your pants are pretty loose. 
 Lost a little weight recently. 
 When did you see a doctor last? 
 I don't know. 
 Between Ollie and looking for work... 
 Mind lifting up your shirt? 
 [GRUNTS] 
 We're gonna order lab tests 
 and a CT for you, 
 just to be safe. 
 [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 That potential assistant 
 I liked, with the septum ring? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Well, I watched her TikTok, 
 and now I'm looking for another one. 
 You reading your tablet? 
 Yes, but I'm also listening to you. 
 With the Dr. Lim surgery, 
 I have to do two jobs. 
 Well, how about you start 
 after 
 our lunch? 
 This is a growth opportunity. 
 As a boss, you need to delegate. 
 You think I write 
 every line of code myself? 
 I am a surgeon. 
 I cannot delegate surgery. 
 So, figure out the elements of your job 
 that only you can do 
 and delegate the rest. 
 That is a good idea. 
 The Force is with me. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Nice. Love it. 
 Ooh. Gorgeous. 
 So, the navy blue dress 
 or the black skirt? 
 They're all great. 
 Your date's gonna be blown away. 
 Not necessarily my date. 
 My neighbors aren't taking me 
 to romantic restaurants. 
 Your neighbors are a   -year-old couple 
 and that hermit who likes 
 to talk to his geodes. 
 It's a date, right? 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 [ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN] 
 This is my floor. 
 Wise answer, Matey. 
 Date. 
 Date. Definitely a date. 
 Which is a problem 
 'cause those outfits suck. 
 What else you got? 
 Trashy, frumpy, slutty, 
 not slutty enough. 
 God, no. Anything else? 
 In my closet. 
 We'll meet there.  :   p.m. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [JORDAN ON INTERCOM] 
 Try to hold still, Chris. 
 This will just take a few minutes. 
 Okay. 
 I would have thought that you 
 had more Halloween spirit. 
 Oh, I have a lot. 
 But as a professional woman, 
 I express it after work. 
 - Interesting. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 What are you up to? 
 There's a big pub crawl 
 around San Pedro Square. 
 A bunch of us are going. 
 That sounds fun. 
 Want to join? 
 I think I'll skip. But thanks. 
 No problem. 
 I think I made things weird 
 between us last night. 
 It's fine. 
 A three-centimeter mass 
 partially compressing the bile duct. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Pancreatic cancer. 
 Hey. 
 You wearing that in the OR? 
 I got the genetic testing back. 
 Skyler has hemochromatosis. 
 Explains the heart problems. 
 Yes, but look at her parents' results. 
 Mom carries the recessive gene. 
 But not her dad. 
 Which means he's not her dad. 
 And given how he let us test him, 
 he doesn't know it. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ASHER] What are we gonna 
 tell her parents? 
 [SHAUN] The genetic testing results. 
 Placing the generator 
 in the infraclavicular pocket. 
 [ASHER] Any thoughts on how? 
 Without destroying 
 their marriage, I mean? 
 I will delegate that task to you two. 
 It will be a growth opportunity. 
 You also need to inform 
 Skyler's biological father 
 that he's the carrier. 
 [POWELL] Well, we don't know who he is. 
 Then it will be an even bigger 
 growth opportunity. 
 Adsons and  -  vicryl. 
 [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You have stage three pancreatic cancer. 
 That means it hasn't metastasized yet, 
 but it's spread to your lymph nodes. 
 So, I'll... I'll do chemo? 
 Chemo, radiation, molecular therapy 
 would give you about eight months. 
 There is a very extensive surgery 
 called the Whipple procedure. 
 It involves removing your gallbladder 
 as well as parts of your bile duct, 
 pancreas, and intestines. 
 Okay. When can we do it? 
 It only has a small chance of success, 
 and if it fails, you'll have 
 less time and more pain. 
 When Ollie was a kid, 
 my mom worked from home a lot. 
 She always had me looking 
 after him, which I hated. 
 One day, I was reading comics... 
 and he fell down the stairs. 
 You were just a kid yourself. 
 Ollie's injury isn't your fault. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I will do anything to be there for him. 
 We'll order the pre-op testing 
 for the Whipple procedure. 
 I'm busy. 
 No, you are waiting on your 
 patient's ear wax to soften. 
 We can use a thoracoscopic 
 and laparoscopic approach 
 with endoscopic decompression. 
 I want to present it to Dr. Lim. 
 No. 
 This approach has been used 
 for tumor surgery. 
 Did you say ""surgery""? 
 We're not talking about you! 
 It's less invasive than my initial idea, 
 with a lower risk of vascular injury. 
 I said no, Shaun. 
 This is wild. It's like Rice 
 Krispies popping in my ear. 
 [MUFFLED SPEECH AND CRACKLING] 
 I did what Dr. Andrews said. 
 I lowered the risk of injury. 
 You didn't do what Dr. Andrews said. 
 You didn't raise the chance 
 - that we're gonna fix her paralysis. 
 - Paralysis? 
 - I am not talking about you. 
 - We're not talking about you! 
 Tilt your head. 
 Not good enough. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Jacob will be back soon. 
 Let's start with us. 
 The pacemaker is working great. 
 [SIGHS] Thank God. 
 But she has a genetic disease 
 called hemochromatosis. 
 Um, excess iron 
 is building up in her body. 
 That's why she was having heart issues? 
 Yeah. 
 And there's a small amount 
 of damage to her liver, 
 but it looks like 
 we caught that in time. 
 Iron is carried in red blood cells, 
 so the main treatment 
 is just regular blood draws. 
 That's it? Great. 
 Because of the forms you signed, 
 we're supposed to tell you and 
 your husband these results together 
 and explain that hemochromatosis 
 is a recessive genetic disorder, 
 which means that for Skyler 
 to have the condition, 
 the gene needs to be carried 
 by both parents. 
 And then we'd explain that you carry it, 
 but... your husband doesn't. 
 But that doesn't... 
 Oh, God. 
 Oh, God. 
 [SOBS] 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Jacob's old college roommate. 
 We were really close 
 with him and his wife. 
 Jacob suspected, but I denied it. 
 He was just so amazing, 
 and I was in a rut. 
 Jacob and I are good now. 
 Skyler is his daughter. 
 I don't want that to change. 
 We can't avoid your husband 
 finding out his test results. 
 Can you give us 
 the biological dad's info? 
 He needs to know he's a carrier. 
 I don't want him involved. 
 We can't tell him anything 
 about you or Skyler. 
 Privacy laws. 
 But if he has other children, 
 they could be in danger. 
 Mick Kang. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] I better go 
 talk to my husband now. 
 Are you trying to look 
 like a stalk of celery? 
 [SIGHS] 
 - Oh. 
 - Ohh! 
 My go-to in the before times. 
 Pair it with... 
 The Louis Vuitton blouse? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - Yes. 
 And... these. 
 Hot, classic. 
 Well done. 
 Only issue... 
 They could be hard to get off. 
 A feature or a bug, depending. 
 [SIGHS] Let's take a break. 
 What's going on? 
 I'm a different person now, 
 with a different body. 
 That he apparently finds attractive. 
 You'll figure it out. 
 It's not only sex. 
 I worry I'm just racing 
 to start my life again. 
 How much do I even like him? 
 Is he a nice guy? 
 Definitely. 
 Cute? 
 Pretty cute. 
 Having just lost a nice 
 and pretty cute guy, 
 it goes a long way. 
 This'll work. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Doesn't look like 
 we can preserve the pylorus. 
 We can reassess early in the surgery. 
 I was an idiot the other night. 
 When I almost kissed you. 
 Obviously, I like you. 
 But it's a line I can't cross. 
 If this is because we work together... 
 It's not. 
 I can't date anyone right now. 
 But I really hope 
 we can keep being friends. 
 Okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 If we don't do a distal, 
 we run the risk of... 
 Hold up. 
 We clearly both like each other, 
 but nothing can happen 
 for some reason you won't share. 
 But you still want to hang out? 
 Yeah. 
 Let's look at the common hepatic artery. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
 Our other growth opportunity's 
 waiting in the cafeteria. 
 You think I carry a gene for this... 
 [POWELL] Hemochromatosis. 
 So, if you have kids... 
 Yeah, two boys. Six-year-old twins. 
 The warning signs would be bronzed skin, 
 liver problems, 
 lack of energy, joint pain. 
 No. 
 As far as I know, 
 they're totally healthy. 
 How did you find out I'm a carrier? 
 I've never even been to this hospital. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We're limited by privacy laws. 
 But as long as you and your kids 
 get checked out, you'll be fine. 
 Privacy laws? Who... Whose privacy? 
 I'm sorry. We can't say anything more. 
 Jacob? 
 Daisy had a kid? 
 Hey, look, man, um, they just... 
 they called me in here. 
 - I didn't... 
 - [ASHER] No! 
 No, no, no, no, no. Don't! 
 Ah! 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ASHER] Ow. 
 Okay, residents, 
 that did not work at all. 
 You chose a very bad place to meet Mick, 
 and then Mick got his nose broken, 
 and then Mick complained 
 that you got his nose broken, 
 and then Dr. Andrews berated 
 me for not being a good attending 
 when all I did was delegate 
 to the two of you. 
 She suggested meeting him 
 in the cafeteria. 
 And you didn't object. 
 As a feminist, it's not my place to... 
 You both did terrible jobs. 
 I have to work on Dr. Lim's surgery. 
 Go check on Skyler's pacemaker. 
 [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [JORDAN] I can see 
 the common hepatic artery. 
 [DR. PARK] Resecting the 
 large lymph node anterior to it. 
 [PEREZ] Dr. Park, the abdominal wall. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 That's not local spread. 
 [DR. PARK] Metastasis. We can't finish. 
 We have to close him up, 
 reverse what we can. 
 We will go in posteriorly at T -L . 
 With no anterior instrumentation, 
 she'll be at a lower risk 
 of postsurgical complications, 
 and her prognosis will be improved 
 by completing posterior osteotomies 
 to release tension on the cord. 
 Still too risky. 
 Have you even apologized to Lim yet? 
 I have nothing to apologize for. 
 Oh, my God. Shaun. 
 Oh, you are still mad at me 
 for not following orders. 
 That's why you keep 
 sh**ting down my ideas. 
 You didn't listen to me, 
 and you're refusing 
 to accept responsibility, 
 so yeah, I'm a little mad, 
 but I'm sh**ting down your ideas 
 because they're too risky. 
 I don't believe that. 
 Okay, fine, don't believe it, then. 
 I want you to stop being mad at me 
 so you will like my ideas again. 
 Doesn't work that way. 
 Then how does it work? 
 How long are you going to be mad at me? 
 I don't know. 
 I'm gonna go finish my clinic hours. 
 [MOANING SOFTLY] 
 Is there something wrong 
 with her pacemaker? 
 Her heart is fine. 
 She has jaundice. Her liver is failing. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Hypotension from the heart block 
 caused unexpected shock liver. 
 She has been listed 
 for a transplant on UNOS. 
 I've asked for an exception 
 to speed it up, 
 but at this rate, she will die 
 before a donor liver becomes available. 
 We tested her mom. 
 She's not a good match, 
 and her dad isn't either, 
 since he's not her dad. 
 What about her biological father? 
 The mom's been calling him, 
 but apparently he blocked her. 
 We could try. 
 You got him punched in the face. 
 I will talk with him instead. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 No. Y-You said before 
 that I might have eight months. 
 We didn't know it had metastasized. 
 I always said I wouldn't do this to him. 
 You're not doing 
 anything to him. You're sick. 
 He's gonna wind up in a group home. 
 [JORDAN] There are good ones. 
 Patient Services can advise you. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Should we get your brother 
 so you two can talk? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Yeah. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 - Got a minute? 
 - Not really. 
 Patient of mine... 
 he's devoted his life 
 to taking care of his brother, 
 who's got a traumatic brain injury, 
 but he's dying of pancreatic 
 cancer and he's terrified. 
 The Whipple procedure is the only... 
 This isn't a surgical question. 
 I was hoping you'd talk to them. 
 About your experiences with Steve, 
 and after he died. 
 Why? 
 It would be great for them to 
 see how well you've turned out. 
 I don't know his brother 
 will turn out well. 
 I have ASD, but he has a brain injury. 
 - I know, but... 
 - I lived in a bus. 
 I don't know where they live, 
 but it is almost certainly not a bus 
 or you would have already mentioned it. 
 I still think it could help. 
 It's much more likely I can help 
 with fixing Dr. Lim's paralysis. 
 Your patient is dying anyway. 
 Why are you in this office? 
 I have a meeting. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 You're making this worse with Shaun. 
 You do realize that, don't you? 
 You're making him more upset. 
 He's got to take responsibility 
 for what he did. 
 He's trying. 
 And you staying pissed at him 
 isn't going to help that process. 
 Which is exactly why 
 I'm gonna stay away. 
 Well, you can't avoid him forever. 
 - Yes, I can. 
 - Stop it! 
 You're mad at him. 
 He's not going to apologize. 
 Someone's got to make the first move. 
 And that has got to be me? 
 Yeah, of course it does. 
 He's a grown man, and he's your husband. 
 He has ASD, and he's your son. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Your daughter is in liver failure. 
 None of her relatives are 
 suitable donors, but you might be. 
 You want me to give my liver? 
 Just one lobe. 
 The full liver would k*ll you. 
 I've never met her. 
 I mean, I... 
 I only heard about her 
 a couple days ago. 
 Okay, you're... 
 you're biologically linked. 
 That gives you responsibility. 
 I have two little boys who need me, 
 a wife I'm already 
 in couples therapy with. 
 I feel sorry for this girl. 
 I really do. 
 But I cannot destroy my family for her. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 My brother's going to be okay. 
 We're going on a trip. 
 Ollie, 
 how about Nurse Hawks here 
 takes you to the cafeteria 
 to get some ice cream, hmm? 
 Sundae? 
 Go for it. 
 I found a website for a clinic in Mexico 
 that offers a cure 
 for pancreatic cancer. 
 Immunotherapy, stem cells, supplements. 
 [JORDAN] I know these clinics. 
 They're scams 
 preying on desperate people. 
 What do I have to lose? 
 Your money, for one thing. 
 Your brother will need it 
 after you're gone. 
 If he loses me... 
 he'll never make it. 
 He will. 
 You don't understand. 
 Growing up, um, 
 my family was really close. 
 We worked the farm together. 
 My brother... 
 My brother was my best friend. 
 One day, the tractor rolled, 
 and my brother herniated a disk 
 getting it back up. 
 Doctor gave him Oxy, 
 and    months later 
 he moved on to heroin. 
 Counselors, they, um... 
 they told me, my mom, 
 my dad to cut him off, 
 that he needed to hit rock bottom. 
 So we did. 
 And he did. 
 For a while there, 
 it felt like he was gone. 
 My brother tells me now 
 that our family's love, 
 everything my parents taught him, 
 that's what got him through. 
 We saved him, 
 even when we weren't there. 
 Last month, he actually, um... 
 he marked five years sober. 
 Ollie can handle this. 
 Tell him the truth. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - [MAN] Don't argue with me. 
 - [GIRL] I'm not! 
 Stop acting like a brat. 
 Let's go now. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] 
 That was school. 
 You hit Susan Dawkins again? 
 She was being mean to me, 
 like she always is. 
 Well, we talked about this, Maddie. 
 All you got to do is... is stay away. 
 Why do I have to change what 
 I 
 do 
 when she's the one who's mean? 
 Because hitting people 
 isn't acceptable, Maddie. 
 Sometimes in life, 
 people are gonna be mean. 
 You always make everything my fault. 
 No, I don't. 
 You're supposed to be on my side. 
 I'm trying to be on your side, 
 but you make it damn near impossible 
 because you never listen to me! 
 You don't listen. 
 You just boss me around. 
 Oh, my God. Okay. You know what? 
 - Just go to your room. 
 - No. 
 What did you say to me? Go to your room. 
 I hate you. 
 I said go to your room! 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Hepatic encephalopathy. 
 Without a new liver, 
 she'll be dead by tomorrow. 
 Did you get the exception from UNOS? 
 No. 
 Then it's over. 
 It's not. 
 Her biological father 
 could still be a match. 
 First, you two failed with Mick, 
 then I failed with Mick. 
 We need to figure it out 
 together this time. 
 Ollie... 
 we're not gonna go to Mexico. 
 Are you better? 
 No. 
 Are you dying? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Yeah. 
 But we are gonna spend 
 every minute together. 
 And I'm gonna find you 
 a great group home. 
 And I know that's hard. 
 Ollie, I am so sorry. 
 Rajan's in a group home. 
 Rajan. 
 From my day group. 
 He says he's got his own bedroom 
 and the people are nice.

 [SIGHS] 
 I 
 am 
 mad at you. 
 And for good reason. 
 But no matter how mad I get, 
 I never stop loving you. 
 I didn't tell that to Maddie enough. 
 I don't know what you want me 
 to take away from that. 
 That I love you. 
 I do too. 
 And that I had good reasons, 
 non-emotional reasons, 
 for sh**ting down your earlier ideas. 
 But I think there might be something 
 to that endoscopic plan, maybe. 
 Do you have any of her CT scans? 
 I have many of them.

 We'll go in posteriorly with minimally 
 invasive percutaneous screws 
 and do a complete 
 vertebral column resection 
 at the maximally kyphosed segments, 
 then reconstruct the vertebral 
 bodies with an expandable cage. 
 You're building 
 a whole new spinal column. 
 It's the safest way to remove 
 the tension in your cord 
 and let your body do its work. 
 You came around? 
 I wouldn't say I came around exactly, 
 but I don't think it's crazy to say yes. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] At this point, 
 it's not a medical question. 
 It's an emotional one. 
 You got to ask yourself, 
 how bad do you want out of that chair? 
 I'll think on it. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You look... 
 I'm gonna use 
 a highly precise term here... 
 snazzy. 
 Well, I spent hours applying 
 very expensive snazz.

 - You look great, too. 
 Thanks. 
 Reservation for two under Joseph. 
 One moment. 
 Is this the only entrance 
 into the dining room? 
 It's an old building. I'm so sorry. 
 A couple of waiters 
 are coming down right now. 
 They'll carry you 
 and the chair upstairs. 
 It's no problem. 
 Um... 
 You know, I have always loved 
 this little courtyard area out here. 
 Could you possibly bring down 
 one of those corner tables 
 and a couple of chairs? 
 Uh, just one, actually. I come equipped. 
 I'll make it happen. 
 Thank you.

 A New Hope

 of course, a perfect movie. 
 Correct. 
 But, talking about the recent ones, 
 ah, there's one that, 
 for me, really stands out. 
 Rogue One. 
 Yes! Oh! 
 Oh, that ending! 
 Genuinely a stunner. 
 Oh, not just for the franchise, 
 but for any Hollywood blockbuster. 
 So, what are we watching? 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I didn't think that, uh... 
 Should I go? 
 Yeah.

 I'm guessing it wasn't a date? 
 If it would help, I could tell you about 
 what I thought was a 
 romantic trip to Acapulco 
 right after my accident. 
 It wouldn't. 
 It never even occurred to him 
 that I would think it was a date. 
 Don't do the surgery. 
 Whatever Dr. Murphy is proposing 
 I'm sure sounds pretty good right now. 
 Do you even know what he's proposing? 
 This is about you wanting 
 your old life back at any cost. 
 I've been where you are. 
 The first year after I lost my leg, 
 I would have risked anything 
 to get it back. 
 But I like my life now. 
 I like who I am now. 
 - Give yourself time. 
 - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Skyler? Can you hear us? 
 Mommy? 
 Oh, careful. 
 You've got a lot of stitches. 
 What happened? 
 You got really sick, 
 but these doctors fixed you up. 
 This man gave you part of his liver. 
 [JACOB] He saved your life. 
 Who are you? 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I'm Mick. 
 See you on Monday. 
 Five years sober, huh? 
 Do you even have a brother? 
 I do. 
 But, um, he's not the addict. 
 And... 
 your addiction, 
 is that the reason 
 why you and I can't... 
 Yeah. 
 About six months ago, I had a setback. 
 Bought some heroin. 
 Flushed it before I took it, but still. 
 My first priority is making it 
 to midnight without using. 
 My second is becoming a surgeon. 
 And I don't know how to add a 
 third without risking the others. 
 Thank you for trusting me. 
 I really hope we can be friends. 
 Yeah. 
 We're friends. 
 I have reserved an OR for 
 tomorrow afternoon in case... 
 I've decided against the surgery. 
 Thank you for your work. 
 Why? 
 She doesn't owe us 
 an explanation, Shaun. 
 Yes, she does. 
 I revised my plan, like you told me. 
 Shaun. 
 I can look for less invasive methods. 
 - [DR. GLASSMAN] Shaun, stop. 
 - I-It's not fair. 
 Shaun, stop. 
 - If your concern is recovery time... 
 - You know what? 
 - You don't have to stay for this. 
 - I can show... 
 Stop! 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It's not fair. 
 Tell me the reasons 
 why you think it's not fair, 
 and I'll try to explain it. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 I heard Lim said no to the surgery. 
 You did the right thing trying. 
 It accomplished nothing. 
 When I went back to Hershey 
 to help my family's company, 
 I thought it would fix the business, 
 fix things with my brother, 
 fix things with my parents. 
 Failed on all three. 
 But I'm glad I did it. 
 That makes no sense. 
 I'd rather do my best and fail 
 than always regret not trying. 
 When people are in pain, 
 try to help them. 
 Even if you think 
 it won't change anything? 
 That only makes it braver. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Thanks for coming. 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 Dr. Park wants me to talk 
 to you about my life. 
 I don't know if I can help. 
 But I am going to try.

 A brutal heat wave... 
 Barely  :  , and it's already...

 The extreme temperatures... 
 What are you wearing? 
 A rechargeable cooling vest. 
 Kevin says it's going to be 
 degrees today, 
 and this will maintain my core 
 temperature for up to eight hours. 
 I also have a neck fan, 
 personal hydration pack, and... 
 ...cooling hoodie. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 You, uh, really went for it. 
 It's an investment in our future. 
 We will need these

 If you need to... 
 you can borrow my hoodie. 
 ...stay hydrated, 
 especially if you're elderly

 During this high heat advisory, 
 please, please stay inside. 
 Out of the frying pan, into the fire. 
 [SIGHS] Seriously. 
 Is the AC even on? 
 It's working fine at the VA gym. 
 My wheelchair basketball team's 
 taking refuge over there later today. 
 We could use a sh**ting guard. 
 Not sure I'm quite ready 
 to drain threes in this thing. 
 An iced cap, though. 
 You're with me today, Dr. Powell. 
 Sweet. 
 Do I get matching gear? 
 Like a Team Murphy uniform? 
 No. 
 Spinal cord injuries disrupt 
 autonomic homeostasis, 
 so patients are more 
 susceptible to the heat. 
 If she'd had the surgery I proposed, 
 Dr. Lim would be better able 
 to regulate that temperature. 
 It was too early for her 
 to make that decision. 
 No. 
 The longer she waits, the higher 
 her risk of irreversible edema. 
 There's many factors to consider. 
 That's why I told her 
 not to rush into it. 
 Excuse me. 
 Y-You are a first-year resident. 
 I have much more 
 surgical experience than you. 
 And I have much more physical 
 disability experience than you.

 You want Fred and Ginger

 The heat's made your V-tach worse. 
 My heart's kept me going    years,

 And call me Edna. 
 Ninety? Come on. I don't buy it.

 Nice work, Doc. 
 Other than cracking her ribs. 
 We better get a chest CT, 
 see how bad the damage is. 
 You're not old. 
 This is Brooks Mosey,   . 
 He collapsed during 
 his daily   -mile bike ride. 
 Yeah, the heat caught me off-guard. 
 I'm just dehydrated. 
 You should watch The Weather Channel. 
 Start an IV. 
 Oh. We need to start an IO line. 
 I can't find a good vein. 
 That's because you didn't 
 tap the vein to make it dilate. 
 He's dehydrated. He needs an IO line. 
 No, he needs a doctor 
 with more experience. 
 Please change 
 that patient's catheter bag.

 Her core temp's    . She's critical. 
 Axilla's packed. Two cooling blankets. 
 None of it's helping.

 This heat's frying her organs. 
 That's the smoke detector. 
 You leave the stove on, Marty? 
 She needs cold nasogastric lavage. 
 I'm scared, Marty. 
 May, my name is Dr. Perez. 
 You're at a hospital. 
 We're gonna take good care of you. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

 Ah.

 Oh, it's, uh, Tango Tuesday. 
 We do all things Argentinian. 
 That explains... 
 That guy takes three dance lessons, 
 and she's all over him. 
 Mm. 
 Fred and Ginger? 
 Every bit as adorable as they look. 
 Like two dancing prunes. 
 A couple in their twilight years 
 displaying affection makes you pissy? 
 It's Tinder, isn't it? 
 I saw your profile. 
 What are you doing on Tinder? 
 Spying on my coworkers. 
 I don't blame you for being cranky. 
 There's nothing more depressing 
 than a few laps around the dating pool.

 Arthur Abbott? 
 Art? 
 Okay, well, he couldn't have 
 gotten far. He's... 
 Hundred years old, as of today. 
 Oh, Art's one spry son of a bitch. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 I hear you saved my life today. 
 And fractured some ribs in the process. 
 Mm. 
 Which led to us doing a CT 
 that showed a tumor 
 running from your right lung 
 to your belly. 
 Can you remove it? 
 Yes, but at your age, 
 I'm not sure your body could 
 handle such a big surgery. 
 I'd recommend you leave it. 
 You'd have several good months. 
 Months? 
 Six, maybe seven. 
 You saved my life once today. 
 I'm sure you can do it again. 
 Edna, I'm just not comfortable 
 doing the surgery. 
 Then I want another opinion. 
 And another butterscotch pudding. 
 Hmm? If it's not too much trouble. 
 [WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Hmm. 
 Dr. Powell's not your favorite employee? 
 We are not allowed to have favorites, 
 but if we were, 
 she would not be mine. 
 - She is very annoying. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 I've got    employees, 
 seven of whom are annoying, 
 and of those seven, 
 four are my best employees. 
 They consistently challenge me 
 with opposing points of view. 
 Hmm. 
 [GRUNTS, GASPS] 
 I can't br-breathe. 
 - [ALARM BLARING] 
 - Aah! 
 Code Blue! 
 - Oh! 
 - Heart rate is   ! I need a crash cart! 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SHAUN] It's a structural issue 
 causing cardiac ischemia. 
 Then we would've heard a murmur. 
 - What about a coronary vasospasm? 
 - N-No. 
 Brooks' troponins 
 are only mildly elevated. 
 Hi, Lea. 
 His electrolytes were off. 
 Could've been a vasovagal 
 response to dehydration. 
 You're wrong. 
 And your opposing 
 points of view are not useful. 
 It is structural. 
 We came here because it's 
 degrees cooler than everywhere else. 
 Dr. Powell did not come to work 
 prepared for the heat. 
 Go set up a coronary angio. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It's     out here. 
 Why would Art leave the hospital? 
 It's called dementia. 
 Spry or not, he couldn't have 
 hobbled this far. 
 Put a wander bracelet on him 
 like Andrews told you to, 
 we wouldn't be on this hunt 
 for the Walking Dead. 
 Andrews was looking at you, not me. 
 Should we talk about 
 what's really bothering you? 
 You look on over there for the old 
 guy you lost, and I'll look over here. 
 It's up to    degrees in here. 
 Anything over 
 will compromise the servers. 
 What's with Mr. Grumpy? 
 I'm not Mr. Grumpy. 
 Mm. You were with Powell. 
 I don't like her. 
 'Cause she's a bad resident? 
 She... makes a lot of mistakes, 
 but no more than the others. 
 So it's her personality? 
 She's annoying. 
 - How is she annoying? 
 - She's... 
 contrary. 
 Oh. Kind of sounds like someone we know? 
 Yes. But I like Morgan. 
 The first step to getting 
 past your issues with her is 
 identifying them. 
 And why do I need to get past my issues? 
 [THUD, POWER WHIRS OFF] 
 [LEA] And there's the blackout. 
 [POWER WHIRS ON] 
 [SHAUN] Oh. 
 That didn't last long. 
 That's just the backup 
 generators kicking in. 
 And how long they will last, 
 I have no idea. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We got your labs and imaging back. 
 Heat has caused damage 
 to your heart and lungs. 
 It's permanent. 
 And, um... 
 You're dying, May. 
 Very soon. 
 A matter of hours. 
 But we'll make sure you're not in 
 any pain and keep you comfortable. 
 Do you have any family we can call? 
 No. 
 My husband passed last year. 
 Didn't he? 
 Is there anyone you want 
 to be here with you? 
 Marty was always the social one. 
 We talked about seeing the world. 
 Marty and I finally booked a... 
 a-a trip to celebrate 
 our   th wedding anniversary. 
 To Paris. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 But he got cancer. 
 He still wanted to go, but... I said no, 
 we needed to get him better first. 
 [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Hi, Edna. 
 I'm Dr. Aaron Glassman. 
 I understand you wanted 
 a second set of eyes. 
 Thank you for coming so quickly. 
 Well, I was in the neighborhood. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 How you handling the heat? 
 Well, I brought you this. 
 In case you want to use it later. 
 Any shortness of breath? 
 I've had that for ages. 
 It doesn't really bother me. 
 At the home, everything's right there. 
 Well, that's convenient. 
 It is. 
 I do like to go to the courtyard. 
 They have a beautiful 
 eucalyptus tree there. 
 When my granddaughter visited 
 from Eugene last summer, 
 we sat out there and just 
 watched the leaves rustle. 
 Well, that sounds just lovely. 
 It was. 
 May I? 
 Does it hurt when I press here? 
 Okay, okay. I'll take that as a yes. 
 Any problems with memory, 
 forgetfulness, confusion? 
 I 
 am 
 . 
 But I just won all three matches 
 at last week's cribbage game. 
 So I guess it could be worse. 
 Card sharp, huh? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Edna, this tumor's a monster. 
 To take it out would be very risky. 
 You might not survive 
 the procedure, or worse. 
 Ventilator, chronic pain, 
 immobilization. 
 Dr. Park went through 
 all of this with you? 
 Yes, he did. 
 I want the surgery. 
 And another butterscotch pudding. 
 When you have a moment. 
 I'll see what I can do. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We're doing the surgery. 
 You know Edna's heart stopped, right? 
 And restarted without a defibrillator. 
 This is a huge surgery 
 for a   -year-old. 
 And? Age isn't the only issue. 
 Okay, she has no idea 
 what she's getting herself into. 
 I think she does. 
 Well, she's blindly optimistic. 
 Or is it blind faith? 
 What's the difference? 
 She wants to have the surgery. 
 That faith could destroy what 
 little quality of life she has left. 
 Her call. 
 W-We need to radically 
 slash power consumption. 
 Your servers are pulling more 
 energy than any other department. 
 For good reason. 
 If all of our servers go down, 
 that'll take out the SmartEnergy Hub. 
 What's a SmartEnergy Hub? 
 It directs power to areas 
 that need it the most 
 and reduces it to areas that don't. 
 Without it, I can't guarantee 
 the generators won't overload. 
 Our backup system needs a backup? 
 If we didn't have the Hub, 
 we'd be working in the dark already. 
 We need to act now. 
 Shut down the top two floors, 
 relocate the patients. 
 And compromise the medical care 
 of over    people? 
 I'll look after the patients, 
 you look after that Hub. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We need to talk about 
 why I don't like you. 
 Sounds fun. 
 Your hand lotion smells 
 strongly of almonds. 
 Injecting contrast. 
 You are stubborn and intractable, 
 as demonstrated by refusing 
 to transplant a pig's heart, 
 ignoring proper procedure 
 for inserting an IV... 
 And I didn't back you up 
 on Lim's surgery. 
 You were wrong about that too. 
 The feeling's mutual. 
 Very stubborn. 
 And... almonds. 
 I've seen you get distracted 
 when something irritates 
 your sensibilities. 
 Never seen that make you a jackass. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 The coronary artery is coming 
 off the pulmonary, not the aorta. 
 This is very rare and will require 
 a very complicated surgery. 
 He could drop dead at any minute. 
 Yes, he could. 
 Okay. 
 How about a coronary artery bypass? 
 [FAN WHIRS] 
 Swamp cooler. 
 Okay, Brooks' anatomy is 
 far too complex for a bypass. 
 We won't have all the necessary 
 information until we open him up. 
 Why don't we do a cardiac MRI first? 
 That would be useless. His 
 arteries are too tortuous and dilated. 
 It'd make interpretation 
 of images impossible. 
 Okay, so your plan is to have no plan? 
 My plan is to open him up, 
 observe, and improvise. 
 You can't improvise 
 the most complicated... 
 Stop contradicting me. 
 I have more surgical 
 experience than you. 
 Yes, and it's your job to teach me. 
 Then why do you act 
 like you know as much as I do? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Knowing why I don't like her 
 isn't going to help 
 because she won't change. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You're off the case. 
 [POWER WHIRS OFF] 
 [SIGHS] 
 We just lost our first server. 
 How about ECMO and CRRT? 
 That could bridge May to multi-organ 
 transplant and we could even... 
 Danny, she won't even 
 tolerate anticoagulation. 
 Right. 
 [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 How you holding up, Chief? 
 My office is a sauna, the Wi-Fi died, 
 and I just lost 
 my last two hours of work. 
 Well, Andrews just put the hospital 
 and the ER on full divert status, 
 so we both have 
 the next couple hours free. 
 The AC at the VA is still working. 
 Oh, I have physical therapy in   . 
 You go to therapy to get better 
 when you're injured. 
 I 
 am 
 injured. 
 You 
 were. 
 You're not anymore. 
 Living with a physical disability 
 is not like living with, like, cancer. 
 You're not dying. You're not sick. 
 I see a healthy, fully capable 
 woman sitting across from me. 
 At some point, 
 you need to start seeing 
 yourself like that, too. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You were right. 
 About the wander bracelet. 
 Andrews was looking at me. 
 Are you just saying that 
 to make me feel better? 
 - Did it work? 
 - No. 
 When I was a junior in high school, 
 I made this vision board. 
 Two horses, Olympic medal in archery, 
 tour with NSYNC. 
 All goals that I'm okay 
 with not accomplishing, but... 
 Being a surgeon, getting married, 
 having kids? 
 One of those is already off the table, 
 and the others feel like 
 they're sliding out of reach. 
 I just... I feel like there's 
 this huge hole in my life. 
 You had a vision board? 
 There he is.

 of your anomalous anatomy. 
 So you're going to have to make 
 a lot of decisions in the moment? 
 Oh, at least six. 
 Where's Dr. Powell? 
 Off the case. But she will be replaced. 
 I want her back, 
 challenging every decision you make. 
 Her challenges have not been useful. 
 Israeli Intelligence refuses 
 to make any major decisions 
 until they are thoroughly 
 challenged by the Tenth Man, 
 a person assigned to raise 
 every possible pitfall 
 before proceeding. 
 I have a successful business 
 because of it. 
 If you can't work with a Tenth Man, 
 I'll find a surgeon who can.

 There is nothing good about Powell. 
 Really? 
 If there is, 
 I don't know how to find it. 
 Common ground. 
 Find the... the... the common ground. 
 My father-in-law, for instance. 
 We were like frozen Popsicles 
 in a... in a freezer. 
 - Popsicles? 
 - Metaphor. 
 We were so uncomfortable 
 around each other. 
 He didn't like me, I didn't like him. 
 And then, on Maddie's 
 fifth birthday party, 
 my father-in-law 
 pulled out a deck of cards 
 and performs, to perfection, 
 this magic card trick. 
 I'd been fumbling over 
 that same card trick for years. 
 I used to have a magic show. 
 Amazing Aaron's... Magic Show. 
 And from that point on, 
 we thawed out, you know? 
 And we were never close, 
 but we were okay around each other. 
 Common ground. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING]

 It was two months 
 before I scored in a game. 
 Ugh, I won't be able to move my

 -   for  , Doc. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - You're a doctor? 
 - Pediatrician. 
 I play much better against the kids. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Just for the record, 
 I did not love that. 
 No? Then why are you smiling? 
 It's more of a grimace. 
 Oh? Maybe. 
 Or maybe it's nice. 
 You know, being treated 
 like a normal person again. 
 That patronizing politeness 
 accorded to the helpless, 
 vulnerable invalid? 
 That crap gets old fast. 
 [CELL PHONE CHIMES, BUZZES] 
 Same time next week? 
 Not a chance in hell. 
 Okay. 
 And I'm back on the case. 
 I didn't know you were off it. 
 Figure you can use these 
 more now than I can. 
 Already lost one generator, 
 and the other is on its last legs. 
 ICU and OR are the only places 
 with working AC. 
 The whole hospital 
 could go dark at any time. 
 You're gonna fire me, aren't you? 
 Not if the board fires me first. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I got to make some calls. 
 Number six. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Lung is clear. Moving on. 
 Give her a bump of Dilt. 
 We don't want her heart going haywire 
 while we're trying 
 to pull this thing off of it. 
 Renal parenchyma isn't clear. 
 I can't resect this aspect of the tumor 
 without sacrificing the kidney. 
 Take the kidney. 
 Well, she'll need full-on dialysis. 
 She'll be looking 
 at blood-pressure volatility, 
 fainting spells, 
 electrolyte imbalances... 
 She can live with it. Take the kidney. 
 When my grandfather 
 got pancreatic cancer, 
 my grandmother pushed 
 his doctors to operate. 
 And complications from surgery 
 cost him everything that 
 made his life worth living. 
 Now, he could have spent 
 his last few months 
 in palliative care with his family. 
 Instead, he got three years 
 of pain and misery. 
 Now, we stop now, she'll have 
 a few more good months. 
 Butterscotch pudding. 
 Life is hard. 
 Sometimes the pain of loss 
 or whatever is so acute, 
 you don't know how 
 you're gonna go on or why. 
 And then you find a reason 
 or a reason finds you. 
 Someone needs you. 
 You find love, a purpose. 
 Dialysis isn't going 
 to stop Edna from the joy 
 of seeing her granddaughter 
 or the rustling of the leaves, 
 or butterscotch pudding. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I'll take the kidney. 
 Brooks' unstable angina has worsened. 
 The surgery can't wait. 
 Do you watch The Weather Channel? 
 This is San Jose. There is no weather. 
 Other than today. [CHUCKLES] 
 Helsinki has a lot of weather. 
 You watch Finnish weather reports? 
 I find using science as a 
 predictive tool very reassuring. 
 I've seen some good weather movies. 
 Twister, The Day After Tomorrow... 
 Those movies are very unrealistic. 
 - Sharknado. 
 - Pancakes. Do you like pancakes? 
 Not much of a carb person. 
 I do love banh xeo. 
 Vietnamese crepes, 
 stuffed with pickled daikon radish... 
 No, those are not pancakes. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We have no common ground. 
 Dr. Glassman's advice is not useful, 
 nor Lea's advice. 
 I still do not like you. 
 [GROANS SOFTLY] 
 That's every senior care 
 facility within a five-mile radius. 
 Alamitos? 
 Vista Park? 
 Edenvale? 
 Any of those places ring a bell? 
 Where's my Emma? 
 I'm gonna end up in Edenvale, aren't I? 
 With no one to report me missing. 
 No, you're not. 
 Edenvale's far too exclusive. 
 Come on. You know you're gonna 
 get back together with Park. 
 Sam? 
 Someone just called our ER 
 looking for a   -year-old Samuel 
 McIntyre of     Meadow Drive. 
 [EXHALES SLOWLY] 
 We really did kidnap him. 
 His grandson Kyle

 Solar energy company's 
 delivering a battery truck ASAP, 
 which would give us 
 all the power we need. 
 That's fantastic. 
 Except we can't access it. 
 It's DC power, 
 and they don't have an inverter. 
 MRIs run on DC. 
 They must have inverters. 
 I'm not sure they can 
 integrate it into our grid. 
 Well, we're gonna find out. 
 Have engineering take an inverter

 I was hoping to implant the

 - It won't reach.

 I was about to say that. 
 Sorry. Sorry. 
 We could do a bypass

 The graft would clot.

 We can try to conceive again. 
 Mm-hmm. I have an appointment

 Stay. 
 It wouldn't be fair to the patient. 
 [FILE THUDS] 
 Each of your babies gets their 
 own dedicated team of doctors. 
 Now, since all of the babies 
 will be under two pounds at birth, 
 they will all need 
 a lot of care, attention, 
 and time in our NICU, 
 maturing those lungs. 
 Once they're feeling strong 
 enough to make some demands, 
 you'll hear that beautiful cry. 
 A baby crying is a good thing. 
 It lets us know the baby's healthy. 
 And that's when we name them, 
 once they've cried 
 and we know they're okay. 
 I wish they could stay inside 
 Mom longer and get bigger. 
 Baby F's airway mass is already causing 
 severe narrowing of the trachea,

 Dr. Barnes will deliver 
 Baby F's arm and head

 leaving the placenta attached. 
 And, Mom, that allows you to keep

 Yep. Mama's giving her

 Nice work in there. 
 Baby C should be crying in no time. 
 Are you sure you want to

 Because I'm too careerist

 Like I was too ambitious

 No. 
 You'll love your kid 
 more than any job or partner. 
 I sure do. 
 But if you don't have the guy

 I shouldn't have a kid

 Okay, caveman.

 And then, when I did, I thought, 
 ""Oh, yeah. I remember this. 
 It's awesome."" 
 It's a first date. I'm not 
 even thinking about sex. 
 Liar. 
 These make these chairs that glide. 
 And wedges. 
 This is not a death sentence 
 to your sex life. 
 Okay, I will text him back, 
 mostly to stop this conversation. 
 - Hmm. 
 - But it's just dinner. 
 - For now.

 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Damn. She's not tolerating 
 the colostrum. 
 I haven't started it yet. 
 So you guys ready to start trying again? 
 Oh, yes. We put up 
 a calendar this morning. 
 And practiced. 
 I think she gets it, Shaun. 
 Visualizing the uterine wall. 
 [WARBLING] 
 That's scar tissue. 
 That sounds bad. 
 It's from the fetoscopic surgery 
 and D and C after your miscarriage. 
 You should do a hysteroscopy 
 to remove the adhesions. 
 Thank you, Dr. Murphy. 
 He's right. 
 Uh, we can attempt that, but... 
 You have Asherman's Syndrome. 
 Most likely, yes. 
 Well, can... Can we still start trying? 
 I wouldn't advise it. 
 How much longer do we have to wait? 
 I recommend continuing birth control. 
 Getting pregnant right now 
 wouldn't be safe for you 
 or the baby. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 When will it be safe? 
 Maybe another year? 
 Maybe two. 
 Maybe never. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Severe edema, 
 fluid in the lungs, but no obstructions, 
 just as we expected. 
 So we've eliminated brain, spine, 
 abdomen, anything congenital. 
 I shouldn't have let you talk to them. 
 Miracles? Really? 
 I was direct and honest. 
 How's that being honest? 
 They think there's a chance here. 
 As long as she's breathing, 
 her heart is beating, 
 her brain is functioning, 
 there's still hope. 
 This infant is under two pounds, 
 eleven weeks premature, 
 with a major birth defect. 
 She's more than likely too small, 
 too weak, and too sick to survive. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Stop being a cheerleader. 
 Start being a doctor. 
 O  sats and heart rate are improving. 
 Come on, dude. Cry for me. 
 You got this. 
 Who's a star? 
 Baby B is. He's coming off the vent. 
 Yes, you are. 
 And then you're gonna wail. 
 Those guys you were looking at earlier, 
 how much do you really know about them? 
 You'd be surprised. 
 Well, besides their physical 
 attributes and what diseases they carry. 
 Genetics can also determine 
 your sense of humor, your values... 
 You want me to have the sperm bank 
 ask them all to write a knock-knock joke 
 and an answer to the trolley problem? 
 Or ask me. 
 I'm not suggesting I'd be the kid's dad. 
 I just want to help. 
 No strings attached. 
 Uh, Baby B's on CPAP. O  sats rising. 
 Hope to hear a cry soon. 
 Excellent. Still no cry from C, either? 
 Okay. Scope the baby. 
 TAPVR repair may 
 have caused vocal cord palsy. 
 [DR. LIM] No missed 
 or new obstructive issues. 
 Upper airway's clean. 
 Why are her O  sats plummeting? 
 Could be some sort of fistula, 
 bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
 RDS. 
 Or it could be neurological. 
 She's too fragile 
 to start testing blind. 
 I'll stay with her. 
 Put her back on CPAP. 
 I'll put together a full differential. 
 Eat something while you're at it. 
 Marrow transplant seems to be working, 
 but I couldn't pass 
 the NG tube into the stomach. 
 How'd the appointment go? 
 Not well. 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 How long has he been drooling? 
 I don't know. 
 I... thought that was normal. 
 - It's not. 
 - Any luck with the NG tube? 
 No. That is a symptom. 
 This baby cannot swallow. 
 He has a congenial 
 tracheoesophageal fistula. 
 We need to operate. 
 Camera is in position. 
 [PEREZ] Fistula's between the 
 distal esophagus and the trachea. 
 You were right. 
 I know. Now reconnect the esophagus. 
 [PEREZ] Forceps. 
 [SHAUN] Repositioning thoracoscope. 
 [PEREZ] Got it. 
 Mobilizing the esophagus 
 to the level of the trachea. 
 Have you already isolated the fistula? 
 [PEREZ] Yes. 
 [SHAUN] I didn't tell you to do that. 
 - Uh... 
 - You should have first mobilized 
 the proximal pouch of the esophagus. 
 I'm s... I'm so... I'm sorry. 
 You may have interrupted 
 the blood supply. 
 The risk of anastomosis leaks and 
 tissue breakdown are greater now. 
 Give me the instrument. 
 Step back. 
 Move. 
 Take the camera. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Suturing. 
 [PEREZ] Is he gonna be okay? 
 [SHAUN] I don't know. 
 When I said ""yes"" to dinner, 
 I didn't mean tonight. 
 Patience is not my greatest virtue. 
 I'm in the middle of this preemie case. 
 So you fasting until it's done?

 Roast chicken. 
 Oh. It's like the first time 
 you asked me out. 
 [JEROME] Mm-hmm. 
 She's breathing on her own. 
 [JEROME] Nice. 
 I don't envy anyone who has to 
 try to sleep 
 in a house with six infants. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - No matter how cute they are. 
 I feel that way about one. 
 Oh. 
 Are you opposed to kids? 
 I mean, not politically. 
 But? 
 I'm not sure I want any of my own. 
 Is that bad? 
 Being one of four, I... 
 I always saw myself with a big family. 
 Being one of eight, 
 pretty much why I don't want one. 
 Ice Cube, Guy Fieri, Tom Hanks.

 Opposite sides of the Bay. 
 That's why they have a bridge. 
 I can't believe you were

 Were you sitting on that side of 
 the field where Clark caught it? 
 Yep. You're distracted. 
 Want to walk me 
 through your case so far? 
 EXIT procedure for CHAOS. 
 Cyst was decompressed. 
 We weaned her off CPAP, 
 O  sats improved, 
 then started crashing. 
 Not sure why. 
 Pass me the ghost pepper sauce, 
 would ya? 
 Ooh. Feel like that stuff's 
 gonna burn a hole in my chest. 
 What if your preemie's 
 breathing troubles 
 aren't from above? 
 What if it's from below? 
 Diaphragmatic hernia. 
 Could allow the baby's 
 lower organs to protrude 
 into her chest, crowd her lungs. 
 If it started as a small defect, 
 we could easily miss it on ultrasound 
 with all the crowding in that womb. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Smart, handsome, 
 and 
 you brought me food. 
 I might actually let you 
 take me out on a real date. 
 This is a real date. 
 I mean, it will be once we kiss. 
 Then we should probably do that now. 
 My thought exactly. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [DR. LIM CHUCKLES] 
 [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Thank you for your offer. 
 But? 
 It would hurt too much to see 
 you every time I looked at my kid. 
 [LEA SIGHS] 
 The live birth rate in pregnancies 
 after Asherman's treatment is   %. 
 She should have mentioned that. 
 Yeah. I guess so. 
 And hysteroscopy 
 improves the odds of conception. 
 Our prognosis for conception 
 may still be very good. 
 I'm ""sending good vibes into the

 Thank you, Shaun. 
 Maybe later. 
 Right now I'm just very sad.

 Hypnagogia. 
 Thomas Edison believed the thoughts 
 generated as we drift off to sleep 
 were the most likely 
 to generate a breakthrough. 
 All right, Thomas Edison, 
 the Wizard of Menlo Park, 
 the same guy who believed 
 that if he sat on a goose egg, 
 he could actually make 
 the goose egg hatch. 
 There was an experiment 
 published in 
 Science. 
 Subjects tried to solve 
 a difficult math problem 
 late at night 
 while holding something heavy. 
 When they drifted off to sleep, 
 they dropped it, 
 and when they woke up, 
 they solved the problem. 
 Okay, when I go to bed tonight, 
 I'll cuddle with a barbell while 
 holding onto a light bulb. How's that? 
 Any breakthroughs on Baby E? 
 We've exhausted all our options. 
 We're moving on to ""watch and wait."" 
 We were just talking about hypnagogia. 
 The Edison sleep theory 
 from 
 Science 
 magazine? 
 Thought we might stay all night 
 and take turns waking each other. 
 - Well, that's... 
 - Absurd? Silly? Ridiculous? 
 I was gonna say that's better 
 than ""watch and wait."" 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You were right. Baby F 
 has a diaphragmatic hernia. 
 It didn't show up in the initial X-ray. 
 Anybody would have missed it. 
 It was Clay's idea. 
 I'm glad that I texted him

 You did not. 
 I did.

 - Hypnagogia! 
 - Ahh! What? 
 - The groin. 
 - What? 
 - What? 
 - The groin? 
 If we can't access the baby's chest, 
 we can check the groin. 
 If she has bounding femoral pulses... 
 It would indicate 
 a patent ductus arteriosus. 
 Which would explain the fluid 
 in her lungs and the... 
 the heart failure, which could 
 be fixed with a Piccolo Occluder. 
 Go get consent. And an aspirin. 
 Uh, wait. 
 What is it? 
 If we can't put the baby on her back, 
 how are we gonna insert the device? 
 I'll get comfortable.

 I gotta get inside and shower

 Hm. Or maybe you're settling 
 for whatever he'll give you. 
 When did the stomach pain begin? 
 A couple weeks ago. 
 I'm on my tenth day of Lupron, 
 so it could be the side effects. 
 We're hoping for an embryo

 Gotta take care of this mama. 
 Other than the pain, any other... 
 Emesis, fever, sweats. 
 [GROANS, INHALES SHARPLY] 
 Some tenderness and distension.

 She had a ruptured appendix.

 [GASPING] I'm okay. 
 [SHAUN] You are not. 
 There is an irregularly shaped mass 
 in the right-side pelvic region. 
 You need a CT, stat. 
 [MORGAN'S VOICE ECHOING] Can I help you?

 Um, I fell and hit my head.

 No. No.

 I... I had a couple drinks last night. 
 How did I get here? 
 [GROANS] 
 And we need a head CT to check 
 for brain bleed or skull fractures. 
 Oh, my stomach is... 
 How did you get this? 
 Okay, her abdomen is rigid 
 and distended. 
 Significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage 
 at left upper quadrant. 
 You're bleeding from your spleen. 
 We need to get you into surgery. 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I reviewed your patient's ultrasound. 
 The appearance of that 
 mixed-echogenic mass is unusual. 
 Yes. 
 - We... 
 - Keep me posted. 
 Ooh, you went to Rosalia's? 
 The breakfast burrito 
 with the spicy chorizo... 
 Try molten chorizo. 
 Totally worth the ulcer 
 I'm probably getting. 
 - Hard Stan. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 I have never been to Rosalia's. 
 I recommend it. 
 Your images are ready, Dr. Murphy. 
 There is the mass. 
 There's a ton of free fluid 
 surrounding the lesion. 
 Possible active bleeding and 
 invasion into adjacent organs. 
 She needs surgery immediately 
 for resection of the lesion. 
 How long have you had these? 
 My monster horns? 
 A few years. 
 But now they're making it hard 
 for my glasses to stay on. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I keep them hidden with my hair. 
 You are beautiful, 
 and you have nothing to hide. 
 But those glasses do need to stay put, 
 so I think we should 
 remove these growths. 
 Without shaving my hair 
 or leaving big scars? 
 Those are the only options 
 other doctors have given me. 
 Those doctors don't know my technique. 
 I'll make a tiny incision here. 
 It minimizes scars, and it'll 
 leave your hair intact.

 Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

 I'd say real personal connection 
 can be rare, invaluable, 
 whether the context 
 is romantic or platonic. 
 I'll see you inside. 
 [ASHER] There are tentacles 
 of scar tissue 
 reaching into every organ. 
 Multiple abscesses and infection burden. 
 We will need several drains. 
 cc already. This infection is crazy. 
 So, things with you and Lim 
 are still sorta awkward? 
 Dr. Lim and I have 
 a professional relationship 
 centered on medicine. 
 The mass is adherent to the pelvic wall, 
 colon, bladder, uterus. 
 But you guys used to be closer. 
 Do you miss that? 
 Cutting through more tissue. 
 Dr. Lim is Chief of Surgery, 
 I am an attending. 
 A medical focus is logical 
 and productive. 
 We've reached the mass. 
 Cutting into the capsule. 
 Wait. 
 Oh, my God, is that... 
 A surgical towel. 
 Have my special ex lap tray ready. 
 Transfuse two units and stay two ahead. 
 Place a Foley catheter now. 
 Her hematocrit's in the toilet. 
 A fall shouldn't have caused 
 this much damage. 
 [PEREZ] She was high when she came in. 
 No telling what could've happened. 
 How about we hold that judgment 
 till her tox results come back? 
 Placing arterial line now. 
 Sluggish pupils, memory loss, 
 confusion... she's using. 
 Not judgment, just recognize 
 certain behavior when I see it. 
 She's hemodynamically unstable. 
 Debate later. 
 Right now, we need to stop this bleed. 
 Dr. Allen, why aren't you 
 placing the catheter? 
 There's severe bruising 
 and signs of major trauma 
 in her pelvic region. 
 I think she was r*ped. 
 We were able to save your spleen, 
 but you bled a lot during the surgery 
 for reasons we don't understand yet. 
 We need to run more tests. 
 When we were placing your catheter, 
 we discovered some bruising 
 and signs of trauma 
 in your pelvic region. 
 We're worried you may have been 
 sexually assaulted. 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 No, that's... just not possible. 
 Your urine testing also came 
 back positive for Rohypnol. 
 It's often associated with date r*pe. 
 No, I-I... 
 I went out for drinks with my friend. 
 We were celebrating his new job. 
 I watched the bartender mix my drinks. 
 I was tipsy, but I wasn't drunk. 
 The bruises must be from when I tripped. 
 I would remember if 
 what you're saying happened. 
 Rohypnol can cause short-term amnesia. 
 I'm sure this information is a shock. 
 We're here to support you. 
 The best way to gather evidence 
 as to what happened is to do a r*pe kit. 
 No, I... I don't need that. 
 I was with my friend. 
 He wouldn't let anything happen to me. 
 You don't have to decide right now. 
 Get some rest. 
 We'll let you know when 
 your latest labs come back. 
 [SIGHS] 
 A retained surgical item? 
 It's a towel that was left 
 in you after a procedure. 
 It is adherent to several vital organs. 
 We could not remove it 
 without irreversibly damaging... 
 Left behind by who? My doctor? 
 Let's focus on getting it out 
 first, and then we can... 
 Who performed my appendectomy? 
 Broder, I think. But... 
 The count of sponges and other items 
 inside the surgical cavity is 
 done by the lead scrub nurse. 
 But you may discuss this later. 
 Okay. So who was the lead scrub nurse? 
 Gomez, maybe, or Kraus. 
 I really don't remember. 
 But 
 you 
 were definitely there. 
 Are you blaming this on me? 
 You were one of the nurses. 
 I mean, shouldn't you have noticed? 
 I was circulating, not scrub. 
 No way I was the one who did this. 
 A minute ago you can't remember, 
 but now you're sure you didn't do it. 
 - Maybe we should move on to... 
 - Why are you attacking me? 
 I just found out I have 
 an infected towel in my gut 
 that will require major surgery, 
 and you're making this about you. 
 You're acting like this was my fault. 
 It doesn't matter whose fault it was. 
 We will approach the towel 
 like a sarcoma... 
 perform an en bloc resection, 
 bypass any intertwined 
 vital arterial structures, 
 and finish with a thorough debridement. 
 I think that's a reasonable option. 
 Well, right now, your opinion 
 doesn't mean a lot. 
 I just need a minute. 
 I'll be out in the hall. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING]

 She's syncopal.

 Possible bleed or septic shock. 
 Crash airway tray! 
 An additional abscess cavity 
 in the towel may have ruptured. 
 We need to get her back to the O.R. 
 - You wanted to see me? 
 - Hey. 
 Yeah, I'm double booked tomorrow. 
 You'll be scrubbing in with 
 Dr. Annanian for Gwendolyn's surgery. 
 But she was so impressed with you. 
 She's really excited 
 to have you as her surgeon. 
 Well, it's a meeting I can't miss. 
 But Dr. Annanian has my surgical plan. 
 I'll check in afterwards. 
 The rupture caused 
 widespread peritonitis. 
 This infection is way worse than before. 
 Aggressively irrigate, 
 debride, and suction. 
 We need to control the infection. 
 Send tissue and fluid to the micro lab 
 so we can focus her antibiotics. 
 [ALARM BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 Big drop in BP. 
 Heart rate spiking. 
 She isn't tolerating surgery. 
 We need to close her again. Sutures. 
 Wait, what about the towel? 
 We can't operate until her BP 
 and O  sats are under control. 
 She'll need to remain sedated 
 and intubated until she stabilizes. 
 And we need to find a new 
 approach to removing the towel. 
 Once she's closed, 
 I can dive into research. 
 I will consult with Dr. Lim. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 I would like a surgical consult. 
 The Mukherjee case? 
 The mass on the CT was 
 a retained surgical towel. 
 And is acutely infected 
 and adherent to vital organs. 
 The patient blames her wife, 
 who was a surgical nurse 
 during the appendectomy... 
 circulating, not scrub. 
 If we could stick to the medical... 
 The patient didn't understand 
 the count was not 
 her wife's responsibility. 
 They argued quite a... 
 The most pressing issue is the 
 towel poisoning her from the inside. 
 What is your plan to remove it? 
 That... 
 is what I am here to discuss. 
 You are an attending, Dr. Murphy. 
 And your patient has a few hours 
 before she's stable enough 
 for any procedure. 
 Research RSIs and brainstorm 
 possible solutions with your team. 
 Then, if you still need 
 a consult, my door is open. 
 How's Toni's platelet count? 
 Still dropping. 
 Did you do an anti-platelet antibody? 
 Waiting on results. 
 Order another PRBC transfusion 
 to get her hematocrit up. 
 Any progress on the r*pe kit? 
 She doesn't want to talk about it. 
 I can't blame her. 
 It's an invasive process 
 that only serves to prove 
 something horrible happened 
 that she doesn't remember. 
 Her brain may not be able 
 to remember, but her body does. 
 And chances are, eventually, 
 it will all come back. 
 Shouldn't we respect her wishes? 
 I mean, we don't want her to feel like 
 she's being assaulted all over again. 
 Denying what happened doesn't 
 change the fact that it happened. 
 [CELLPHONES DING] 
 It's Toni... Code Gray. 
 [TONI CRYING] No, please, please, stop! 
 She woke up screaming, 
 and she pulled out her IV. 
 Just stay away from me! 
 We just want to help you. 
 Toni, you're okay. 
 We're here with you. 
 It's not real. 
 Can you breathe with me? 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY, SHAKILY] 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 You're okay. 
 You're not in danger anymore. 
 I... 
 had a nightmare. 
 Her gown. 
 I need to take a look at that. 
 Okay? 
 The spleen repair didn't work. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 [SHAUN] Over the course 
 of your long career, 
 you have removed five retained sponges. 
 That is statistically higher 
 than any surgeon in the region. 
 Special skill on my resume 
 right under juggling. 
 My patient has a retained towel 
 that has caused sepsis 
 with multi-organ involvement. 
 I would like a surgical consult. 
 Perfect request 
 for your department head. 
 Dr. Lim said I should tackle 
 the problem on my own. 
 Well, that's interesting. 
 She is right. I am an attending. 
 But your RSI experience would 
 be very helpful on this case. 
 All right, I'll take a look. 
 Thank you. 
 Nurse Villanueva, 
 why is Gwen's surgery 
 still on my schedule? 
 She panicked when I told her 
 it'd be another surgeon. 
 - She really wants you. 
 - Assure the patient 
 she's in great hands with Dr. Annanian, 
 and take her off my rotation. 
 No. 
 You told her you'd do the surgery. 
 You can tell her that 
 you're not going to do it. 
 What about a minimally 
 invasive surgery... 
 cutting up the towel, removing it 
 piece by piece through a single port? 
 That won't work. 
 Where it's stitched to the organs, 
 the infected tissue 
 puts her at high risk. 
 An aggressive gross total 
 resection of all organs invaded 
 by the towel plus all infected 
 and necrotic tissue 
 is the best option 
 for long-term survival. 
 That procedure risks major bleeds, 
 and we'd have to remove her uterus. 
 They're planning a family, and 
 Naveen is supposed to carry the baby. 
 That will also be impossible 
 if she is dead. 
 That's elegantly put. 
 The wife of the patient is here, right? 
 Explain the options to her, 
 and see how she wants us to proceed. 
 They had an argument 
 before her last surgery. 
 She will not be pleased with 
 her wife making that decision. 
 Just go talk to her. 
 We figured out why you've been bleeding. 
 You have a condition known as ITP. 
 Your immune system 
 is destroying your platelets. 
 Can you fix it? 
 There is medication that can help. 
 And we need to remove your spleen. 
 Why didn't you just do that 
 during my earlier surgery? 
 We weren't aware of your ITP. 
 It's a condition that 
 can be triggered by trauma. 
 The ITP complicates our approach. 
 Usually, we'd remove your 
 spleen through your abdomen, 
 but that risks a catastrophic bleed. 
 We can remove your spleen 
 vaginally with minimal incisions. 
 There's less risk of bleeding. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Okay, let's do it. 
 I'm hoping you'll let us do a 
 r*pe kit before the procedure. 
 I already told you, no. 
 [SCREAMING] 
 The transvaginal approach will destroy 
 all evidence of the sexual as*ault. 
 No. 
 I don't care. 
 Without the kit, you'll have no proof. 
 [GLASS SHATTERS] 
 You're right. 
 I believe that something 
 terrible happened to me. 
 But that is true whether or not 
 I go chase down the boogeyman. 
 But it could help. 
 Nothing will help. 
 Don't let whoever did this 
 to you get away with it. 
 He already has. 
 Doing a r*pe kit 
 is not going to unrape me. 
 Go ahead with the surgery. 
 We need your decision. 
 Is there any way to do 
 the total resection 
 without removing Naveen's uterus? 
 No. 
 She's dreamed of being pregnant 
 her whole life. 
 I can't choose this for her. 
 You can. 
 We understand how difficult this is. 
 - She'll never forgive me. 
 - She will. 
 I mean, it's obvious Naveen loves you. 
 She already blames me 
 for what's happening. 
 If I'm the one that takes away 
 her chance to carry a child... 
 You are right. 
 If you choose the gross resection 
 and your wife loses her uterus, 
 it is likely she will never forgive you. 
 But that is irrelevant. 
 This is your decision. 
 You have to make it. 
 Whatever happens next. 
 Do the total resection. 
 I haven't seen you around here 
 for a while, huh? 
 Forgot how relationships 
 can eat into discretionary time. 
 Doesn't exactly sound like a complaint. 
 It's not. 
 Shaun came to me 
 with a surgical consult. 
 Your RSI record. Smart. 
 He did it because you sent him away. 
 Well, part of the Chief's job 
 is to empower their attendings 
 to find their own solutions. 
 Sounds like Shaun did. 
 A lot of ways to empower an attending. 
 And I chose one. 
 Because you're still angry with Shaun? 
 - Okay. 
 - How long are you gonna keep that up? 
 How about as long as I want? 
 Okay, you be as mad at Shaun 
 for as long as you need to be. 
 Thanks for the permission. 
 Just so you know, it's toxic. 
 And not just for Shaun. 
 Spare me. 
 You're not concerned for anyone 
 other than Shaun. 
 I have to get back to work. 
 Dr. Andrews. 
 I rescheduled my finance meeting. 
 But in the future, 
 I'm requesting a scrub nurse 
 who respects my role 
 as surgeon and hospital president. 
 When I was in the hospital, 
 you sat at my bedside. 
 You helped me recover 
 when I wasn't sure I wanted to. 
 That meant a lot. 
 Personal attention 
 with patients is important 
 even when you're president. 
 The laparoscopic splenectomy 
 is a great alternative 
 to the transvaginal... 
 Toni's surgery is already 
 scheduled for this evening. 
 And she asked that you be 
 removed from her case. 
 She may regret not taking 
 action on this for the rest of her life. 
 That's her decision, not yours. 
 I got your message, Shaun. 
 What's so urgent? 
 I have added you 
 to Naveen's surgical team. 
 Please get ready to scrub in 
 in    minutes. 
 You have a surgical plan 
 in place, Shaun. 
 You're perfectly capable of 
 executing that plan. 
 It is my responsibility as attending 
 to create the conditions most likely to 
 result 
 - in a positive outcome. 
 - Which you've done. 
 Which include the presence of 
 a surgeon with RSI experience. 
 Shaun, you're... you've always 
 been confident in... in the O.R. 
 [SCOFFS] What is this about? 
 Having a surgeon with 
 relevant experience present 
 in case I need advice. 
 - Well, what if I'm busy? 
 - You're not. 
 What exactly about this case 
 is so concerning... 
 You have more RSI experience 
 than any surgeon in this hospital. 
 That is why I would like you 
 in this surgery. 
 Please? 
 All right, fine. I'll be there. 
 Please get changed. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I can't reach the highest point 
 from here. 
 Best way to hide the scars 
 is to go in above her hair line. 
 We'll need to shave some of her hair. 
 Maybe not. 
 Someone get me a comb. 
 Moving on to the hysterectomy. 
 Please clamp the uterine horns. 
 Grasping round ligament, midway 
 to the inter... internal inguinal... 
 Infection of the muscular layer 
 of the uterine wall has reduced. 
 Maybe we can save her uterus. 
 Shaun? 
 Come on. 
 Shaun. 
 Stick to the plan. 
 You cannot save the uterus. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 Okay. 
 You are right. 
 Necrosis is too advanced. 
 Transfixion sutures and hemoclip. 
 Hey. 
 I wanted to see how you're doing. 
 Naveen is recovering well. 
 The surgery turned out as expected. 
 You hesitated in the O.R. 
 What was that about? 
 I wanted to save her uterus. 
 Why'd you get stuck on 
 not doing the hysterectomy? 
 The patient wants to carry a child. 
 Well, that's very empathetic. 
 I guess you... you developed 
 a personal connection? 
 Luna made the right decision 
 even if her wife will never forgive her. 
 Are you worried that 
 this will hurt their marriage? 
 It doesn't matter, okay? 
 It doesn't matter. 
 What matters is that she is alive. 
 We saved her life. 
 Well, that is one thing that matters. 
 So is losing a personal connection... 
 No, the medicine is... 
 Shaun, is this about Lim? 
 What... What about her? 
 I don't know. I just... It's... 
 Lim is still up... upset with you. 
 She's still mad at you. 
 D-Does that bother you? 
 Dr. Lim and I have 
 a professional relationship... 
 No. No, you don't. 
 And you need to fix that. 
 The two of you need to sort that out. 
 I don't know what you want me to do. 
 I want you and Lim 
 to talk to each other. 
 She does not want to talk to me. 
 That depends on what you have to say. 
 I have nothing to say. 
 Shaun, Lim is hurting, okay? 
 You are hurting. 
 Tell her that. 
 I mean, maybe... 
 maybe she'll forgive you. 
 Maybe... Maybe she won't. 
 I don't know. 
 But the two of you have to resolve this 
 for both of your sakes and mine. 
 Dr. Lim and I have 
 a professional relationship. 
 I do not need to talk to her. 
 I have to finish my op note now. 
 I've never done a splenectomy 
 that way either. 
 Cool surgery, 
 not the coolest circumstances. 
 Our patient went through 
 something terrible 
 and my initial reaction 
 was to judge her... 
 same way people judge me. 
 Don't beat yourself up. You didn't know. 
 You're a good friend. 
 I know. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 But... 
 I've been waiting to be more than that, 
 and I don't think 
 I should do that anymore. 
 I'm gonna take a rain check on research 
 and reschedule my date. 
 I think that's good. 
 You deserve to be happy. 
 [CELLPHONE DINGS] 
 I have to go prep Toni. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I owe you an apology for pressuring you. 
 I didn't do a r*pe kit. 
 And I've always regretted it. 
 And I didn't want you to feel the same. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I was in medical school. 
 He was a friend of a friend. 
 Somewhere along the way, 
 he became a stalker. 
 One night he showed up 
 at a bar I was at. 
 He followed me home. 
 I hated the idea of being seen 
 as a victim... 
 ...so I never told anyone. 
 I let that creep go. 
 And now I'll never know 
 how many other women he hurt. 
 But that's my regret. 
 And it's not fair to put that on you. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 [CRYING] 
 I knew he liked me. 
 I should have made sure 
 that he knew it wasn't a date. 
 I shouldn't have had a drink. I... 
 I don't even know 
 if I told him to stop. 
 What if I didn't? 
 It is not your fault. 
 He took away your choice. 
 And now you have to do 
 what's best for you, 
 whatever that is. 
 Toni, time for surgery. 
 Not yet. 
 There's still a little swelling, 
 but you'll have minimal scarring. 
 They're gone. 
 Now those glasses will stay put. 
 Nice job with my braids. 
 Wasn't me. 
 Always wanted a daughter, 
 so I learned to braid. 
 Well, you might've found 
 a nice side hustle. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Thank you, Dr. Andrews. 
 You're welcome. 
 Are you okay to continue? 
 Yes. 
 Are you okay to continue? 
 Yes.

 Are you okay to continue?

 Naveen, in the process 
 of removing the towel, 
 we also had to take your uterus. 
 We're so sorry. 
 There was no other way? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Yes, but I told them... 
 I told them to do it. 
 I needed you to survive. 
 Because you mean everything to me. 
 And I failed at my most important job... 
 keeping you safe. 
 I failed you five years ago in the O.R. 
 and again yesterday. 
 I was so focused on defending myself, 
 I wasn't thinking about 
 what you were going through, 
 how scared you were. 
 And I'm so, so sorry. 
 Whatever you need, 
 if... if you want me here 
 every step of the way, or... 
 out of the picture completely... 
 You better be here 
 every step of the way... 
 ...because I love you 
 more than anything, too. 
 I'm sorry. 
 How's she doing? 
 Surgery went well. 
 Her platelet count is turning 
 in the right direction. 
 Good. 
 And beyond the physical? 
 Too early to tell. 
 Recovery's a process. 
 All that time we were together, 
 why didn't you tell me? 
 Because I don't need anyone's pity, 
 yours included. 
 It's in the past. 
 What you did for Toni, 
 that was really brave. 
 I'm here if you ever need 
 someone to be brave for you. 
 Thank you. 
 I need to talk to you 
 about your surgery. 
 I can't change what happened, 
 and I do not owe you an apology. 
 Dr. Murphy. 
 But I am sorry for other things. 
 In my RSI surgery today, 
 the medical choice was clear, 
 but I did not want to proceed 
 because I knew what 
 the consequences would be. 
 In your surgery, 
 the medical choice was clear, 
 and I did proceed, 
 but I did not know 
 what the consequences would be. 
 I saved your life, 
 but my decision also caused you harm. 
 When I saw you hurt and bleeding... 
 I saw my brother Steve, when he died. 
 When I thought I might lose you 
 the way I lost him, I did not like that. 
 I am sorry... 
 this... 
 has been very hard for you. 
 A medicine-only relationship 
 is... is not easy. 
 I... 
 It is not what I want. 
 I have missed your friendship. 
 I have missed you. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 This has been... 
 really hard. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 And my life is in a good place now. 
 I'm happy. 
 But 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 still angry sometimes. 
 It may take a while to let that go. 
 But... 
 I've missed you, too, Shaun. 
 Hey. 
 You know, I love being the boss, 
 but connecting with patients 
 is the reason I got into 
 medicine in the first place. 
 And you made me remember that. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Could I buy you a drink 
 as an apology for being a pompous ass? 
 - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 - No. 
 Unless you throw in 
 some wings and fries. 
 Tough negotiator. 
 You know it. 
 Shaun came to see me. 
 We talked. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 Join me? 
 I'm sure we can find some cucumber water 
 around here somewhere. 
 Late dinner with Clay. 
 Good night. 
 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 Good night. 
 What was that? 
 I don't know. 
 - You're back. 
 - Yes. 
 You told me I was isolating 
 myself in my other office. 
 Shaun, there's something 
 you should know. 
 Lim, when she was in her chair 
 and adjusted her position, 
 there was flexion and rotation 
 in the psoas and in the glutes. 
 There was movement. 
 She could walk again."

 It could be expensive

 Hey, why don't you do 
 your thing with the real estate agent? 
 I'm gonna go wander.

 Tori Vargas. Any questions? 
 Oh, yes, I have many. 
 About school districts,

 Someone came prepared. 
 Does that include

 - If not, I can help. 
 - Oh, no.

 and sometimes, 
 there are cookies. 
 How fun! 
 Uh, excuse me just a sec. 
 Hi, there. 
 I grew up with a reading nook 
 just like this one. 
 I'd lay in a pile of pillows, 
 watch the falling snow. 
 That sounds... uncomfortable. 
 A lot of the work 
 is just cosmetic. 
 I could do most of it myself.

 Yes, ma'am.

 Mm! Did I forget 
 an anniversary? 
 This is a thank-you for 
 planning our first road trip. 
 Mm! 
 I'm planning more road trips. 
 I can't wait 
 to head south on PCH. 
 Last trip was a solo one 
 on my Ducati. 
 Hold on. 
 You're a biker chick? 
 Was. In another life. 
 You miss it? 
 The other life? 
 Motorcycles are too dangerous. 
 You could end up paralyzed. 
 Nice deflection. 
 I didn't know you 
 in the other life. 
 I like this one. 
 Still feel that way

 We haven't had a chance 
 to talk about...

 Great. 
 I barely heard a word he said,

 I was thinking about our kiss. 
 It was... It was amazing. 
 Yes, it was. 
 Look, I like you, 
 but I need some clarity here. 
 Right. 
 Let me be clear. 
 How about I make you dinner 
 tomorrow, my place,

 where we're headed? 
 Sounds good. 
 It's a date then. 
 A date. 
 Oh. 
 Good morning, Dr. Lim. 
 Did Clay stay over last night? 
 - He did. 
 - Excellent. 
 That means you are likely in a good 
 mood and amenable because of the sex. 
 Amenable to what? 
 I think you will like it. 
 There was movement, 
 flexion, and lateral rotation, 
 which means that there was 
 engagement with the psoas

 You could walk again. 
 Audrey, this approach 
 is much safer 
 than the one 
 we discussed last time. 
 I need time to think it over. 
 Of course. 
 Okay, today is the first day I will

 it is a major improvement.

 My new system has over 
 50 unique metrics 
 that go into your scores. 
 Everything you do 
 will be assessed. 
 Everything? Uh, could you be 
 a bit more specific? 
 No. 
 Is this like 
 a head-to-head competition? 
 It's designed to make you aware 
 of your individual 
 strengths and weaknesses. 
 Residents with more strengths 
 are more likely 
 to get invited back 
 for a full residency. 
 Hi, Teddy. Dr. Powell. 
 What happened to your head? 
 I idiotically smacked myself 
 with a 20-pound kettle bell. 
 Kettlebell injuries 
 are surprisingly common. 
 My gym has a printout 
 of ten different ways 
 you can hurt yourself. 
 Did you witness the accident? 
 Yeah. I'm there 
 for all his workouts. 
 Oh, so you're his trainer. 
 His brother. 
 My baby brother. 
 He's got a real knack 
 for making me suffer. 
 All right. 
 We're gonna run a full 
 concussion protocol 
 and get a CT as a precaution. 
 Not until 
 we take care of this gash. 
 You're also experiencing 
 abdominal pain. 
 - Did that pain start... 
 - Aah! 
 ...before or after 
 you hit your head? 
 Uh, kind of simultaneous? 
 Do you mind lifting your shirt? 
 Teddy, you've recently 
 lost a lot of weight. 
 Seventy pounds. 
 In five months. 
 Getting that summer 
 beach bod ready. 
 Keeping the T-shirt on for now. 
 Teddy, do you mind 
 if we laid you back 
 just to get a better look? 
 Oh, got a lump. 
 An inguinal hernia. 
 It's not reducible. 
 I think it's also strangulated. 
 Hmm, Dr. Perez is right. 
 The blood flow to your herniated 
 intestine has been cut off. 
 You need immediate surgery. Okay. 
 This is Lily. 
 37, dizziness, epistaxis, 
 purulent nasal discharge. 
 Let's get full labs 
 including blood cultures. 
 I guess the upside 
 of dating a doctor 
 is no waiting in the ER. 
 I dated a guy at the DMV 
 for that very reason. 
 Do you have a history 
 of nosebleeds? 
 Yes. 
 Part of my perpetual 
 sinus infection. 
 I've been on and off 
 antibiotics for a year. 
 I figured it's because 
 I teach Kung Fu to kids. 
 Mm, adorable. 
 Do you feel any sinus pressure? 
 Also, how'd you two meet? 
 Yes, and Bumble? 
 Thank you, Dr. Reznick. 
 I got this. 
 He's worried this will be 
 awkward because I'm his ex. 
 Don't worry. We're friends now. 
 Any other recent symptoms? 
 I've had a few migraines 
 and bad taste 
 in my mouth recently. 
 Temp's elevated, 
 and she's hypertensive. 
 Acute-on-chronic 
 bacterial rhinosinusitis? 
 Probably, 
 but given the headaches, 
 I want a stat 
 brain and sinus CT 
 with and without contrast. 
 Hernia is reduced. 
 Next step in the tension-free 
 hernioplasty? 
 Use mesh 
 to cover the fascial defect. 
 By strengthening 
 the inguinal floor, 
 we hope to prevent 
 further hernias. 
 No extra credit will be given 
 for statements of the obvious. 
 It's impressive how much 
 weight Teddy's lost. 
 I just hope he's doing it 
 for the right reasons. 
 Hard to see a wrong reason. 
 He was clearly 
 pretty overweight. 
 I agree. 
 Obesity increases 
 health risks for diabetes, 
 heart disease, 
 and some cancers. 
 Fair. But our culture can really 
 go overboard on the fat-shaming, 
 which can lead to 
 low self-esteem, depression, 
 none of which is healthy. 
 Trying to change to please 
 someone else rarely works. 
 Getting someone you love 
 to do what is best for them 
 is a good thing. 
 There's ectopy in the EKG. 
 QT looks prolonged. 
 Push 2 grams IV of magnesium. 
 He's going into torsades. 
 Proper response? 
 Synchronized cardioversion. 
 Yes. Prepare to shock him. 
 Charging 200 joules. Clear. 
 Good catch, Dr. Powell. 
 I caught 
 the strangulated hernia. 
 Teddy's arrhythmia is likely a 
 sign of an underlying condition. 
 It could be quite dangerous. 
 Next, you will be assessed on 
 how quickly and accurately 
 you can determine 
 what's causing it. 
 Suture scissors. 
 I'll start with the sinuses. 
 Hey, I found you 
 a new prospect. 
 Unless your last date was a 
 love connection for the ages. 
 - That's a no. 
 - Oh. Hmm. 
 How terrible for him. 
 How exciting for me. 
 Berkeley law grad, 
 former fitness model, 
 just moved back 
 to the valley from Paris. 
 Thanks, but I'll pass. 
 That's severe opacification. 
 Sinus mucosa's thickened. 
 There's already bony erosion. 
 Lily needs endoscopic 
 sinonasal debridement. 
 He's smart, he's ripped, 
 he's worldly, 
 and unlike Perez, 
 he's available. 
 - We kissed. 
 - What? 
 You and Perez? 
 Yeah. 
 What about his 
 recovery-related boundaries? 
 I haven't figured that out yet, 
 but he did invite me 
 to dinner at his place. 
 I'm exploring. 
 Just be careful, okay? 
 Okay. 
 Her sinus infection spread 
 through her skull base. 
 That's a massive 
 6x4 centimeter abscess. 
 Page Park. If that 
 thing ruptures, she'll die. 
 Lily needs sinus 
 and brain surgery. 
 Sinus debridement 
 looks very good, Dr. Allen. 
 Pulling the scope. 
 Bacitracin-coated Telfa. 
 And we use two burr holes to drain 
 the abscess using ultrasound guidance. 
 So, 
 how'd you get approval 
 to operate on your 
 new girlfriend? 
 Two dates does not equal a 
 girlfriend. No approval necessary. 
 Trajectories look good. 
 Drainage tool. 
 Plus or minus that you got to 
 parade her in front of Morgan? 
 Definitely not parading, 
 and Morgan and I are... 
 friends, so neither. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Mm, this is as much 
 as I can get 
 without risking rupture 
 into the ventricle. 
 Eh, the rest is up 
 to the antibiotics. 
 Leave the drain and close. 
 Would you say 
 you loved, liked, or hated 
 the last house we saw? 
 Are those the only options? 
 I should examine your hand. 
 Oh, it's fine. 
 I can't stop thinking 
 about the crown molding 
 and the reading nook, 
 so as long 
 as you don't hate it, 
 I'm thinking we should 
 talk to a mortgage broker 
 about making an offer. 
 You said going to open houses 
 was only for fun. 
 I've looked at our finances, 
 and we can swing it. 
 Rent is spent. 
 A mortgage payment is... 
 whatever rhymes with payment 
 and... 
 And means good investment. 
 My research shows 
 we should adhere 
 to the 28/36 rule with regards 
 to monthly pre-tax income. 
 You have swelling around 
 your second digit's metacarpal 
 and the proximal phalanx 
 of your thumb. 
 Okay, I've done worse 
 on engine blocks. 
 Shaun, we can be homeowners. 
 Doesn't that 
 excite you even a little? 
 Hmm. 
 I am a little excited 
 that you are excited. 
 Good, because I made 
 an appointment 
 with a mortgage broker. 
 And you guys can talk 25/36. 
 Twenty-eight. 
 You know, it's silly 
 for us to be competitive. 
 Said the loser while losing. 
 Olive branch. 
 I don't know what's 
 causing the arrhythmia. Do you? 
 I have ideas. 
 O-kay. 
 So you can present them 
 and land the knockout blow... 
 if you're confident 
 that you're right. 
 - Or? 
 - Or we can bounce ideas off each other, 
 get the right answer, 
 and help this guy. 
 For all we know, 
 one of Dr. Murphy's metrics 
 is cooperation 
 amongst colleagues. 
 Fine. 
 But I present. 
 Do you have any idea 
 how often women 
 get zero credit 
 for their ideas, 
 even when they come 
 out of their mouths? 
 Fine. 
 Blood sample showed critically 
 low potassium and sodium, 
 which makes no sense 
 given the power-food diet 
 that his brother's got him on. 
 There's plenty of nutrients. 
 - So maybe celiac. 
 - Mm. 
 IgA and IgG antibody tests 
 were normal. 
 I'm thinking 
 primary aldosteronism. 
 That's interesting. 
 Please present your ideas on what 
 is causing our patient's arrhythmia. 
 We think that Teddy 
 has primary aldosteronism. 
 Explains initial 
 electrolyte levels and... 
 That doesn't align with urine 
 studies or lack of hypertension. 
 This was your idea. 
 Congenital long QT syndrome. 
 Teddy's QT levels 
 have returned to normal, 
 and he has no family history. 
 He has critically low levels of 
 potassium, sodium, and magnesium. 
 I noticed that. 
 Despite a good diet. 
 It suggests absorption and... 
 What happened to cooperation 
 amongst colleagues? 
 I didn't realize 
 you were gonna be wrong. 
 Slight enamel erosion 
 on the molars 
 and trauma to the oral mucosa. 
 And these tiny abrasions on 
 his knuckles are from his teeth. 
 Self-induced vomiting 
 led to malnutrition, 
 which caused the arrhythmia. 
 Teddy, you are bulimic. 
 That's quite the cocktail. 
 Not the kind I was hoping 
 we'd share, but here we are. 
 Not exactly what I would 
 have worn either. 
 We're hoping the antibiotics will 
 clear the remaining infected areas 
 of your sinuses and brain. 
 I feel like I'm already getting 
 the VIP treatment from you. 
 Dr. Reznick was right. 
 She said your flower game 
 was very solid. 
 She stopped by? 
 Yes. 
 Ostensibly to check on me, 
 but mostly 
 to sing your praises. 
 Not many guys 
 have an ex as a hype man. 
 Lucky me. 
 I think it's too soon 
 to discharge Teddy. 
 He has responded well 
 to electrolyte replacement, 
 there are no signs 
 of recurrent arrhythmia, 
 and the hernioplasty only 
 requires simple wound care. 
 - He's bulimic. 
 - I know. 
 I diagnosed him, thank you, 
 after you and Dr. Powell 
 failed to. 
 Eating disorders have the highest 
 mortality rate of any mental illness. 
 I referred him 
 for a psych consult 
 and provided a list of clinics 
 for eating disorders. 
 He needs help now, 
 not in a few weeks. 
 Give me some time. Maybe I can get 
 psych to talk to him before he leaves. 
 Points are given 
 for passion and commitment 
 and taken away for arguing 
 with an attending. 
 I don't care about the points. 
 We can't keep him hospitalized 
 without a clear 
 surgical indication. 
 Stop hounding me. 
 I'm having a coffee. 
 Can I have a coffee? 
 You're hovering. 
 I'm excited about the prospect 
 of getting you 
 back on your feet. 
 This surgery 
 is not an easy decision. 
 The surgical plan 
 is a very good one. 
 Yes, it's a solid plan. 
 But? 
 But my life is good right now, 
 really good. 
 Better than it's been 
 in a while. 
 And the idea of that 
 changing is... 
 Lea said we would go to 
 open houses as a fun hobby, 
 but now she wants to buy one. 
 - Shaun, I'm in the middle of a... 
 - No, you're not. 
 A house? 
 Okay, well, congratulations. 
 Look at you two, grown-up-ing. 
 No, it's a fixer-upper. 
 Dr. Glassman, I don't like it. 
 Did you tell Lea that? 
 No, she is excited when she talks 
 about the house. It makes her happy. 
 And I think 
 she has been sad lately. 
 Why has she been sad? 
 I told you, 
 we have to wait to get pregnant 
 because of her 
 Asher man's syndrome. 
 Well, maybe Lea is looking for 
 a way to move you two forward. 
 You think if we buy that house, 
 Lea will be less sad? 
 I don't know, but, you know, 
 buying a house can be exciting. 
 It's a distraction. 
 Distractions can be useful. 
 No, no, no. 
 I do not like distractions. 
 Shaun... 
 You've been rating residents 
 for quite a while now, 
 and now all of a sudden, 
 you revamp your entire system? 
 When did you decide to do that? 
 Mm, after the sextuplets 
 were born. 
 Wasn't that 
 around the same time 
 you found out about 
 Lea's Asher man's? 
 Yes. 
 We were both very sad. 
 You think my new system 
 was a distraction? 
 Yeah, and... and now 
 maybe Lea needs one. 
 Oh, excellent idea. 
 Thank you, Dr. Glassman. 
 Brought your ride outta here 
 and your discharge papers. 
 Pulled some strings, 
 got you a psych consult 
 at an eating-disorder clinic 
 day after tomorrow. 
 Thanks, but I'm good. 
 This hospital stay 
 was the wake-up call I needed. 
 You don't have to 
 go through this alone. 
 Discharge party. 
 I brought drinks. 
 Special Potassium Powerhouse 
 for my big bro. 
 So, um, Teddy tells me 
 he has some, like, 
 freak electrolyte deficiency? 
 Do you know what caused it? 
 Teddy's got 
 all the information. 
 Do I need to make 
 any adjustments to his diet? 
 It might be a good time to dial 
 back on the weight-loss goals. 
 Uh, why? 
 Simon, uh, let's just go. 
 Is it dangerous 
 for him to diet now? 
 For how long? 
 Um, I-I-I can't really say. 
 Simon, forget it. 
 It's on me 
 to make sure you're okay. 
 No, it's actually not. 
 It's my life. 
 Why are you getting mad at 
 me? I'm just being supportive. 
 Otherwise known as 
 micromanaging everything I do. 
 You were miserable 
 and a mess, okay? 
 I'm the one 
 getting you healthy. 
 What am I missing? 
 Tell him. 
 It wasn't your workouts 
 that took off the weight. 
 I've been... 
 purging. 
 Making myself puke. 
 Is that what caused 
 your heart thing? 
 Why would you 
 do something so stupid? 
 Maybe because you're so obsessed 
 with me not being a fat embarrassment. 
 - I never said that. 
 - You didn't have to. 
 You've never been so excited 
 as when I mentioned 
 maybe losing some weight. 
 - Because I'm worried about you? 
 - You're ashamed of me. 
 It's been years 
 since we've hung out, 
 and now every day, 
 you're all over me 
 to meet you at the gym. 
 You're k*lling yourself, 
 but this is my fault? 
 Get your own ride home. 
 I don't want to micromanage. 
 Sim... 
 Teddy, I am so sorry. 
 It's fine. 
 I can Uber. 
 - You sent her flowers from me? 
 - You're welcome. 
 Have you considered that I may 
 not even want to keep seeing Lily? 
 She's clearly a keeper, 
 and you need a girlfriend. 
 How is that your business? 
 Because I need 
 you and I not to make 
 the same mistake 
 all over again. 
 We both know we've been teetering 
 on the edge of falling back into us. 
 You're out of your mind. 
 Like you haven't 
 thought about it? 
 You read too much 
 into my friendly gestures. 
 Like offering me your sperm? 
 For IVF. 
 Could the symbolism 
 be any more heavy-handed? 
 We can't go back. 
 You made it very clear 
 that I'm not what you wanted, 
 and I haven't changed. 
 So I need you to move on. 
 - How long? 
 - It's just over a minute. 
 We pushed 2 milligram 
 IV lorazepam. 
 And the antibiotics 
 clearly aren't working. 
 Push another 2 lorazepam. 
 Why do you look like you just 
 watched the first two minutes of Up? 
 I thought Teddy 
 wasn't gonna get 
 the help he needed 
 for his bulimia. 
 I thought maybe his meddling 
 brother might make sure he did. 
 Not a bad plan. 
 The execution was... flawed. 
 So congratulations on your 
 upcoming blowout victory. 
 Help! Someone call the RRT. 
 I got it. 
 Teddy. 
 He's ruptured his esophagus. 
 Page Dr. Murphy and prep an OR. 
 Chest tube placed. 
 The lung drainage is orange? 
 What's left of the smoothie. 
 Advance the endoscope. 
 He is fortunate that you 
 responded so quickly, Dr. Perez. 
 I pushed Teddy to admit 
 his bulimia to his brother. 
 They fought, 
 and then he did this. 
 Oh. That was... 
 not helpful. 
 And there is too much damage 
 for a primary 
 esophageal repair. 
 We can place an endoscopic 
 stent, wait until edema improves. 
 It will leak. 
 What about 
 using omentum as a patch? 
 The tissue is too friable. 
 It's usually for kids, but what 
 about gastric transposition? 
 We could resect 
 the damaged esophagus 
 and reconstruct it 
 using stomach tissue. 
 Good idea, Dr. Perez. 
 This will improve your score. 
 We need to open him up. 
 The abscess is not responding 
 to the antibiotics. 
 The sinus infection 
 is still seeding to the brain. 
 We could drill 
 an additional burr hole, 
 get more aggressive 
 with the drainage. 
 The same approach 
 will get you the same results. 
 Thanks for 
 the unhelpful cliche. 
 Lily needs 
 a bifrontal craniotomy 
 with sinus exenteration. 
 Remove the skull base 
 on both sides, 
 then rebuild it 
 to stop bacterial entry. 
 I'm not taking off Lily's 
 forehead and consigning her 
 to years 
 of reconstructive surgeries. 
 You want to save her life 
 or protect her pretty face? 
 Are you seriously accusing me 
 of acting unethically 
 because I've been 
 on two dates with her, 
 after your move with the flowers? 
 - What move with the flowers? 
 - Shut up. 
 I'm accusing you of letting your 
 medical judgment be clouded 
 because you don't 
 want to agree with me. 
 I'm making the right call 
 for the patient. 
 Disagreeing with you 
 is an unrelated bonus. 
 Get Lily and the OR prepped. 
 Removing the devitalized 
 segment of the esophagus. 
 We've got a good plane 
 of healthy tissue. 
 Dr. Perez, 
 you may perform the two-layered, 
 inverted, hand-sewn anastomosis. 
 I had a I-late night 
 on a research project. 
 My hands aren't stable enough. 
 Dr. Powell should take this. 
 Starting to suture. 
 I am ready to go home. 
 I am not, 
 thanks to Andrews dumping 
 reconfiguring 
 the remote interface in my lap. 
 It's weeks, if not months, 
 of debugging code. 
 Well, that was fast. 
 When I asked Dr. Andrews to assign you 
 a new project, he could not think of any. 
 How is your hand? 
 Annoy... Annoyed, along with the 
 rest of me. Why would you do that? 
 Because you have been sad 
 that we have to wait to have a baby. 
 Work will be a much better 
 distraction than restoring an old house. 
 That's not a judgment 
 for you to make, Shaun. 
 I'll pick my own distractions. 
 And I have been sad. 
 And that house is just a chance 
 to make something broken 
 beautiful again. 
 So is reconfiguring 
 the remote interface. 
 The house feels like 
 a step forward. 
 I can really see us being happy 
 in that home, Shaun. 
 I just... wish you would 
 try to see that, too. 
 Okay. 
 Okay we can make an offer? 
 No, I meant, okay, I will try. 
 Thanks. 
 I'll see you at home later. 
 Sorry I'm late. 
 I had an impulse. 
 NBA 2K. 
 Prepare to get smoked. 
 Mm. Tip-off will have to wait. 
 I'm buried. 
 Maybe I could help? 
 Trouble with a case? 
 Yeah. 
 My own. 
 What's happened? 
 Glassman found movement 
 in my psoas and glutes. 
 He and Murphy found 
 an endoscopic solution. 
 They'll de-tether your 
 spinal cord. That's great. 
 Is there a problem 
 with the surgical plan? 
 It's quite elegant. 
 Then what's holding you back? 
 I feel like we've been 
 living in this bubble, 
 this perfect bubble, 
 and if I step outside of it, 
 it will pop. 
 This surgery... 
 would change you, 
 not us. 
 What we have 
 isn't going to disappear 
 if you walk again. 
 You need to believe that. 
 I want to. 
 Please. I can't be the reason 
 you say no. 
 We successfully repaired 
 Teddy's distal esophagus 
 with reconstructed 
 stomach tissue. 
 Teddy will be able to eat 
 and swallow normally, 
 but any further purging 
 will cause irreparable damage. 
 I thought we were 
 finally close again. 
 He's been hurting, and I... 
 I had no idea. 
 How do I fix this? 
 Sometimes... trying to fix 
 the problem is the problem. 
 I went through 
 some tough times, too, 
 and plenty of people 
 had ideas about how to fix me. 
 See, I didn't... 
 I didn't need that. 
 I just needed them... 
 to love me, 
 broken or not. 
 Even though 
 I don't like sanding 
 and paint is sticky 
 and smells terrible 
 and power tools 
 are loud and dangerous, 
 I am positive that we, 
 mostly you, 
 can make that fixer-upper 
 into a beautiful home... for us 
 and the family we will have. 
 Are you saying 
 we should buy the house? 
 If it will make you happy. 
 I bulldozed you, didn't I? 
 Yes. But I do not mind. 
 But I do. 
 I'm being selfish. 
 Thank you for letting me. 
 But the only step forward 
 I need right now 
 is one we make together. 
 Let's find a place 
 we both love. 
 That is a good approach. 
 And, also, let's get my hand 
 checked out. It does really hurt. 
 Advancing 
 into the abscess. 
 Couldn't stay away? 
 Lily is 
 my patient. I admitted her. 
 Resecting last bits of capsule 
 from the abscess cavity. 
 Got it. Pulling the scope. 
 Heart rate's 32. BP, 210/122. 
 Her brain is starting to 
 herniate out of the burr holes. 
 Give 100 grams mannitol, 
 burst suppress high-dose propofol. 
 That won't be enough. 
 Get her CO2 below 30. 
 I'm aware. 
 Place an EVD. 
 - Should we pivot to the bifrontal craniotomy? 
 - No time. 
 Can you connect the burr holes 
 and run a small craniotomy flap? 
 No, but a hemicraniectomy 
 will reduce the brain pressure. 
 And then you can debride 
 the skull-base infection. 
 - Good. 
 - Good. 
 Mm, that was hot. 
 Doing this surgery 
 is a good decision. 
 - I hope so. 
 - Doubts? 
 No. I'm a little nervous, 
 but no doubts. 
 Thank you both 
 for not giving up. 
 You're welcome. 
 We'll see you in recovery. 
 Welcome back. 
 You've got a visitor. 
 You're okay? 
 Getting there. 
 No gym for a while. 
 You need time to heal. 
 I'm on it, doc. 
 Remember when we were kids, 
 you made me watch 
 Alien vs. Predator? 
 I had to let you sleep 
 in my room for three months. 
 Turns out, the combined 
 Alien/Predator canon includes 13 movies. 
 You and I are gonna 
 watch them together. 
 If that's cool with you. 
 Sounds stupid. 
 But fun. 
 Looks like both brothers 
 are on the mend. 
 Take video. Maybe Murphy 
 will give you some points. 
 I'm good. 
 What happened in the OR when 
 you handed over the anastomosis? 
 Just didn't feel like my day. 
 I devised my 
 first-year-resident rating system 
 as a distraction. 
 It was very complicated and 
 encouraged too much competition. 
 So I have decided to retire it. 
 You okay? 
 Easily the worst date 
 I've ever been on. 
 Well, the next one, I'll put 
 the rest of your skull back on. 
 We have to wait until the swelling 
 in your brain has gone down. 
 Am I gonna be okay? 
 You've got a long road ahead, 
 but yes. 
 And you won't be alone. 
 That's a lot of commitment... 
 especially when you and 
 Dr. Reznick don't really seem done. 
 Thanks for everything... 
 Dr. Park. 
 I'm glad you didn't move on... 
 from the case. 
 Glad you listened. 
 I'm working on it. 
 Lily will be lucky to have you 
 through her recovery, 
 unless you decided 
 not to see her anymore. 
 You were right. 
 She's a keeper. 
 Then I'm happy for you two. 
 Visiting hours still open? 
 They don't usually 
 let visitors into pre-op. 
 Well, nobody says no 
 to a guy in a wheelchair. 
 I had to see you. 
 I recognize this is terrible 
 timing and kind of bonkers, 
 but I couldn't let you 
 go in before asking. 
 Audrey... 
 Will you marry me? 
 Definitely bonkers. 
 I don't expect an answer now. 
 This? This is me telling 
 you that I am all in. 
 Thank you. 
 That's my cue. 
 I'll be waiting. 
 Do I look as silly 
 as this feels? 
 Ms. DiLallo? 
 We're gonna 
 have to postpone your CT.

 [ANDREWS] It's been three months. 
 The man's a saint. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I have been recovering 
 from a major surgery 
 and re-learning to walk. 
 Your recovery's remarkable. 
 So is your procrastination. 
 I am taking the time to consider 
 the biggest decision of my life. 
 Clay's fine. 
 No man... no 
 person... 
 is fine waiting this long 
 for an answer to that question. 
 Ever done one 
 of whatever this is before? 
 No. You? 
 Mm-mm. 
 I've been clean for  days. 
 I went to rehab for two months, 
 and I go to meetings every single day. 
 I don't know if you two 
 can ever trust me again, 
 but I am willing to do whatever it takes 
 to earn back my place here. 
 And we'll do everything we can 
 to support you in your recovery. 
 But our number-one obligation 
 is to our patients. 
 For their safety and yours, 
 we need to put some guardrails in place. 
 You'll be on probation for six months. 
 You cannot prescribe or administer 
 any controlled substances. 
 You will be given random drug tests, 
 and every step of your patient care 
 will be supervised by the 
 Senior Resident on your case. 
 Today that is Dr. Allen. 
 You okay with those terms, Dr. Perez? 
 Absolutely. 
 I'm just happy to be here. 
 How are you? 
 Better. 
 A lot better. 
 I hadn't heard from you. 
 Which is totally understandable. 
 I just wasn't sure... 
 I didn't know what to say. 
 You're not the reason that... 
 that happened. 
 As your supervisor on the case, 
 I will oversee your charting, 
 your patient interactions, 
 double-check your med orders. 
 And this. 
 [DR. WINKLER] Fetal movement is good. 
 Heart rate is normal at . 
 I've been monitoring 
 the heart rate daily. 
 It ranges from  to  BPM. 
 Her last emesis was three weeks ago. 
 So the nausea's getting better. 
 - Great. 
 - And the fatigue. 
 Less improvement on 
 the constant state of terror. 
 You made it through the first trimester. 
 - You're doing great. 
 - Mm. 
 You two want to know 
 the sex of the baby? 
 - Yes. 
 - No. Don't look. 
 It'll be a fun surprise. 
 Oh. 
 It is fun to be prepared. 
 [KEYS CLACKING] 
 Oh. 
 What's going on? 
 [DR. WINKLER] 
 There is a small, thinning area 
 on your uterine wall. 
 It is slightly hypoechoic, 
 likely a result of the scar 
 tissue from your prior surgery 
 and Asherman's syndrome. 
 Is that bad? It sounds bad. 
 Mm. 
 If it progresses, 
 your uterus could rupture 
 and we would lose the baby. 
 But it's very possible 
 the lining will remain stable 
 and your pregnancy 
 will progress normally. 
 What happens now? 
 We'll put you on bed rest 
 and monitor you closely. 
 You're wrong. 
 There may be a surgery 
 that can fix this. 
 I need to talk to Dr. Lim 
 and Dr. Glassman. 
 Hello. I have admitted Lea 
 for close monitoring 
 and a follow-up MRI, 
 which detected a small amount 
 of free fluid in the abdomen. 
 This, plus a slight decline 
 in the hematocrit, 
 increases the likelihood 
 of rupture by % to %. 
 Shaun, I'm so sorry. 
 How are you and Lea holding up? 
 Oh. Fine. 
 I found a surgery to fix it. 
 I have spent the last three months 
 researching every complication 
 of Asherman's syndrome. 
 I discovered an experimental procedure 
 to reinforce the uterine lining 
 with collagen fleece 
 that will expand as the uterus grows. 
 I have studied the technique, 
 and I will teach you how to do it. 
 How many times has 
 this procedure been done? 
 Five. Three had good outcomes 
 and the babies were carried 
 to full term, 
 and the odds are better for Lea 
 because you are above-average surgeons. 
 [GLASSMAN] Shaun, 
 I don't need to remind you, 
 but this procedure can induce labor 
 and can cause major bleeding. 
 You could lose the baby. 
 If we wait and the uterus ruptures, 
 we will definitely lose the baby 
 and Lea could suffer 
 a catastrophic hemorrhage. 
 Due to the size of the uterine window, 
 there's a good chance it won't. 
 No, with Lea's prior surgery 
 and the significant scar tissue, 
 I put the likelihood of rupture 
 at close to %. 
 Those chances... 
 not good. 
 Lea's body, her call. 
 [MORGAN] Drew Dewitt. 
 Has recurrent desmoid tumors 
 caused by Gardner's syndrome. 
 The one on his liver is benign, 
 but it hasn't responded to chemo. 
 It's encroaching on the stomach 
 and spleen. It has to come out. 
 Thus, the surgical consult. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 He has almost no small intestine. 
 He needed a major resection a year ago. 
 He's been living off 
 IV nutrition ever since. 
 I've treated him for post-op infections 
 and pain management over the last year. 
 I've never seen this much 
 scar tissue in a patient. 
 How many surgeries has he had? 
 . Plus  rounds chemo 
 and  hospital stays. 
 Unfortunately, we have to add 
 one more surgery to that list. 
 Will this surgery affect his 
 place on the transplant list? 
 We've been waiting over a year 
 for a small bowel. 
 Apparently, I'm ""too healthy"" 
 to move to the top. 
 It shouldn't, barring long-term 
 infection or other organ damage. 
 When you're ready, 
 we can take you to pre-op. 
 - You got this, D. 
 - You know it. 
 [LEA] I have no idea. 
 [SHAUN] Would you like us to go over 
 the risks and benefits again? 
 No, I know everything 
 that could go wrong. 
 All I can see is what can go wrong. 
 You don't have to decide right now. 
 We can continue to monitor. 
 If we wait, the uterine window 
 could expand 
 and make the surgery more risky. 
 Now is the safest time. 
 Don't pressure her, Shaun. 
 Okay. Okay, I know I trust you. 
 So if you think surgery is the 
 right decision, then we should do it. 
 On one condition. 
 I want you in the OR. 
 Not for me, but if something 
 were to go wrong 
 and we lose our baby, 
 I need you to be with her. 
 Or him. 
 With my guidance, I think 
 there is a very good chance 
 our baby will be fine. 
 Mm. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Forceps and Metz. 
 How's it feel to be in the OR again? 
 Very good, sir. 
 We're all very glad to have you back. 
 We've exposed the surface of the liver. 
 Tumor's invaded the liver 
 capsule and parenchyma. 
 That's twice the size 
 it appeared on imaging. 
 If we take out all of the tumor, 
 he'll only have half a liver left. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 Ultrasonic dissector for resection. 
 Make sure to approximate the edges 
 so it overlaps with the uterine window. 
 I internalized that the first 
 three times you told me, Shaun. 
 I'm sorry you and Lea 
 are going through this. 
 Mm. Dr. Lim was able 
 to place the fleece patch 
 seven seconds faster. 
 But your laparoscopic 
 suturing technique is superior. 
 You will be in charge of that. 
 Practice it now. Please. 
 Shaun, I've done it a million times. 
 You have never done them on my wife. 
 Fair point. 
 [MORGAN] Because we had to 
 take more of your liver 
 than we'd hoped, your 
 liver function is declining. 
 Getting your nutrition through 
 an IV is tough on your body. 
 The TPN that's keeping me 
 alive's also k*lling me? 
 That's gnarly. 
 So, what's the alternative to TPN? 
 How do we get him nutrients? 
 We're looking into it. 
 For now, we're gonna 
 manage your symptoms 
 and keep you stable until a 
 small bowel becomes available. 
 There's no way those organ cops 
 can say I'm too healthy now. 
 I'll order cholestyramine 
 for the itching 
 and liver function testing 
 every few hours. 
 I'll call UNOS 
 and do whatever I have to... 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 ...to get him moved up the list. 
 Where you sneaking off to? 
 I'm walking down the hall, 
 in plain sight. 
 The alarms, the pills, 
 the classic Morgan evasion techniques. 
 You're getting your embryos 
 implanted, aren't you? 
 Congrats on cracking 
 that already wide-open case. 
 I have to give myself 
 a time-sensitive injection now, 
 then yell at some 
 nice transplant people. 
 Why didn't you tell me? I could help. 
 I'll refer you to the minutes 
 of our previous meeting... 
 ""We need boundaries."" 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 I remember you put on my 
 hospital socks for me last time, too. 
 I hate that we have a routine. 
 This time is different. 
 - Hi. 
 - I love you. 
 How are you? Do you need anything? 
 There's Funfetti cake in Pedes 
 for Nurse Hawks' birthday. 
 Do you want me to get you a piece? 
 Just this is great. 
 Please leave. 
 Having visitors increases the risk 
 of perioperative infection, 
 and stimulation 
 can raise blood pressure, 
 which increases the risk of 
 intraoperative complications. 
 I need to do your pre-op exam. 
 - [GROANING] 
 - [ALARM BEEPING] 
 He just doubled over. 
 My gut is trying to k*ll me. 
 Please, can you give him something? 
 I'll up his morphine. 
 Check the site for infection. 
 Hang on. You're gonna be okay. 
 Dr. Allen, his wound dehisced. 
 What does that mean? 
 His muscles couldn't hold the stitches. 
 It tore open. 
 [BREATHING RAGGEDLY] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Move the patch three 
 millimeters to your right. 
 It should overlap with the wound margin. 
 - Got it. 
 - Yes, there. 
 That is good. 
 [GLASSMAN] Dr. Wolke, 
 take the scope, please. Sutures. 
 - Prolene sutures 
 in the myometrium defect 
 need to be placed 
 exactly one millimeter apart. 
 Dr. Murphy, take one more step, 
 I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. 
 Applying the glue. 
 No, no. That's too far. 
 - The view is obscured. 
 - Shaun. A little to your left. 
 [ASHER] She's bleeding. 
 No signs of rupture. 
 You may have placed the sutures too deep 
 because you didn't have a clear view. 
 The sutures are fine. 
 I should take over. 
 Shaun. 
 There, 
 a small bleed underneath the patch. 
 Must've nicked a vessel. 
 I'll clip it. 
 Suction. 
 Okay, we can continue to close. 
 Yes. Lea and the baby are fine. 
 In spite of the avoidable errors. 
 His abdominal wall 
 is too weak and damaged 
 from prior surgeries 
 to hold the sutures. 
 We covered the wound with plastic, 
 but we need to take him back to the OR 
 and close him up 
 before it gets infected. 
 The tissue will just tear open again. 
 His skin and muscles need time 
 and nutrition to heal. 
 I have a small bowel for Drew. 
 Drew's wound dehisced. 
 We can't take that organ. 
 I'm not turning it down. 
 This is Drew's only chance. 
 Tell UNOS we need to 
 run some more tests. 
 Buy us a few hours. 
 That's how long we have to figure out 
 how to stitch this kid back together. 
 What about component separation? 
 That could weaken the tissue even more. 
 Right. 
 Maybe a four-step Fabian procedure. 
 Except Drew doesn't 
 have time for four steps. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Hi. 
 Here to check Lea's post-op vitals. 
 I also brought supplements. 
 Mm. 
 Thank you. 
 All right, your post-op 
 ultrasound looks good. 
 Oh. 
 Fetal movement and heart tones 
 are great. 
 Oh, thank God. 
 When can I go home? 
 You need to be here for monitoring 
 for several more days. 
 I can't go days like this, Shaun. 
 I hate it here. 
 You are here for work every day. 
 Not in this room, in this bed, 
 thinking about everything. 
 Jerome and I can visit 
 on our lunch break. 
 Oh, we could take the ""What 
 Yankee Candle Are You?"" quiz 
 that's on page . 
 Rest will help you recover faster 
 so you don't have to be here anymore. 
 Her ultrasound does look good. 
 Thank you. You can go. 
 Thank you. 
 UNOS called again. 
 I told them we have to re-run 
 Drew's liver function test 
 and get a CT scan. 
 I bought us an hour at most. 
 What about a Sure-Closure device? 
 Too high a risk for ventral hernia, 
 which could lead to us needing 
 to resect his large intestine, 
 leaving him even worse off. 
 I already played it out. 
 [SIGHS] 
 For your embryo thing, 
 you know, whenever that is, 
 I can give you a ride, if you need one. 
 I'll get an Uber. 
 You really want to go to 
 the most important appointment 
 of your life with a stranger in a Camry? 
 I've chosen to do this alone, 
 and I'm fine with it. 
 And I'm... I'm trying very hard 
 not to care about what 
 anyone else thinks about that. 
 So having you imply how sad it is 
 that I have to take a cab 
 to a doctor's office 
 is not helpful. 
 [CELLPHONE BEEPS]

 [GROANING LOUDLY] 
 He threw up, and his pain 
 is getting worse. 
 He's already maxed out on morphine. 
 I'm overriding. 
 [PARK] There's increased 
 redness and swelling on the edges. 
 Early signs of infection. 
 I love you, Mom. 
 - You're gonna be fine. 
 - It's okay. 
 We knew we'd get here someday. 
 I'm ready. 
 No. 
 I am not giving up on you. 
 Don't give up on me, D. 
 Please. 
 [BREATHING RAGGEDLY] 
 Oh. I-I will take those. 
 They're from all the nurses. 
 We just want you both to know 
 that we're thinking about you. 
 I will pass that along. 
 But not these. 
 Baby's breath has 
 a strikingly unpleasant odor. 
 Is there anything you need? 
 We're fine. 
 Uh, 's family is on their way in. 
 Heads up... they are a loud bunch. 
 They're very excited 
 to be taking Meemaw home. 
 I don't think Lea's fine. 
 She's lonely and bored, 
 and being back in that room 
 is bringing up 
 a lot of painful memories. 
 And I know you're just... 
 you're trying to protect her, 
 but... 
 but it's making you 
 kind of a pain in the ass. 
 Your wife, who's carrying 
 the tiny human, 
 she needs her loud bunch. 
 People asking how she is doing 
 and being worried 
 will only make Lea worry more, 
 and that is not helpful. 
 Not for you, 
 but I think Lea needs more 
 than just you right now. 
 She needs lots of people 
 showing concern and love. 
 And maybe you do, too. 
 More than you think. 
 ♪ I think of when... ♪ 
 [LIM] Question for you. 
 Does it bother you that this 
 has been sitting here 
 for three months? 
 No. 
 - Does it bother you? 
 - No. 
 I'm feeling a little pressured. 
 I've barely brought it up. 
 And I appreciate that. 
 [SIGHS] 
 But it sitting here is kind of pressure. 
 It was meant to be a cute gesture. 
 A subtle... 
 Not so subtle reminder 
 that the offer is still ""on the table,"" 
 which has clearly 
 overstayed its welcome, 
 and the last thing I want 
 is for it to come between us. 
 Are you un-proposing? 
 No, I'm un-pressuring. 
 I love you, and I'm not going anywhere. 
 When you're ready, 
 we'll put it back on the table. 
 What about a Velcro biocompatible patch? 
 It would facilitate 
 his granulation tissue growth. 
 How do we keep it from adhering 
 to other organs? 
 Yeah. 
 [SIGHS] 
 This should be turmeric chicken 
 with asparagus. 
 That's what I was gonna 
 make you for our date. 
 And after work, all I had to do was 
 go to the store and get some chicken. 
 But instead, I-I texted my dealer. 
 For a thousand reasons, 
 none of which excuse 
 nor explain anything. 
 You don't owe me an explanation. 
 I do. 
 And I wish I could give you one. 
 Every day for the past  days, 
 I've asked myself, 
 ""Why didn't I just go get the chicken?"" 
 I mean, we would have had 
 a great dinner. 
 I mean, you would have been 
 funny and beautiful. 
 And I would have tried 
 way too hard to be charming. 
 And then... 
 ...who knows? 
 I'd give anything to go back, 
 start over. 
 Give us a clean slate. 
 Me too. 
 What if we did that for Drew? 
 What if, along with a new bowel, 
 we gave him a whole new abdominal wall? 
 Clean slate. 
 Has it ever been done before? 
 Not exactly. 
 I'm gonna look down and see... 
 someone else's abs? 
 Replacing it is the only way to 
 get you a new small bowel. 
 You'll be able to eat again. 
 You'll get stronger. 
 What are the chances it'll work? 
 It's never been done in tandem 
 with another transplant. 
 There are increased risks 
 of rejection or infection. 
 But both organs are in great 
 shape and a good match. 
 It's our best shot to save your liver 
 and give your body time to heal.

 Thank you so much. 
 [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] 
 Okay. 
 Well, let's do this.

 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 If we don't keep quiet, 
 Shaun is gonna come down on us 
 with the hammer of Thor, okay? 
 It's so nice to laugh. 
 Enter Shaun with a chest plate 
 and a red cape with the Mjolnir. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 I don't want to get kicked out 
 before I know... 
 boy or girl? 
 I have to start scoping out 
 the latest baby fashions. 
 I don't know. 
 I don't want to know. 
 Last time, when we found out 
 we were having a girl, 
 Shaun and I were choosing her name. 
 I liked Sage and Skylar and Sofia. 
 Something with an ""S,"" 
 after my grandma, Susie. 
 And then she was... gone. 
 And I can't do that again. 
 Maybe you should tell Shaun about this. 
 He's already so worried, 
 no matter what he says. 
 And what if talking about it just... 
 I have something for you. 
 Mm? 
 My faith. 
 Not just in God. 
 I have faith in the surgery you had. 
 I have faith in you and Shaun, 
 and that your baby, 
 whatever it is, 
 is going to be okay. 
 Your -minute visit has run over. 
 I have to scrub in anyways. 
 Pencil me in for the next 
 -minute opening, Thor. 
 Thank you. I-I needed that. 
 [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 Mmph. Pfft. 
 But not that. 
 I kind of feel nauseous. 
 We should do another ultrasound. 
 Mm. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [GROANING LIGHTLY] 
 This surgery could buy you 
 a year, maybe more, 
 give you back some quality of life. 
 But... 
 it should be what you want. 
 You're  and you've suffered more 
 than some people their whole lives. 
 No one would fault you 
 for deciding you're done. 
 I can't. 
 Your mom has given you 
 all the support in the world, 
 but this is your fight. 
 Do you want to keep going? 
 The worst part about 
 all of this is knowing 
 one day, it'll end, 
 and my mom will be alone. 
 She's been with me through all 
 the hardest parts of my life, 
 and I won't be around when she has 
 to go through 
 the hardest part of hers. 
 If I can put that off, 
 if even for a little bit, 
 then I'm gonna do that. 
 And hope that makes 
 the days she'll face alone... 
 a little easier. 
 You're all set. 
 We'll take you to surgery soon. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 I love you. 
 And whatever happens... 
 you don't need to worry about me. 
 I'll be okay. 
 I love you, too, Mom. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 [SOBS] 
 [SHAUN] She was feeling nauseous, 
 so I did an ultrasound, 
 which detected increased 
 fluid in the abdomen, 
 but then she lost consciousness. 
 It is almost certainly 
 internal bleeding. 
 I'll scrub in, right away. 
 No, no, no. You can't come in. 
 This is likely a complication 
 - from the first surgery. 
 - Shaun... 
 It is my fault, and I need to fix it. 
 Shaun, if we can't stop the bleeding, 
 we may have to take Lea's 
 uterus in order to save her life. 
 If we get there, we're gonna 
 make the decision quickly 
 and with medical factors only, 
 no emotion. 
 Lea would want me in there 
 in case we lose the baby. 
 If that happens... 
 if 
 that happens, 
 I will come back and get you, I promise. 
 [LIM] Surgical site looks good. 
 Patch is intact. 
 No signs of acute placental abruption. 
 [GLASSMAN] Bladder's clean. 
 No blood coming from the 
 ovaries or the fallopian tubes. 
 And the bowel is intact. 
 It's gotta be coming from the uterus. 
 If we clamp the uterine vessels, 
 we may slow down the bleeding. 
 But we put the baby at risk. 
 If we don't stop it soon, 
 we're gonna put Lea at risk. 
 I'll clamp the internal iliac 
 on the side of the bleed. 
 Buys us some time. 
 Give two more units of blood 
 and stay four ahead. 
 Retractor. 
 [SHAUN] If the site is hemostatic, 
 they will look for placental abruption. 
 Next, they will check 
 the bladder, ovaries, 
 and fallopian tubes. 
 Shaun. 
 They can't clamp the uterine vessels 
 without hurting the baby, 
 but they can place 
 an atraumatic vascular clamp 
 on the internal iliacs, 
 which will slow down the bleed 
 while they try to locate it. 
 Once they stop the bleed, 
 they should be able to repair it 
 and be done by...

 The surgery went really well. 
 You should be able to start

 Better make sure my new

 No signs of infection. 
 We'll see how long that lasts. 
 One step at a time, D. 
 We'll let you get some rest. 
 No alcohol in that new gut of yours. 
 Not for four more years. 
 One step at a time, Mom. 
 Hey, I don't want to help 
 because I feel bad for you. 
 I feel bad for me. 
 You're gonna be an amazing mom 
 because you're amazing at 
 whatever you put your mind to, 
 and I'm a little conflicted, I guess, 
 because I won't be a part of it. 
 Making my single-mother 
 IVF journey about you 
 is uncharacteristically self-absorbed. 
 I'm impressed. 
 You changed me. 
 [CHUCKLES LIGHTLY] 
 And doing things alone isn't sad. 
 Still doesn't mean 
 you have to do them that way. 
 From here on, I'm gonna request 
 not to be supervised by you. 
 Why? 
 I didn't OD because of you, or us. 
 But I knew I couldn't be with you 
 if I wasn't okay. 
 So I convinced myself I was. 
 Jordan, if I let myself 
 get close to you, 
 I will fall for you again, and... 
 ...and I will want so badly to be okay, 
 to be ready for us. 
 I can't risk that.

 The echo results were that bad? 
 Your heart muscle's 
 deteriorating way too fast. 
 We don't have time to wait 
 for a matching donor, 
 so we're gonna fix the one you have. 
 We're going to remove the scar tissue, 
 use a synthetic patch, 
 along with your healthy tissue 
 to reshape your ventricle 
 over a balloon. 
 It's kind of like papier-mache. 
 If that's possible, 
 why didn't we do it sooner? 
 It's a challenging surgical technique. 
 Which makes it right 
 in Dr. Lim's wheelhouse. 
 But I'm confident it's the 
 best option for your situation. 
 This surgery is amazing. 
 How did you even come up with it? 
 I didn't. It's a modified 
 ""Dor Procedure""... 
 basically an endoventricular 
 patch plasty. 
 There's nothing basic about it.

 - Spare me. 
 - What?

 I am not stroking your ego. 
 I am sincerely... 
 Start with a DE MRI

 versus functional tissue, 
 while I finalize the surgical plan.

 Completely pristine images 
 of right ventricular scarring 
 without artifact or distortion. 
 No room for error on this. 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [JORDAN] There's a small mass. 
 Her pediatrician said it was a cyst. 
 He doesn't think she needs surgery

 She definitely needs surgery. 
 It's a minor outpatient procedure. 
 She's only    with no previous symptoms. 
 It's most likely benign. 
 We will need to do a needle 
 biopsy and a CT to confirm. 
 What's a needle biopsy? 
 It's kind of like a shot. 
 In my belly? 
 Honey, it's okay. You'll be fine.

 Hey. 
 I just closed a deal 
 with one of the biggest CROs

 They're going to consolidate 
 all their clinical trials 
 at St. Bonaventure. 
 That's awesome. 
 Unless you're telling me 
 because you plan 
 to close the clinic 
 to make room for the CRO. 
 I have the space, but what I don't have 
 is a smart, aggressive, 
 ambitious physician 
 to manage the partnership 
 and serve as PI. 
 You interested? 
 I-I'm flattered. 
 It'll be a ton of work 
 but a great opportunity 
 for St. Bon's and yourself. 
 I agree. 
 It's just a bit unexpected. 
 Can I think about it? 
 Of course. Take some time. 
 But not too much. 
 I'll need an answer by Friday. 
 [BABBLES] 
 There's almost no viable cardiac tissue. 
 And poor contractions 
 in what little there is. 
 There's still an area of tissue left 
 that could be viable after CABG. 
 We can't start surgery just hoping 
 there's enough tissue 
 to reshape the ventricle. 
 That's an inherent risk 
 to this approach. 
 If you have another idea? 
 A BiVAD with an unmatched donor heart. 
 Considered it and ruled it out. 
 He'd reject an unmatched donor 
 heart in less than a year. 
 Beats dying on the table 
 in less than    hours. 
 I appreciate your opinion. 
 Not a huge fan of the tone. 
 Sorry. 
 If we put Bob on longer term 
 anti-rejection meds, 
 that would buy several more 
 months for the unmatched heart. 
 During which time, he'd be 
 completely vulnerable to infection. 
 I know SVR is high risk, 
 but given Bob's condition, 
 I'm convinced it's the only 
 solution to keep him alive 
 long enough to find 
 a matching donor heart. 
 I plan to spend some time 
 rehearsing every surgical step. 
 I'd suggest you two do the same. 
 [SIGHS SOFTLY]

 It was one of those moments

 Old dudes love reading about presidents.

 they would've done it all better. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 What's wrong? 
 It's not a cyst. 
 It's an invasive hydatidiform mole. 
 [SHAUN] Interesting. 
 That type of tumor could only occur 
 from a mutated fertilized egg. 
 She has had sex. 
 She's only   , which means 
 even if she consented, 
 it's statutory r*pe. 
 There's a new problem. Actually two. 
 This type of tumor is caused 
 by a mutation in a fertilized egg, 
 which means the surgery 
 will be more difficult. 
 It also means your daughter 
 has had sexual intercourse. 
 Wait, but I'm on birth control, 
 and we use condoms. 
 - How could I be pregnant? 
 - [SHAUN] You're not pregnant. 
 The implanted egg mutated 
 into a tumor instead of a fetus. 
 And no birth control is    % effective. 
 But you can still remove it, right? 
 Yes. 
 Y-You don't seem surprised to 
 learn your daughter's had sex. 
 I'm not learning it. 
 She's been going steady 
 with Ryan for over a year. 
 He's in her grade. 
 He's sweet. 
 A   -year-old child 
 should not be having sex. 
 I'm not a child, 
 and me and Ryan love each other. 
 And if I want to have sex 
 with him, it's my decision. 
 You're okay with this? 
 Teenagers are gonna do it no 
 matter what their parents say. 
 So instead of forcing her 
 to sneak around, 
 I chose to talk to her about safe sex, 
 birth control, 
 and help her have a positive experience. 
 Your daughter... 
 Is scheduled 
 for surgery tomorrow morning. 
 And as I deflate the balloon... 
 I'll remove the final clamps. 
 That was... awesome. 
 Still not sure it's gonna work, 
 but it'll definitely be exciting. 
 I'd keep the pessimism 
 to yourself this time. 
 Okay, I'm not a pessimist... 
 I'm a realist. 
 [CHUCKLING] Who's on probation. 
 I know. Lim is a grown-up. 
 She wants her ideas to be challenged. 
 It's part of our job to do it. 
 In recovery, we talk a lot

 Hey, Lim is not a higher power. 
 And you're confusing being 
 humble with being a wuss. 
 [CELLPHONES CHIME] 
 Ah, it's Lim. 
 But feel free to ignore it. 
 Show her what a badass you are. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

 I took it off. 
 Lim's covering my residents, 
 and, uh, Kellan's in town. 
 - Mm. 
 - We're gonna see Young the Giant. 
 And left these in my desk. 
 That'll be fun. 
 Yeah, fun for me. 
 I think he'd rather be with his friends. 
 Although, he does enjoy me 
 paying for the tickets and beer. 
 Oh, my God, Kellan can drink now? 
 I'm sure he's been drinking for a while, 
 but, yeah, legally for a month now. 
 Time flies. 
 Faster than you'd ever imagine.

 exactly what I have been looking for, 
 but it's gonna mean 
 a lot more time at work, 
 and I'm hoping to be a mother soon. 
 My favorite memories 
 are all school plays, 
 baseball games, camping trips. 
 And my biggest regret is that I 
 missed way too many of those moments. 
 Sorry. 
 I wouldn't have asked if I 
 didn't want to hear your answer. 
 You have a great job.

 maybe not the opportunity of a lifetime, 
 but you can have a set 
 schedule with reasonable hours. 
 You know, it seems to me, you

 And tell Kellan I said hi. 
 Will do. 
 Kelli is prepped and ready 
 for tomorrow morning. 
 Good. We are going home. 
 A   -year-old can't consent to sex, 
 and we're obligated 
 to report it if she does. 
 You want to call the cops because 
 she had sex with her boyfriend? 
 Not the police. 
 Child Protective Services. 
 Just because her mom says it's okay 
 doesn't negate that it's statutory r*pe. 
 But if two   -year-olds have sex, 
 which one is the r*pist, 
 and which one is the r*pe victim? 
 They're 
 both 
 victims. 
 But only if they're both rapists, 
 which doesn't make sense. 
 The terminology is not the issue, Shaun. 
 She's in seventh grade, 
 sleeps with a teddy bear. 
 At the very least, her mother should 
 be required to talk to a counselor. 
 You really think that would help 
 or just create an even bigger mess? 
 That's not our call. 
 - We have a duty to... 
 - No, we don't. 
 Our patient is post-pubescent, 
 Tanner stage four. 
 She has the right to her own 
 decisions regarding sexual activity, 
 as long as the partner 
 is of similar age. 
 Just because her body has 
 matured doesn't mean she's... 
 I am the attending, 
 and that is my decision. 
 That's true, Shaun, 
 but maybe you two 
 should discuss it a bit more. 
 The law is clear. 
 There is nothing more to discuss. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Mmm. That smells amazing.

 Not to mention your fondness

 No such thing as extra clean. 
 No, but I cleaned it. 
 You rinsed it. 
 I'm gonna saute some vegetables. 
 Should be ready in    minutes. 
 Okay. I'll get changed. 
 There... the septal leaflet 
 of the tricuspid. 
 Play it again. 
 He's got severe regurg. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Which means we need to add 
 a valve repair to the CABG 
 and ventricular reconstruction. 
 There's no way he's strong 
 enough for that much surgery. 
 We don't have a choice. 
 I just need to figure out how 
 to do it all in one procedure. 
 We could still do the BiVAD 
 with unmatched donor. 
 No. It's... The same idea 
 I said no to before. 
 [SIGHS] 
 So, what do you want us to do? 
 Nothing. 
 I need to think this through on my own. 
 We could help you research. 
 I just need to figure out 
 the best surgical plan. 
 Have you considered 
 implanting an Impella first 
 to decrease the afterload? 
 And significantly increase 
 his odds of stroking out? 
 Sorry. Go home, get rest. 
 This is my problem. I'll figure it out.

 Repaired ventricle and replaced valve. 
 This is really my... only option? 
 There are mechanical heart devices. 
 That I've already considered. 
 With heart failure as advanced as yours, 
 it's not a better option. 
 [BOB BREATHING DEEPLY] 
 Okay. 
 Okay. 
 Whatever you think is best. 
 We're gonna take good care of you. 
 I know. Thank you. 
 Get the new valve prepped. 
 [GIGGLES] 
 Good morning. 
 Oh. When you start your morning 
 with shower sex and croissants, 
 it definitely is. 
 Lucky you. 
 Would you be okay if your son 
 was having shower sex and 
 croissants in middle school? 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I am still contemplating nursery colors, 
 so not ready to think about all that. 
 But... maybe her mom has a point. 
 I spent all of my high school 
 sneaking around my parents' backs. 
 That's not a relationship 
 I want with my kid. 
 We're talking about kids... early teens. 
 I was    when I lost my virginity. 
 Leon Maxwell. 
 We'd been together for a year. 
 I was sure I was ready. 
 And... how was it? 
 Fine. 
 Fun, after we figured some things out. 
 But starting from Leon, 
 all the way to Dwayne in med school, 
 sex has always felt like a distraction. 
 [LEA] A distraction? 
 Okay, definitely sounds like those guys 
 had no idea what they were doing. 
 Once I was intimate in a relationship, 
 I felt less like my true self 
 and less close to God. 
 That's why I stopped. 
 Stopped? 
 Like, stopped... 
 Having sex. 
 I don't intend to do it again 
 until I'm married. 
 How long has it been? 
 Years ago, before we met. 
 You never told me. 
 We joke about sex all the time. 
 I go along with the jokes 
 so I don't become the joke. 
 I would never make fun of you 
 for anything like that. 
 Lea, you told me my Bible study 
 group was ""Fantasy Faithball."" 
 Mm. 
 I'm sorry. 
 But then what was your plan with Perez? 
 The same as any guy I date. 
 It's not like I don't kiss or 
 some other things, but... 
 if a man is not willing to commit 
 to who I am as a person or what I 
 believe in, he is not worth my time. 
 It just... seems a bit extreme? 
 And a little sad. 
 I mean, it can be 
 a really fun part of life, 
 and you've just 
 cut yourself off from it. 
 You're not listening to me. 
 For me, it wasn't a value add... 
 it was the... 
 This is why I don't tell people. 
 It's impossible to know exactly 
 how to shape and size this valve 
 without knowing the shape 
 of the heart it's going into. 
 Which we won't know until Lim 
 finishes repairing the ventricle. 
 [SIGHS] 
 He'd be better off 
 with a transplant, right? 
 I agree. 
 The patient's just going along 
 'cause Lim steamrolled him. 
 A square peg won't seal a round hole, 
 and at the stage of the surgery 
 we're going to find that out, 
 it will be too late to turn back. 
 It is not a perfect solution, 
 but it's the best we have. 
 And you've explained to Bob 
 just how imperfect this solution is? 
 He's aware of the risks 
 and that he has limited options. 
 Sometimes patients need help 
 making difficult decisions. 
 I don't think this is a decision 
 you should be making for him. 
 And I'm not the only one. 
 I trust you. 
 We're operating on Bob 
 first thing in the morning. 
 [ALARM BLARING] 
 Her blood pressure skyrocketed. 
 She could have a stroke. 
 Start IV labetalol. 
 This is why children shouldn't have... 
 Stop. 
 You need to focus on the medicine. 
 She is going into critical bradycardia. 
 We need to push atropine. 
 My patient's blood pressure 
 has remained stable. 
 We can operate tomorrow. 
 That's great. 
 Mmm. This smells amazing. 
 Mmm. Tastes even better. 
 The secret is thyme. 
 You got to have fresh thyme, 
 because if you let it dry, 
 it saps all the flavor. 
 That and a little bit of lemon zest. 
 Truth b*mb... uh, I might have 
 oversold my enthusiasm 
 for you staying here, 
 but if you keep cooking 
 like Gordon Ramsay, 
 I won't let you leave. 
 Well, as much as I love sleeping in a 
 twin bed 
 in a half-remodeled nursery, 
 - I think I may have to decline. 
 - [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] 
 Yeah, Ruben? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 That's... That's double the quote. 
 Okay. Yeah. 
 Approved. 
 Unbelievable. 
 Now I have to replace the roof rafters. 
 Yay. 
 [LEA] If you have to 
 replace the whole roof, 
 why not just get a brand-new house? 
 Why would I do that? I love the house. 
 It's ancient, too big for one person, 
 and completely falling apart. 
 You do complain a lot about 
 all the repairs you have to do. 
 That is the house where we 
 brought Maddie home as a newborn. 
 That is the house where we celebrated 
 every single one of her birthdays. 
 Every year, we'd turn that 
 house into a haunted house 
 with a cemetery in the backyard 
 and a fog machine. 
 We scared the living daylights 
 out of every kid in the neighborhood. 
 I come home into that foyer... 
 and that staircase 
 is where Maddie would descend 
 in her prom dress. 
 You can never sell that house. 
 I can never sell that house. 
 Clinic's low on phlebotomy kits. 
 Any chance we could 
 steal some from surgical? 
 Sure. Just make us whole 
 when your shipment gets in. 
 - Andrews offered me... 
 - I heard. 
 - Congrats. You deserve it. 
 - Thanks. 
 I do. But... 
 you're smart, aggressive, and ambitious. 
 I'm sensing there's another ""but."" 
 You decided to never have kids. 
 Wouldn't really say I decided. 
 It just never happened. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - Don't be. 
 I can't be both the mother 
 I'd want to be 
 and the driven, 
 perfectionist surgeon I know I am. 
 My advice... decide what 
 brings you the most fulfillment 
 and then commit fully to that. 
 You can't have it all. 
 - But plenty of men... 
 - No, they don't. 
 They're just less conflicted 
 about the choices they make. 
 You totally put me on the spot with Lim. 
 I never said I was gonna back you up. 
 You're right. My bad. 
 You and I know probation 
 means different things for us. 
 Yours is a slap on the wrist, 
 a correction for coloring 
 outside the lines. 
 I'm in a holding pattern, 
 while everybody watches to see 
 if I'm actually a surgeon or a junkie. 
 Part of being a surgeon is standing up 
 and fighting for your patients. 
 [SHOWER RUNNING] 
 - [GASPS, SCREAMS] 
 - [SCREAMS] 
 Why'd you leave your robe 
 hanging on the bathroom door? 
 I didn't. I lent my extra one 
 to Dr. Glassman. 
 You both hang your robes 
 outside the bathroom? 
 I never noticed that before. 
 [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] 
 - [JORDAN LAUGHING] 
 - I'm glad you find it so amusing. 
 What'd you expect? 
 You ran a sneak attack on your 
 husband when you had a house guest. 
 Who else hangs their robe 
 outside the bathroom 
 so the steam doesn't make it moist? 
 - Mm. 
 - And that's not the only thing. 
 Their cooking techniques, 
 cleaning styles, 
 the way they lay out their toiletries. 
 You said he's like Shaun's father. 
 - Yeah. 
 - The apple doesn't fall far. 
 Somehow, in this case, 
 I think Shaun's actually the tree. 
 - Uhh... 
 - [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 One thing is clear. 
 Grandpa Glassman needs a new robe, 
 one that doesn't match your husband's. 
 Aww. Grandpa Glassy. 
 I love that. 
 Now if only I could erase a 
 certain image of Grandpa Glassy. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 Hey, I'm really sorry 
 about saying 
 you were... extreme and sad. 
 Thank you. 
 It's unfair of me to blame you 
 for being surprised at something 
 I've intentionally never shared. 
 Abstinence is important to me, 
 but I don't always feel 
 comfortable being open about it. 
 Well, I'm really glad you did. 
 Do you have a vibrator? 
 Because in terms of getting 
 closer to God, I find... 
 No, we're not talking 
 about this right now. 
 - Two croissants, please. 
 - Mm. 
 Cut this suture, Dr. Wolke. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 The valve is seated... nicely. 
 I've removed a lot of scar tissue from 
 this ventricle, but there's still more. 
 We need enough viable tissue 
 to close this ventricle. 
 I don't think we have it. 
 Hold this clamp. Tightly. 
 This area looked good in the 
 pre-op MIBI scan, but it's dead now. 
 Must be delayed apoptosis. 
 [DR. LIM] What's the plan? 
 I need an idea. Any idea. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [DR. LIM] We could do 
 an additional vessel bypass. 
 It might restore 
 some hibernating tissue. 
 Some, but we'd never find 
 enough to make up for this deficit. 
 Can we use a synthetic patch 
 to close the gap? 
 [ASHER] It needs muscle tissue 
 for the ventricle to pump. 
 You can't have a functional heart 
 without a working right ventricle. 
 [DR. LIM SIGHS] 
 Unless we do what we do in 
 babies with Ebstein's Anomaly. 
 Bypass the defective right ventricle, 
 divert deoxygenated blood 
 directly back to the lungs. 
 He'd only have one ventricle 
 pumping blood to his entire body. 
 But in time, 
 the left ventricle would get stronger. 
 We keep those babies alive 
 until they're teenagers. 
 That could buy you plenty of 
 time to find a matched donor heart. 
 Let's go. 
 Hey. 
 They already have four 
 clinical trials with IRB approval. 
 [CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 I am honored that you thought of me. 
 It's just... 
 I'm trying to get pregnant... 
 IVF with a donor. 
 And I've decided... 
 ...I can't have it all. 
 At the risk of... overstepping... 
 ...I think you're 
 selling yourself short. 
 My mother was the Senior 
 Director for Human Rights First. 
 Total workaholic. 
 Growing up, sometimes it seemed like 
 she was always on the phone or a plane. 
 Mm. 
 That must have been hard for you. 
 It wasn't easy, but whenever I really 
 needed her, 
 she was always there for me. 
 She was my idol. 
 And to this day, 
 if I need advice on a tough decision, 
 she's my first call. 
 There's more to being a great mom 
 than parent-teacher conferences. 
 [SHAUN] Is her pressure climbing? 
 [JORDAN] No.     over   , 
 holding steady. 
 [SHAUN] Curettage is complete. 
 The entire tumor's evacuated. 
 Massage the uterine fundus. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY, ALARM BLARING] 
 Pressure's dropping. Fast. 
 She is going into shock. 
 Could the tumor have caused 
 some sort of bleeding disorder? 
 There's no bleeding down here. 
 Push vasopressors and fluids. 
 [ALARM BLARING] 
 What is this? 
 The tumor thinned her uterine wall. 
 She's perforated. 
 She's bleeding internally. 
 Prep her for a STAT laparotomy. 
 [JORDAN] Rapid infuse 
 two units of O neg. 
 We need to isolate the vessel 
 and clamp it before she... 
 [MONITOR BEEPS, FLATLINES] 
 We just lost her pulse. 
 Retraction. 
 A uni-heart? That's new. 
 [DR. LIM] Well, once we removed 
 the scar tissue, 
 there was even less viable 
 muscle than what we anticipated. 
 Dr. Wolke came through with the audible. 
 Uh, sports reference. 
 She's saying it was your idea. 
 Aww. 
 Which Dr. Lim ex*cuted brilliantly. 
 And I'd be saying that even 
 if she weren't in the room. 
 You'll still need 
 a donor heart eventually, 
 but this should buy you five years, 
 maybe more before that. 
 Thank you. 
 The surgery was too dangerous for Bob. 
 You were right about that. 
 And about advocating for the patient, 
 even when you were pissing me off. 
 Might've helped if I had 
 had the uni-heart idea 
 before the patient 
 was splayed open on the table. 
 Yeah, sometimes great things 
 come out of pressure. 
 Although, I try not to depend on them. 
 Sounds like the perfect prelude 
 to letting me off probation. 
 [SIGHS] Don't push it. 
 But... excellent work. Keep it up. 
 You too, Dr. Perez. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Hi, honey. 
 Is it over? 
 Your surgery was a lot more 
 complicated than anticipated, 
 and it was successful. 
 We got all the tumor. 
 Everything kinda hurts. 
 I will increase your medication. 
 - Ryan. 
 - Hey. 
 I thought this little guy might, 
 uh, make you feel better. 
 Aww. He's such a cutie. 
 [RYAN] Yeah, I got him at the gift shop. 
 Hey, I brought your laptop, too. 
 The group chat's blowing up 
 over this new Apex update. 
 Um, is there Wi-Fi in this place? 
 Kelli needs to rest tonight. 
 [SHAUN] And when you go home, 
 sexual activity will be very risky, 
 given the trauma of your surgery. 
 - For how long? 
 - Six months, at least. 
 And maybe you should think 
 about waiting even longer. 
 We'll talk more about this later. 
 Thank you... 
 ...both... 
 ...for saving my girl. 
 [DIALING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 Hey. It's Danny. 
 Yeah. Having a bit of a rough week. 
 Thanks, man. [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 Uh, you know where 
 St. Bon's hospital is? 
 There's a coffee shop two blocks west. 
 I'll meet you out front in   . 
 Okay. 
 This is awkward. 
 What's awkward? Nothing happened. 
 Wait. What do you mean nothing... 
 What do you mean, what do I mean? 
 Nothing happened. 
 - Right. Nothing happened. 
 - Exactly. 
 That is very impressive. 
 If I saw your mom totally naked 
 and I was also totally naked, 
 I would definitely never forget... 
 - That's not helping, Shaun. 
 - Thank you, Shaun. 
 You know what? All things considered, 
 I actually had a really nice time. 
 I'll be craving that salmon. 
 I wrote down the recipe. 
 Actually, the salmon 
 comes out a lot more tender 
 - out of my Viking oven. 
 - [CELLPHONE VIBRATING] 
 I'm gonna have you both over 
 to dinner as a ""thank you."" 
 And my neighbor is calling. 
 The one who stole your lawn mower? 
 No, the one who cut back 
 my trees without asking. 
 Yes, Brent? 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. 
 What? 
 Danny. 
 I was surprised to hear from you, man. 
 - Heard you went to rehab. 
 - Yeah. 
 All good. Been four times myself. 
 I'm kinda in a hurry. 
 It's mostly black tar 
 around right now, but... 
 I got a little bit of white.

 Good morning. 
 Admissions percentages at top colleges 
 have dropped to record lows. 
 You thinking about going back to school? 
 No. No. 
 I'm thinking about our son's future. 
 As in starting a college fund 
 for the Peanut? 
 No, I have put the Peanut on a waitlist 
 for pre-kindergarten at McLelland Hall. 
 Isn't McLelland Hall that snobby 
 private school in Menlo Park? 
 It is one of the top 
 three feeder schools 
 for Stanford University. 
 So, you've not only decided 
 he's going to college, 
 you've also picked out which one. 
 Given our son's genetic makeup, 
 he will probably be very intelligent 
 and will require a challenging 
 academic curriculum. 
 Or he may not even enjoy academics. 
 Whatever he ends up doing 
 will be his call, not ours. 
 Whatever pre-kindergarten 
 he ends up attending 
 will be our call, not his. 
 Hmm. 
 Oh. No coffee. 
 Glassy still in his room? 
 No, I heard him leave at  :  . 
 He's been so sad about losing his house. 
 How can you tell he's sad? 
 Have you noticed how quiet he's been? 
 Yes. It's been nice. 
 Guess he's just throwing 
 himself into his work. 
 Hmm. 
 [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] 
 Dr. Murphy, little help here? 
 Hmm. 
 Give tetanus booster, clean the wound 
 - with Betadine, administer... 
 - No, we got that. It's... 
 We wanted a second opinion. 
 Uh, Victor did. 
 Before these young pups 
 take a saw to our son's foot, 
 I'd like to talk to a supervisor. 
 The nail's bent. 
 I am their supervisor, 
 and we need the saw 
 to cut the nail, not his foot. 
 Are you good, Ricky? 
 [SAW WHIRRING] 
 You all know my angel 
 for the past    years, 
 - Dr. Lim. 
 - Oh. 
 Hey, Roses. And this is my resident, 
 Dr. Jordan Allen. 
 Hi! Roses? 
 My website's called 
 ""More than    Roses."" 
 It's what I called it 
 when I was diagnosed at five. 
 Sixty-five roses, cystic fibrosis. 
 Okay. 
 And welcome to vlog number    , 
 going out all around the world. 
 And what does DLT stand for? 
 Oh, 
 that would be ""double lung transplant."" 
 [IMITATES AIR HORN] 
 [BOTH] Whoo! Whoo! 
 [CHUCKLES] Your new lungs just arrived. 
 Oh. 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I never should've agreed to let him go. 
 You didn't. You just stopped 
 fighting with me about it. 
 He's running a mild fever,    . . 
 Go where? 
 Church camping trip, 
 less than an hour away. 
 Camping can be very dangerous. 
 Thank you, Dr. Murphy. 
 You know, I had my first 
 fire-roasted s'more last summer, 
 so camping can also be very fun. 
 Thank you, Dr. Wolke. 
 Be careful, please. 
 Victor, he's a doctor. 
 Just try to trust... 
 Trust that things will work out, yep. 
 I know. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You're a Warriors fan, huh? 
 You like Steph Curry? 
 I like Draymond. 
 A rebel. I like it. 
 Huh. Look at this beast. 
 Nice job, Ricky. 
 [THERMOMETER BEEPS] 
 His temperature just jumped two degrees. 
 Let's get a CBC, blood cultures, 
 and a CT of his foot to check for 
 damage to the bones and muscles. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Dr. Park, how kind of you to join me. 
 You paged me. 
 Have a seat. And, yes, 
 they're Herman Miller. 
 Cappuccino, mochaccino, espresso, latte? 
 None of those are for you. 
 Okay, I was wrong. 
 This is the perfect job for you. 
 Your first study has, 
 what,     patients? 
 But since you've had 
 four whole days to hire 
 all the clinical trial nurses 
 you'll need, 
 should be easy. 
 I may be a little behind 
 and may already have 
 thirteen patients waiting, 
 but I will handle it. 
 With a lot of cappuccinos. 
 Thanks for your support. 
 Do you want me to give you a hand? 
 I have    minutes 
 before my next surgery. 
 In exchange for unlimited 
 use of your espresso machine. 
 We'll see. 
 [CT SCAN WHIRS] 
 Poor Ricky. 
 He probably just has a minor infection. 
 I meant the parents. 
 They went to two very different 
 schools of thought on child rearing. 
 It's hard on the marriage 
 but harder on the kid. 
 Everyone has 
 different opinions, Dr. Wolke. 
 Yeah, which they really need 
 to sort out before having kids. 
 My college roommate, who was Jewish, 
 married a wonderful Catholic woman. 
 They had three children 
 in quick succession, 
 started fighting about 
 how to parent them non-stop. 
 [DANIEL] See, my parents never 
 fought about us 
 because my dad didn't care, 
 as long as my mom got 
 me and my brother dressed 
 and out in time for chores. 
 Well... 
 No hematoma or abscess. 
 No explanation for the fever. 
 [RICKY GASPS] 
 My neck, it really hurts. 
 Okay. 
 [VOMITS] 
 Hey. I got you. 
 [VOMITING CONTINUES] 
 He has tick bites on his back. 
 Pink, plump, and spongy. 
 What's that? 
 Pneumonia? 
 In both lungs. 
 [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] 
 She's lucky if she has another week. 
 Ex vivo lung perfusion. 
 Maybe we can make 
 the lungs heal themselves. 
 That's usually used in cases 
 involving pulmonary edema. 
 Get the lungs. Meet me 
 in the Procedure Room. 
 Tick bites? 
 His fever, vomiting, and sore neck... 
 - which could be neurological... 
 - It's in his brain? 
 Possibly, but the blood tests 
 were inconclusive, 
 so we'd like to do a lumbar puncture 
 to check Ricky's cerebrospinal fluid. 
 This camp just keeps 
 getting better and better. 
 Can we not do this right now? 
 I just want to make sure 
 this never happens again. 
 And I don't? 
 I care about our son 
 every bit as much as you do. 
 And yet, you keep prioritizing 
 fun over safety. 
 Yes, I care about fun, 
 and socialization, 
 self-esteem, self-expression... 
 Yeah, none of which are 
 as important as his safety. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I can't do this anymore. 
 [SIGHS] Wh... 
 [SIGHS] 
 Got through six so far. 
 Only one with a minor reaction. 
 - You? 
 - Me, too. 
 So, we are    down, one to go. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Mr. Riggs? 
 Mr. Riggs? 
 [EXHALES] Sorry. 
 I just drifted off. 
 [CHUCKLES] My fault for 
 keeping you waiting so long. 
 So, how are you feeling? 
 Aside from tired. 
 Uh, just a bit achy. 
 Especially my knees and elbows, hips. 
 And some mild jaundice. 
 Other than that, I feel pretty good. 
 [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] 
 - Hello. 
 - Oh. 
 We should sort out our 
 differences about child raising. 
 If this is about McLelland Hall, Shaun, 
 - it's not a big deal. 
 - Oh, no, I have made a list 
 of    other potential differences. 
 And I'd love to discuss them all, 
 but Andrews just approved 
 new EMR software 
 and wants me to run a beta test 
 on it in the next    hours. 
 - Have you talked to Glassy? 
 - No. 
 He didn't come to work today, 
 but I got a text. 
 He says that he is okay. 
 So where is he? 
 [DR. LIM] It is not over yet. 
 Lungs are remarkably resilient organs 
 when they are in a body. 
 Which is why we have to 
 convince them they still are. 
 We give them a blood supply 
 by hooking them up 
 to a perfusion machine, 
 an air supply by hooking 
 them up to a ventilator, 
 IV drips to feed them antibiotics, 
 and we might just be able 
 to con them back into viability. 
 The next six hours are crucial. 
 How will you know if they're viable? 
 Our main indicator is a 
 calculation called the P/F ratio. 
 When that reaches at least 
 millimeters of mercury, 
 those lungs are good to go. 
 Mom, relax, it's Dr. L. 
 [BEEPING] 
 Palpate to find the L -  interspace. 
 Maybe Lea and I will not be 
 able to sort out our differences 
 about child raising and become 
 angry like Victor and Shelley. 
 You and Lea are nothing like 
 Victor and Shelley. 
 They come from completely 
 different worlds, 
 have vastly different outlooks... 
 Lea and I are very different, too. 
 Insert the spinal needle. 
 [ASHER] And who knows 
 how much they love each other. 
 You and Lea, on the other hand, 
 I know you do. A lot. 
 And that's all that matters. 
 At least, according to 
 the Hallmark Channel. 
 I'm in. 
 Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
 The infection has elevated 
 his intracranial pressure. 
 Intubate and load him with 
 levetiracetam and dexamethasone 
 before his brain herniates. 
 CSF confirmed a very rare infection 
 called Naegleria fowleri. 
 It's a brain-eating amoeba that's 
 caused serious cerebral swelling. 
 We need to put Ricky 
 in a barbiturate-induced coma 
 and surgically place a port 
 into the center of his brain. 
 Then we will flood it with antibiotics, 
 which will hopefully reduce the edema. 
 And he contracted this from a tick? 
 Oh, no, it's contracted via 
 contaminated water through the nose. 
 So... So he got it from 
 the swimming hole at camp? 
 That's a good guess. 
 But Ricky's way too anxious around water 
 to ever put his head under, 
 let alone get water up his nose. 
 Naegleria Fowleri has also been found 
 in untreated swimming pools, 
 - nasal rinses, water heaters... 
 - Nasal rinses? 
 If unboiled tap water is used. 
 I gave him a nasal rinse 
 the morning he left for camp. 
 He had a runny nose. 
 That is a better guess. 
 Excuse me. 
 Riggs has fatigue, joint pain, 
 impaired mental acuity, 
 tachycardia, and mild liver failure. 
 - Thanks. 
 - Maybe he has a pre-existing condition. 
 In which case he should've 
 been eliminated 
 by any remotely competent 
 screening process. 
 Those protocols were in place 
 before you came on board. 
 I'll remind the CRO of that 
 when I tell them, on my first day... 
 that their $  million trial 
 needs to be trashed. 
 How about you save 
 the doomsday predictions 
 until after the blood panel results? 
 Lab is on the way to the OR. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 It hasn't been six hours yet, has it? 
 Six and a quarter. 
 [BEEPING] 
 [MONITOR CHIRPS] 
 You want company? 
 Thanks. 
 Hello. Where is Victor? 
 Beating himself up somewhere. 
 I just wish that made a difference. 
 Do you love each other? 
 Yeah. Of course. 
 We've always been oil and water. 
 That's how my dad describes us. 
 Victor grew up in Belgrade, 
 I grew up in Berkeley. 
 Different religions, politics, 
 socio-economic status. 
 But when I got pregnant, 
 we knew we had 
 a lot of issues to work out. 
 And we did. 
 And then Ricky was born, and... 
 we suddenly started arguing over... 
 when can he safely eat tree nuts? 
 How high should he climb 
 on the jungle gym? 
 When can he stay with a babysitter? 
 Those little things were the ones 
 we could never work out. 
 But, yes, we still love each other. 
 It's just that... 
 I'm not sure love is enough anymore. 
 [BRECKA] Still waiting, still hoping. 
 That's kinda what we do, 
 isn't it, Roses? 
 And the wait is over. 
 I'm sorry. 
 We've put you back on the list. 
 You're at the very top. 
 I deserved this. 
 I wanted those lungs. 
 [SIGHS] I wanted someone to die. 
 Brecka. 
 Honey, should we... Should we finish? 
 No. 
 [RAKE CLANKS] 
 - [SHAUN] Hello, Dr. Glassman. 
 - Geez! Man! 
 Shaun, you might try knocking next time, 
 although, you know, 
 that might be a little tough. 
 What are you looking for? 
 Oh, you know... 
 my life. 
 Just my life. 
 [OBJECT THUDS] 
 Not yet. 
 I think I'm gonna keep at it for a bit. 
 Okay. 
 No. This is on me. You can head home. 
 Thanks. 
 I will miss your big-screen LED TV. 
 It was old. 
 It had a pixel line down the right side. 
 Did you love Ilana? 
 What? Did I love Ilana? 
 Yeah, of course. 
 Did you love Debbie? 
 Yeah, I loved Debbie. 
 Where is this going, Shaun? 
 That wasn't enough for you 
 to get over your differences. 
 How do I know if love will be enough 
 for me and Lea to get over 
 our differences? 
 Well, you won't know. 
 I mean, how can you know? 
 You can't know. 
 I do not like worrying about this. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Well, look, I mean, 
 Lea had some doubts 
 a little while ago, right? 
 And you both got over that. 
 Yes, because I was very supportive. 
 Okay, well, there you go. 
 But differences about 
 child raising seem to be bigger 
 - than normal differences. 
 - Well, yeah. 
 I mean, having a child, 
 I mean, that's big. 
 That's huge. That's a shift. 
 It shifts everything, 
 marriage, everything. 
 I do not want a shift in our marriage. 
 Well, maybe it'll shift for the better. 
 Aardy's eye. 
 The first thing I ever bought 
 Maddie was a stuffed aardvark. 
 Back in the day, 
 I performed a   -hour surgery. 
 I removed an astrocytoma 
 from the medulla of the brainstem. 
 It was heroic. It put me on the map. 
 My elective surgeries 
 were booked out for a year. 
 I was in a zone, 
 like playing scratch golf. 
 And then Ilana got pregnant. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 She didn't want to stop working. 
 She had a real-estate thing. 
 She was doing very well. 
 I didn't want to stop working. 
 I wanted to stay on the map. 
 And then we brought Maddie home. 
 That first night... 
 everything changed. 
 Hmm. 
 Go talk to Lea. 
 I tried. 
 She had to run a beta test 
 on new EMR software. 
 Well, then, you'll have to wait 
 until she's done.

 [DOOR OPENS] 
 All I had on my DVR 
 was a marathon of Shark t*nk. 
 Can't say I was in the mood 
 to be staring 
 at Mr. Wonderful's bald head, 
 so why not entertain myself 
 by watching some 
 hot lung perfusion action? 
 I'm not one to kink shame. 
 Coffee and cronuts from Chaz's Bakery. 
 I'm happy for the company. 
 Noomie's not much 
 of a conversationalist. 
 N-Noomie?-My pet name for them. 
 From the Greek word 
 for lungs, pneumonas. 
 I thought it was better than Lung-ie. 
 Yeah, I may be losing it. 
 - Cronut. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - Mmm. 
 - Any progress? 
 Negligible. 
 I keep doing the same thing 
 over and over, 
 hoping for a different outcome. 
 Yeah, I'm definitely losing it. 
 Then do something different. 
 Okay. 
 Doubling up on antibiotics, 
 and we can add steroids. 
 This will either 
 hammer out the infection... 
 or the lungs. 
 [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
 How's Glassy? 
 Very sore and very sooty. 
 - Mmm. 
 - [DOOR CLOSES] 
 We need to talk. 
 About our    differences? 
 I thought of two more. 
 Shaun, as you know, 
 I'm kinda busy right now, 
 so you'll have to settle 
 for me agreeing that, 
 yes, we'll have many, many differences, 
 but in time, we'll be able 
 to work them out and... 
 That's what Victor and Shelley thought, 
 and now they are talking 
 about separating. 
 I don't know who Victor and Shelley are. 
 But in any event, I have at least 
 two more hours of work to do tonight. 
 [KEYBOARD CLACKING] 
 Okay. 
 - You're waiting, aren't you? 
 - Yes. 
 I am very patient. 
 You are very patient 
 and very understanding. 
 And you were so good with me 
 on our babymoon. 
 If you could just channel 
 some of that... 
 On our babymoon, 
 I thought love was enough. 
 That's... 
 kind of a big thing to drop on me 
 this late at night. 
 You were too busy to discuss it 
 in the morning, 
 so I talked to Dr. Glassman about it, 
 and he said having a child 
 will shift our dynamics. 
 And if it does, 
 we can talk about it then. 
 So if we can't talk 
 about our dynamics now, 
 how about our differences? 
 Apparently we have    of them, 
 so we're gonna need 
 a serious chunk of time, 
 and I'm pretty sure they'll keep, 
 because we're kinda committed 
 to having a kid together, 
 whether love is enough or not. 
 Shaun, I'm just... 
 I'm way too tired to have 
 a productive conversation 
 about this right now, okay? 
 Okay.

 [MONITOR CHIRPS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 It's time to call it. 
 I had a half an hour left on my call 
 when she first came to the ER, 
 coughing blood, vitals on the floor. 
 When we opened her up, 
 her lungs looked like 
 they belonged to a   -year-old. 
 Didn't think she'd make it 
 through the night. 
 She was eight. 
 [SIGHS] I couldn't go home. 
 I stayed with her that night. 
 And then, the next morning, she just... 
 opened her eyes, looked at me, 
 and told me she liked my French braid. 
 Once I call it... 
 I have to go up there 
 and tell her I failed her. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Got Riggs' latest test results. 
 Turns out he did have 
 a pre-existing condition... 
 hemochromatosis. 
 So the jerk lied about it 
 to get into the study. 
 That's your assumption? 
 He got $ ,    to participate. 
 I think it's a pretty sound assumption. 
 But whether he lied or not, 
 it means the screeners are incompetent. 
 That's gotta take a toll. 
 Expecting the worst of everybody. 
 I'd rather be pleasantly surprised 
 than bitterly disappointed. 
 And that's the worldview you 
 want to impart to your future child, 
 ""Assume the worst of everyone""? 
 - [ALARM BEEPING] 
 - Help! 
 We need help in here! 
 What's happening? 
 Add a milligram of lorazepam. 
 He's seizing. 
 [ASHER] Because his ICPs are in the   s. 
 Cerebral edema's gotten worse. 
 If we don't open up 
 Ricky's skull immediately,

 Removing large hemicrani skull flap. 
 Performing wide dural opening. 
 [DANIEL] Look at the monitor. 
 EEG's all over the place. 
 He's still seizing. 
 [SHAUN] Place an additional EVD 
 and increase propofol to burst suppress. 
 [ASHER] Eh, but he's maxed out. 
 If we give him any more 
 propofol, we could k*ll him. 
 If we don't, the seizures 
 will definitely k*ll him. 
 [MONITOR WARBLING] 
 [SHAUN] Oh. We can remove 
 the damaged cortex 
 in the left anterior temporal lobe 
 using ECoG and pre-op imaging 
 to guide us. 
 [DANIEL] Cut out part of his brain? 
 That's a little extreme. 
 [ASHER] It is the area 
 that's causing the seizures. 
 [ASHER] It'll just be a 
 tough sell to his parents. 
 [SHAUN] Which is why you will help. 
 Okay, please keep him stabilized 
 with iced LR to the cortical surface.

 [ASHER] We would cut out 
 a small piece of his cortex. 
 It's already been damaged 
 by the infection. 
 Removing it may be the only way 
 to keep him alive. 
 But how would that affect him? 
 There are areas of the brain 
 that are significantly 
 less essential than others. 
 This part only impacts 
 his speech and memory, 
 probably not long-term. 
 So he might not be able 
 to talk or know who we are? 
 We wouldn't be able to fully 
 assess him until he wakes up. 
 Ricky's skull is open. 
 We should do it. 
 Uh, th-this is a very good hospital, 
 these are very smart doctors. 
 And someone very wise

 ""Sometimes you just have to

 Okay. 
 Hmm. 
 [RIGGS] Hemochromatosis? 
 You never noticed 
 the symptoms until now? 
 Joint pain, fatigue, mental fuzziness? 
 Well, I turn    next week. 
 I mean, I haven't felt 
 a day over    until now. 
 It is very unlikely your hemochromatosis 
 went from   to    in a week. 
 Is it possible you gave the 
 screeners someone else's blood? 
 You think I cheated? For the money? 
 No, Mr. Riggs, I'm just trying to... 
 You're a blood donor 
 in the   -gallon club? 
 Yeah, regular donor, last    years. 
 When was the last time you donated? 
 Two months ago, just before 
 I started this trial. 
 And you're not allowed to 
 donate while you're in the trial. 
 Well, see, that's the downside. 
 I actually enjoy those cookies. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I'll make sure you get all the 
 cookies you want, Mr. Riggs. 
 [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] 
 Don't you think it's time to come home? 
 No. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Well, in that case... 
 I wanted to make you something delicious

 but I'm not a very good cook, 
 and everything's closed. 
 So, I hope you like 
 hot-dog-flavored potato chips 
 and Nutty Buddies. 
 Mmm. 
 Yeah. 
 Nail polish? 
 Father-daughter time. 
 Maddie insisted that 
 she paint my fingernails 
 a sparkly rainbow color. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 The next day, my first patient 
 was very uncomfortable. 
 That's when I realized I 
 forgot to remove the nail polish. 
 That's a nice memory. 
 Oh, sit. No, sit, sit, sit. 
 [SIGHS] So many memories. 
 The Halloween 
 Maddie wanted to go as a ham 
 because we'd just seen 
 To k*ll a Mockingbird. 
 But she wanted the ham to 
 be made out of an actual ham. 
 And then, one night, 
 the wind was blowing so hard, 
 it blew her bedroom door shut. 
 She was convinced that 
 her grandmother's ghost 
 had come back to visit her. 
 Wanted to sleep in our bed 
 for the next two weeks. 
 You didn't come here just to 
 feed me junk food, did you? 
 I thought you might need

 take me to author readings 
 by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou. 
 And you were there every day! 
 I probably served you some cookies. 
 You ever meet James Baldwin? 
 - I did. 
 - What? 
 [JORDAN] Okay. 
 She can probably use some rest. 
 Yes. Absolutely. 
 If you need anything at all, 
 Miss Evelyn, 
 you know where to find me. 
 - Thank you, Marcus. 
 - Yes, ma'am. 
 Marcus Books. Wow! 
 That was weird. 
 Not as weird as you refusing 
 to do his mentorship program. 
 [SIGHS SOFTLY] 
 Let's talk about you... 
 and your heart. 
 Your pericardium has become hardened, 
 likely from your cancer treatments. 
 So what happens now? 
 Dr. Lim has decided on 
 a partial removal. 
 And... And you think that's best? 
 Jordan Jacqueline Allen, 
 you look at me and you tell me 
 if you think it's best. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Wow. It took you guys a while 
 to get home, huh? 
 We went out to dinner 
 because Lea thought that... 
 Why are you on the floor? 
 What's with the high chairs? 
 I stopped at Costco on the way home. 
 Surprisingly diverse selection of wines. 
 There's an open bottle 
 if you... if you guys want, 
 although that might be empty. 
 Danger. 
 Oh, I remember wine. 
 Are you drunk? 
 No. Maybe a little. 
 I'm baby-proofing. 
 Danger. 
 Are you okay? 
 Oh, you guys gotta get 
 down here and check this out. 
 From the baby's perspective, 
 this place is a frickin' death trap... 
 for Nicholas. 
 Placeholder name. 
 We can call him Nick or Nicky. 
 I like Nicky. 
 Okay, why did you buy three highchairs? 
 Well, one's a gift for you, 
 and the other two I'll take back. 
 Danger. 
 That could be dangerous. 
 Y-You don't have to buy us anything. 
 I also got you a nanny cam. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 It's a... it's... it's a teddy bear, 
 but you wouldn't believe it, 
 there's a camera inside. 
 That is very practical. And cute. 
 Ugh, okay. We will not need a 
 highchair or baby-proofing for a year. 
 And we will not name our son 
 Nick, Nicholas, or Nicky, 
 or any variation thereof. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, well, that's fair enough. 
 But you... you're gonna want this. 
 It's a book by Dr. Spock on parenting. 
 Everyone read this book back in the day. 
 He was so popular, he ran for president. 
 Danger. 
 I'm going to bed. 
 Yeah, but you're gonna want 
 to r-read this 
 before the baby comes 
 and you get exhausted. 
 [LEA, MUFFLED] Already there. 
 Danger! 
 What were you thinking? 
 That my grandmother deserved 
 the good muffin? 
 She told me she will only agree 
 to complete decortication, 
 which she shouldn't even know about. 
 You do not present a patient 
 with an option 
 that I have deemed unsafe 
 and wouldn't even perform. 
 - It's unacceptable. 
 - You're right. 
 I felt like your plan was 
 a little conservative, but I... 
 You are a resident. 
 Your feelings about my 
 decisions are not relevant. 
 I'll let her know I was wrong. 
 And convince her I'm right. 
 Or find her another hospital. 
 Yes, ma'am. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Um, your muffins are ready. 
 How's he handling the chemo? 
 You doing okay, bud? 
 Nathan, can you answer Dr. Park, please? 
 Is everything okay? 
 No. 
 You're right. It's not okay. 
 Okay, these aren't toys. 
 We okay, Mom? 
 He got dozens of new toys 
 for his birthday. 
 He shouldn't have to be 
 building castles with pill bottles. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Maybe you shouldn't be 
 trying to do all of this alone. 
 My husband's saving lives. 
 I can't pull him away from that. 
 I can. 
 Give me your phone. 
 Hi, Rick. 
 Dr. Park. 
 Mm. 
 [JORDAN] You okay? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. 
 But you're not. 
 What happened? 
 I was wrong to question 
 Dr. Lim's surgical advice. 
 She's the best. 
 I hope to be her someday. 
 And if she thinks the partial 
 removal of the pericardium 
 is the best course of action, 
 then I agree with her. 
 Okay. 
 Then that's what I'll do. 
 But why did you go against 
 her advice in the first place? 
 I felt like I needed 
 to do extra, to be a hero. 
 Why? 
 Since I was little, you told me 
 I had to work twice as hard, 
 be twice as good as everybody else. 
 After all these years, I'm... 
 still striving 
 to be good enough for you. 
 Yeah, see, that's a lot of pressure. 
 But it's what the world requires 
 from people that look like you and me. 
 When's my daddy coming? 
 Your daddy's getting on a plane. 
 He's gonna be back soon. 
 But now, we have to see if 
 the medicine's working, okay? 
 If it is, can I stop taking it? 
 I'm so sorry. 
 You still need it. 
 I hate it. 
 I know. 
 Let's play a game, 
 like hide-and-seek, okay? 
 Okay, lie down. 
 You get to go in the tunnel. 
 And stay very still 
 so nobody can find you. 
 I'll come back and get you when 
 the coast is clear. 
 Sound good? 
 [MRI MACHINE WHIRRING] 
 You are very good with him. 
 Starting the imaging. 
 [DR. PARK] Thanks. 
 Nathan, you're about to hear 
 some banging. 
 It's just the machine. 
 But remember to stay really still, okay? 
 I am. 
 Try a little harder, okay, bud? 
 [MRI MACHINE CLACKING] 
 Ah, motion artifact. 
 We might have to sedate him. 
 Those are not artifacts. 
 He does not have CNS vasculitis. 
 He has moyamoya disease. 
 What the heck is that? 
 A narrow carotid artery is 
 reducing blood flow to his brain. 
 This area here, 
 looks like a puff of smoke? 
 That's what moyamoya means in Japanese. 
 A bunch of new, tiny vessels have 
 developed 
 to circumvent the blockage. 
 But because the vessels are abnormal, 
 they're prone to bleeds. 
 We can fix the problem with a 
 very interesting brain surgery. 
 Well, so... so now that you're done 
 poisoning our son with chemo 
 that he didn't need, 
 we should trust you 
 to crack open his skull? 
 We will use a small craniotomy 
 to access... 
 I get why you're frustrated. 
 Moyamoya is rare and 
 notoriously hard to diagnose. 
 Many kids get chemo they 
 don't need for a lot longer. 
 We're hoping to do Nathan's 
 first brain surgery tomorrow. 
 He needs more than one? 
 What's brain surgery? 
 Hey. 
 [DR. PARK] It's how we're gonna 
 make you all better. 
 No more chemo? 
 No more chemo. 
 Are you gonna be here? 
 My plane got cancelled, 
 buddy. [CHUCKLES] 
 But, uh... but, look, I-I promise 
 I'm gonna be there 
 as soon as I can, okay? 
 Can Patches get brain surgery, too? 
 N-No. 
 Patches is a stuffed animal. 
 It does not have a brain. 
 Oh. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [TOILET CLACKING] 
 Ohh! 
 [GRUNTS] Oh! 
 I just peed in our bathtub. 
 Glassman has to go. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 [PEREZ] Aah! 
 - Sorry! 
 - Hey! 
 Sorry! 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [GRUNTS] 
 First years. 
 [PANTING] 
 You are late again. 
 Come on. Like one minute. 
 And last time... 
 Your drug test from yesterday 
 was negative. 
 You are not using. 
 So what is causing your tardiness? 
 Look, I'm sorry. 
 I've been doing really well. 
 And the reason I'm doing so well... 
 is my daily meeting. 
 Sets my mind right. 
 It's kinda far, 
 and there's morning traffic. 
 Support is very important. 
 And so is punctuality. 
 I'm going to map a complex 
 double-barrel vascular bypass. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SAW WHIRRING] 
 - [POPS] 
 - Mnh! Dang it! 
 That's the sixth time 
 you've k*lled my grandmother. 
 It wasn't working with the rongeur. 
 I'm trying to sell Lim 
 on a little more power. 
 I just need to find the right torque. 
 That's reassuring. 
 Stop hovering. Go visit, visitor. 
 Convincing Evelyn Allen to do a surgery, 
 after convincing her not to, 
 was a little bumpy. 
 Details, please. 
 I took the opportunity to 
 explain how much pressure 
 she's put on me over the years, 
 and she took that opportunity 
 to make me feel inadequate once again. 
 I never thought of you as 
 someone who lacks for confidence. 
 Fake it 'til you make it. 
 You're a resident in one 
 of the top surgical programs. 
 You've already made it. 
 All I see is the ground 
 I've still got to cover. 
 [SAW WHIRRING] 
 - [POPS] 
 - Mnh! 
 How's it going? 
 Not ready for prime time. 
 This STA anatomy is ideal as a 
 donor vessel to bypass the blockage. 
 So, we'll reroute the scalp 
 vessel into the brain here. 
 Gonna give you a little tip. 
 Next time a child asks 
 if you could do surgery 
 on his stuffed animal 
 so that he feels less scared? 
 Say yes. 
 I was only telling him the truth. 
 Oh. 
 This branch of 
 the middle cerebral artery 
 looks like an ideal recipient. 
 You're about to be a father. 
 Children are illogical. 
 And we can place temporary 
 clips for vascular control, 
 and then anastomose the STA 
 to the MCA using   -  Prolenes. 
 [BEEPS] 
 I was very logical as a child. 
 I did not like being talked to 
 like I was dumb, 
 and I definitely did not like 
 being lied to. 
 That child there felt that 
 if his Dalmatian 
 went through this scary thing with him, 
 he'd be less scared. 
 If can embrace another person's 
 thought process, 
 it can strengthen the relationship. 
 Lea thinks she should not 
 have to pee in the tub... 
 which I understand. 
 No kidnapping my grandmother. 
 I asked him to do a lap 
 around the floor. 
 I needed a change of scenery. 
 Well, you've had your lap, 
 now back to your cell. 
 Thanks for the tour, Speedy. 
 Speedy? 
 I'm guessing it's because I was 
 sprinting through here this morning. 
 Yeah, I was late. 
 Second time this week. 
 Snooze buttons... the devil's plaything. 
 I was actually at a Narcotics 
 Anonymous meeting this morning. 
 I go every day. 
 ""Confess your sins to each other 
 and pray for each other 
 so you may be healed."" 
 James  :  . 
 Amen to that. 
 Good for you, young man. 
 There's gotta be a closer meeting. 
 I've tried the closer one. 
 The hard-liners who run it think that 
 wearing a suit and tie 
 is the key to staying sober. 
 Start your own meeting, 
 here at the hospital. 
 Set your own tone. 
 And you're never late for work again. 
 [CHUCKLES] I'm not... 
 I'm not qualified to be a leader. 
 No such thing. 
 Leaders lead. 
 Simple as that. 
 Hm. 
 You are annoying. 
 Well, nice to see you, too, Shaun. 
 Not to me, but to Lea. 
 And I want to keep 
 our relationship strong. 
 She feels your presence 
 has taken over our apartment, 
 and she wants her space back. 
 I overstepped with the baby-proofing? 
 And suggesting names. 
 And the Dr. Spock thing? 
 And there's more. The nanny cam... 
 Okay, okay, okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It was fun thinking about your baby 
 and the future, and... 
 Maybe it has been a nice distraction. 
 Yes, it was. 
 Which you've needed 
 since your house burned down 
 and you lost all of your belongings 
 and you have no place to live. 
 Yes. Thank you, Shaun. 
 Dr. Glassman, 
 you are not exactly my family. 
 I get it. I-I know, Shaun. 
 But I consider you to be 
 the baby's grandfather. 
 Wow. 
 Thank you. 
 I never thought that 
 would happen for me. 
 Thank you. 
 You can stay. 
 I will tell Lea, 
 and she will change her mind. 
 No, no, no. I'm going to go. 
 [SHAUN] Where? 
 I don't know. 
 Can I get you a magazine? 
 No, thank you. 
 Are your pillows positioned okay? 
 [SIGHS] Okay, you're doing it again. 
 What? 
 That thing you've been doing 
 since you were little 
 where you're just fussing over people, 
 when it's you that's in need. 
 Okay, come on. 
 Tell me. 
 You just met Dr. Perez, 
 and you were so nice and supportive. 
 Do you know how long 
 I've waited for you to say, 
 ""Good job"" to me, 
 or, ""Wow, you're a doctor""? 
 [SIGHS] 
 Do you know who Rebecca Crumpler is? 
 No. 
 She was the first Black female doctor. 
 And when I read about her, 
 I wanted to be just like her. 
 But, unfortunately, I didn't 
 know who she was, either... 
 until you were in med school. 
 Quinque, I have been impressed by you 
 since you were in kindergarten. 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
 - Grandma? 
 - [ALARMS BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 Grandma? 
 What's going on? 
 She's having trouble breathing. 
 [GASPING] 
 She's hypotensive. 
 [PANTING] 
 Jugular vein distention has increased. 
 Her heart is failing. 
 Tell me you got through a practice run. 
 I was coming to say we 
 were postponing the surgery 
 so we could practice more. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] What are you hanging? 
 Uh, it's... 
 You can read, obviously. 
 Is this okay? I'm sorry. 
 I should've cleared it with you first. 
 Yes, you should have. 
 Because I would've told you to use 
 the small conference room up on  . 
 It's quieter up there, 
 and the room has blinds... 
 to help with the ""anonymous"" part. 
 Thanks. 
 [CELLPHONE RINGING] 
 This is Park. 
 I had to fly to San Francisco. 
 I'm just grabbing a cab now. 
 Can you... Can you hold 
 the surgery until I get there? 
 We can't. 
 If he hemorrhages again... 
 Well, can... can... Can you 
 put him on the phone? 
 He's already sedated. 
 But what if... what if 
 this was my last chance 
 to talk to him? 
 I'll treat Nathan 
 like my own son, I promise. 
 Thank you. 
 - [SAW WHIRRING] 
 - Try to puncture the pericardium 
 and grab an edge so we can 
 start to peel the shell. 
 Mm! 
 Apply more pressure. 
 [SAW WHIRRING] 
 We might need to use another tool 
 to pierce it. 
 Let's try the rongeur. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 - Ah! 
 - Perforation of the myocardium. 
 - Manually tamponading the hole. 
 - [ALARMS BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 Pledgeted sutures. 
 The pericardium's just too calcified. 
 It's adherent to the myocardium. 
 So what do we do? 
 Repair the perforation. 
 After that, I'm open to ideas. 
 We could put her on bypass. 
 Gently peel off the calcified 
 pericardium bit by bit. 
 And then repair the damage as we go? 
 That's like poking holes in a bucket 
 and then hoping we can plug 
 them before all the water leaks out. 
 [JORDAN] I have an idea. 
 Go ahead. 
 It's called the waffle procedure. 
 I found a novel study that said 
 dense calcified plaques 
 can be scored into multiple 
 cross-hatched sections. 
 No removal at all? 
 Exactly. The shell stays in its place, 
 but the heart has room to 
 expand and contract as it beats. 
 Mortality rate? 
 Under  %. 
 Talk me through it. 
 Okay. Ultrasonic scalpel. 
 Start by incising 
 the calcified pericardium. 
 [SAW WHIRRING] 
 ICG angio looks great. 
 Dr. Perez, you may do the dural closure, 
 then replace the skull flap. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Before we close... 
 We're almost a full hour 
 ahead of schedule. 
 Why not go ahead with the 
 bypass in his other hemisphere? 
 Mm, that is not the plan. 
 Simultaneous bilateral surgery 
 risks altering brain flow too much. 
 It could cause another bleed. 
 But maybe there's a way 
 to reduce that risk. 
 The wait for the follow-up 
 surgery will be hell on the parents, 
 the whole time knowing 
 their son's brain... 
 The parents' stress 
 is not medically relevant. 
 I know, Shaun, but, please... 
 Can you think of any other way? 
 An encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis 
 of the left side 
 would be relatively low risk. 
 We could safely do that now. 
 Thank you. 
 Rick, Linda. 
 The surgery went well. 
 [GROANS] 
 [IN SING-SONG] There she is. 
 [NORMAL VOICE] Right on schedule. 
 How do you feel? 
 Like I can breathe, 
 for the first time in a long time. 
 Thank Dr. Lim for me. 
 I will. 
 Somebody's all puffed up. 
 Uh... 
 You did something. 
 The surgical team got a little stuck. 
 I just gave them a new idea. 
 [CHUCKLES] Good job. 
 Wow! You're a doctor. 
 Wow. Okay. 
 You're just laying it on 
 a little too thick now. 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 [DR. PARK] Looking good. 
 How are you feeling? 
 Okay. 
 Can you give me a high five? 
 High ten? 
 - Hey, good job! 
 - Good job, buddy! 
 Good boy, buddy. 
 Where's Patches? 
 He is right here. 
 You did do the brain surgery on him. 
 No, I just put bandages on its 
 head to make you feel better. 
 I do. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [EXHALES] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Uh, I'm sorry. There's a meeting. 
 I know. NA, right? 
 Uh, yeah. [CHUCKLES] 
 It took me a few minutes to 
 get the courage to come in. 
 It's just us. Sorry. 
 Where two or more are gathered... 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, um, have a seat, please. 
 Hm. 
 Um, hi. 
 I'm Danny. Um... 
 I am an addict. 
 Almost show time. 
 Don't say it like that. 
 You're making me nervous. 
 Be yourself. That's more than enough. 
 Hi, everybody. 
 There's so many of you. 
 That's so good to see. 
 I'm Dr. Jordan Allen, 
 and I am a third-year surgical 
 resident at St. Bonaventure Hospital. 
 Where's Glassy? 
 He will not be staying with us anymore. 
 He moved out? 
 Yes. We had a talk 
 and decided it was best. 
 Did you tell him 
 I was complaining about him? 
 Yes. 
 Oh, Shaun! 
 Now I feel horrible. 
 Oh. You don't need to. 
 He found a vacant apartment 
 just down the hall. 
 In this building? 
 - Yes. 
 - He's our next-door neighbor? 
 Our next-door neighbor's 
 next-door neighbor."
gdoc_6_15,6470478,6,15,"[SIGHS] 
 Stop looking at me. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 Mm, pancakes. The Peanut is thrilled. 
 You are wearing the 
 maternity jeans I bought you. 
 Glad you're happy about that. 
 You're  weeks pregnant. 
 Your weight has increased . pounds, 
 and our baby is moving lower. 
 Hmm. At least there's pancakes. 
 We need to buy a minivan. 
 No, we don't. 
 The Striped Tomato 
 has no infant safety features. 
 Shaun, I just surrendered 
 to maternity jeans. 
 This is not the right time 
 for broaching the ""Mom-mobile."" 
 When would be the right time? 
 These are amazing. 
 - Did you use buttermilk? 
 - Greek yogurt. 
 Mm. 
 I will e-mail you my 
 spreadsheet of child-safe vehicles. 
 We can discuss it on your lunch break. 
 [SAD MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Sonja Baylor? 
 Wait. Who's the Code Gold? 
 Is it Taylor Swift? 
 Did her broken heart finally give out? 
 Better. Roland Barnes. 
 [ENGINE REVS] 
 [ASHER] The green tech guy? 
 He was att*cked by a tiger. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] Sorry. In San Jose? 
 At his exotic animal rescue 
 in the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
 Concierge doctor called to say 
 they're on their way. 
 San Jose General is much closer. 
 - Why would he come here? 
 - [DR. ANDREWS] Because of you. 
 [JARED] Deep chest wall lacerations, 
 multiple rib fractures, 
 hemopneumothorax. 
 I stabilized him and placed a 
 chest tube, but he needs a CT, stat. 
 - Dr. Kalu. 
 - Dr. Andrews. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Good to see you, Dr. Murphy. 
 Oh, hello... Jared. 
 A famous billionaire and a cute reunion? 
 This is almost Swift-worthy. 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ASHER] Is Leo a decent poker player? 
 Us Weekly 
 has photos of Roland 
 coming out of his game last week. 
 Won my Lambo off him. 
 No sign of trauma 
 to the liver or spleen. 
 Ugh. Beyonce did a private show 
 at his birthday? 
 Ah. It was awesome. 
 No major intraperitoneal hematoma. 
 Moving on to the chest. 
 So, how does one go 
 from St. Bon's resident 
 to concierge doctor 
 for the fifth richest man in the world? 
 I was working at Denver Memorial 
 when I met Roland 
 at a fundraiser hosted by my parents. 
 His wife collapsed 
 during the silent auction. 
 Nutmeg allergy. 
 I gave her an epi and helped 
 her to outbid John Legend 
 for a weekend at an underwater hotel. 
 - Well... 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 Roland hired me that night. 
 Why does he need a personal physician? 
 Does he often get att*cked 
 by wild animals? 
 Uh, chronic sciatica. 
 And he travels a lot, you know, 
 so there's vaccines, 
 plus BOTOX injections, 
 cholesterol scripts, 
 medical advice for friends and family. 
 Why'd you leave St. Bon's? 
 He was fired for assaulting an 
 attending who harassed Claire, 
 and then he sued the hospital. 
 - You're that guy. 
 - Yeah. 
 I hear Andrews is, uh, 
 not your biggest fan. 
 Surprised he let me in the building. 
 Depressed and dislocated sternum, 
 manubrium, and rib fractures. 
 They're too fragmented 
 for a standard sternal reconstruction. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - He still does this, huh? 
 - [ASHER] Mm. 
 Always makes my day. 
 I have an idea. 
 This is why I brought Roland here. 
 [ULTRASOUND MONITOR BEEPS] 
 It's a girl. 
 We're naming her Esther. 
 We hope she'll be brave and selfless 
 like Queen Esther, 
 baddest bitch in the Bible. 
 How are the meds going? 
 Fine. 
 Any excessive discharge? 
 Oh, a couple of days ago, 
 I was on a walk, 
 and it was a little like 
 I'd peed myself. 
 Could that be from the MilliDox? 
 No, you're actually on the placebo. 
 Your amniotic fluid is a bit low. 
 We should admit you for further testing. 
 He asked for you. 
 Inoperable leiomyosarcoma 
 with major vascular involvement. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 What are you doing here? 
 I'm dying. 
 My doctors say 
 that there's nothing they can do for me. 
 I'm hoping you can. 
 We should get a CT and a PET scan. 
 Fine. 
 [SHAUN] We will completely rebuild 
 your sternum and anterior chest wall 
 with donor bones and titanium plates. 
 It is a very complicated surgery. 
 Jared says you're a damn good surgeon. 
 Yes, I am a damn good surgeon. 
 [DR. ANDREWS CHUCKLES] He is. 
 And I'll be overseeing your 
 care every step of the way. 
 Appreciate the personal attention. 
 I want Jared there, too. 
 Jared is my doctor. 
 Dr. Kalu will be read in 
 on every major decision. 
 I want him in the OR. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I will fast-track 
 your surgical privileges. 
 [MRI MACHINE WHIRS] 
 Something's going on between you two. 
 I'm very perceptive that way. 
 - It's a long story. 
 - Hmm. 
 I saw on his chart he's from Phoenix, 
 and he broke his arm a couple years ago 
 at a Tae Kwon Do match, your sport. 
 So, I'm gonna go with 
 he's your Johnny Lawrence 
 who cheated during your match 
 at the All Valley tournament. 
 I've been watching a lot of 
 Cobra Kai. 
 He slept with my wife, 
 so yes to the cheating, 
 no to the tournament. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [MOUSE CLICKS] 
 This is from six months ago. 
 This is from today. 
 A leiomyosarcoma should have 
 progressed more than that. 
 Yeah, maybe they had 
 the diagnosis wrong. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Release the pectoral 
 muscles from the attachment medially. 
 [ASHER] Should I place 
 the low-profile plate? 
 [JARED] Don't you need to create 
 a landing zone for the fixation? 
 He is right. 
 Get better exposure by elevating 
 the right pectoral muscle from the ribs. 
 I understand SF General's cardiac unit 
 is named after your boss 
 and that he sponsored a surgical 
 exchange program with Haiti. 
 Dr. Kalu, would you 
 like to place the screws? 
 Very much so. 
 Thank you, Dr. Andrews. 
 Drill guide, self-tapping screws. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - [CHUCKLES] Feels good. 
 - [DRILL WHIRS] 
 You have been very polite to Dr. Kalu, 
 despite having fired him. 
 Is that only because you want 
 a donation from Roland? 
 - [JARED] It's okay. You don't... 
 - [DR. ANDREWS] It's true. 
 Dr. Kalu and I did not part 
 on the best of terms, 
 but I'm happy you found your niche. 
 And I believe in the work we do here, 
 and Roland Barnes 
 can help us do even more. 
 I told Roland this was 
 the best hospital in the state. 
 When we get him healthy, 
 I'll be happy to tell him again. 
 [MONITOR ALARM] 
 BP's dropping. Cardiac output is awful. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] He's in heart failure. 
 The cardiac contusion must 
 have been too small to spot on CT. 
 [SHAUN] He needs a balloon pump 
 to help his heart circulate more blood. 
 And we need to get it in the 
 next five minutes, or he dies. 
 BP has stabilized. 
 Cardiac output is improving. 
 He should make a full recovery, 
 but he should not get so close 
 to jungle cats in the future. 
 In the... In the OR, 
 I really missed that. 
 Then why did you stop being a surgeon? 
 Um, working for Roland 
 was too interesting 
 an opportunity to pass up. 
 Is sciatica interesting to you? 
 No, it's more, um... 
 - I came as soon as I heard. 
 - Hey. 
 Poor Rolly. 
 Uh, Shaun, this is my girlfriend Dalia. 
 Hi. 
 You... 
 I have seen you on the bus 
 in a-a perfume ad. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Fern test confirms 
 it's a premature rupture 
 of the membranes. 
 We should terminate 
 before an infection sets in. 
 What about in-patient expectant 
 management and antibiotics? 
 PPROM pregnancies 
 can be carried to term. 
 Rarely, and when they are, 
 babies are likely to have 
 cerebral palsy, 
 neurologic abnormalities, 
 intellectual disability... 
 Which we'll tell the parents, 
 but this is a badly-wanted pregnancy. 
 They've been trying to conceive 
 for five years, 
 had two first-trimester 
 miscarriages already. 
 Saving the baby may be her priority. 
 But saving her is ours. 
 Sonja is our patient. 
 We should explain her options 
 but recommend termination. 
 Morgan is right, 
 but be clear about the options. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 The seat springs allow the car seat 
 to move more than one inch, 
 which creates additional injury risk. 
 There are no over-shoulder seat 
 belts in the back for the car seat, 
 no crumple zone, and you 
 would have to install a roll cage, 
 which still would not be as 
 reliable as one built into the vehicle. 
 Since you hate minivans, 
 I have looked into hatchbacks and 
 SUVs with sufficient safety features. 
 It's not just about hating minivans. 
 - What is it about? 
 - I love this car. 
 It's my history. 
 My brother and I restored it, 
 used to drive it to shows 
 at The Fillmore. 
 You and I took it on our 
 first road trip. I can't sell it. 
 Then... we do not have to. 
 As long as you never put 
 the Peanut in it. 
 We still need a family car. 
 Yeah, we do. 
 [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
 Roland's awake. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 But it's possible that 
 we could save our baby? 
 You'd have to live here. 
 We'd monitor you every day 
 and give you prophylactic 
 antibiotics and steroids 
 when the baby gets closer to viability. 
 [DR. REZNICK] To be clear, 
 even with all of that, 
 you may still develop 
 a serious uterine infection 
 that could require a hysterectomy 
 or cause fatal complications. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I think we should terminate. 
 What would you do... 
 if it was your baby? 
 Termination is the safest. 
 I was talking to Dr. Allen. 
 I would... 
 pray on it. 
 And then? 
 I want to know what you would do. 
 [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [EXHALES SOFTLY] 
 I think I... 
 would try to save the baby. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 We have to fight for our Esther. 
 [PEREZ] We'd need a biopsy 
 before we can give you 
 any definitive answer. 
 Okay. 
 So, when do we do that? 
 I'll give you a detailed referral 
 to take to another doctor. 
 If I wanted to go to another doctor, 
 I would have. 
 I don't have to keep treating you. 
 But you will. 
 You're not a quitter. 
 You worked your ass off 
 to save your marriage. 
 You never tapped out in a fight. You... 
 I always admired your persistence. 
 I kinda hated it, too. 
 [WISTFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Looking back at my life... 
 I don't like the view. 
 I hurt... a lot of people. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 That's the real reason that I came here. 
 For forgiveness. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 The intra-aortic balloon pump worked. 
 You won't need a new heart. 
 Great. 
 So, when can I get out of here? 
 Oh, not for a few days. 
 We will need to monitor you 
 for post-surgical complications. 
 Your heart rate is elevated. 
 Have you been exerting yourself? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 She did most of the exerting. 
 - [MONITOR ALARM] 
 - Okay. 
 I need , milligrams levetiracetam 
 and  milligrams lorazepam, stat! 
 Is Rolly gonna be okay? 
 [KNOCK ON GLASS] 
 Roland had a seizure. 
 You... should sit down. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Dalia was there. 
 Naked. 
 They were having sex. 
 [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 Dalia and I aren't together. 
 She's with Roland. 
 It's part of the gig. 
 I pretend she's with me so Roland's wife 
 doesn't get suspicious 
 that Dalia's always around. 
 Oh. 
 You think that sex 
 brought on the seizure? 
 Oh. Arousal can increase 
 the heart rate by %, 
 and if his brain 
 was also deprived of oxygen, 
 it could cause a seizure, 
 which would mean his heart 
 is still not pumping enough blood. 
 Does it bother you to have 
 to lie on a regular basis? 
 It's not my favorite responsibility, 
 but it's a great job, so... 
 Why is it a great job? 
 On my last day, Shaun, you told 
 me that one day I will be very happy. 
 But I was miserable. 
 I felt like a failure. 
 And then I met Roland, 
 and he saw something in me, 
 this guy that I really admired, 
 that the world admired. 
 You know, he... he valued me. 
 And I certainly don't mind 
 flying private to Amsterdam 
 to have rijsttafel with 
 the Queen of the Netherlands. 
 I also said you would 
 fulfill your potential. 
 And I'm not doing that? 
 No. 
 Sciatica? 
 Thanks for reminding me 
 I'm still a failure. 
 I'll get the BNP test and echo 
 and check out his heart. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. PARK] Inject saline 
 to get us to submucosal plane. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Why'd you stay on the case? 
 There's the tumor. 
 He was right. 
 I take my obligations seriously. 
 Take four samples. 
 Not because some part of you 
 wants to forgive him? 
 Withdraw the scope slowly. 
 - He doesn't deserve it. 
 - [GLOVES SNAP] 
 Let's start with a sofa. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Let's take a look. 
 Finally, somebody recognizes 
 my interior design genius. 
 Looks nice. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 Hey, I love this. I'll take it. 
 No. 
 This is literally 
 the first thing you've sat on. 
 Okay, I'll sit in ten other ones, 
 and then I'll take this one. 
 No. If you know you like something, 
 stick with it. 
 Like my car. 
 Shaun wants to buy a minivan. 
 And what, you want to put 
 your infant in a ' Gran Torino? 
 No. It's not safe for a baby. 
 But... 
 [SIGHS] it is... 
 cool. 
 Even when I am going 
 to my super grown-up job 
 in my lady-boss pantsuit, 
 I get to get out of that car, 
 and I'm cool. 
 And soon, I will be 
 just another -something mom 
 in a practical car 
 with a baby seat in the back 
 and spit-up on my shirt. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Maddie's mom used to warn me 
 to take two shirts 
 whenever I went out with the baby. 
 - I had to learn the hard way. 
 - How? 
 H-How do I want this baby so badly, 
 but feel so icked out by being a mom? 
 Define ""icked out."" 
 Like... 
 mnh. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - I don't know. 
 Okay, that's well said. 
 [LAUGHS] I don't know. 
 Hey, you got mixed emotions. 
 Welcome to the human condition. 
 I'm gonna take this one. 
 Her fever's hiked. 
 She's in a lot of pain. 
 Her heart rate's . Fetal heart 
 rate . They're both tachycardic. 
 milligrams acetaminophen 
 and start ampicillin. 
 This is the infection 
 we were worried about. 
 Your baby is very unlikely to survive, 
 and your life is in danger. 
 We need to terminate now. 
 But her heart's still beating. 
 Esther can only stay alive in utero, 
 and as long as she's in there, 
 you'll keep getting sicker. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I'm here. We can get through this. 
 We can try again. 
 [SNIFFLES] No. 
 Your baby needs at least 
 two more weeks to be viable, 
 and if we wait that long, 
 you will probably die. 
 ""If I perish, I perish."" 
 That's what Queen Esther said 
 before she risked her life 
 to save her family. 
 Sonja. 
 ""If I perish... 
 I perish."" 
 [DR. ANDREWS] According to 
 your BNP test and echo, 
 your seizure was not related 
 to heart trauma. 
 The EEG will let us assess your brain. 
 So, what's your pitch? 
 Hospital presidents 
 don't supervise EEGs. 
 I've been very impressed 
 by your Global Engineers Initiative, 
 and I think we can do 
 the same thing with medicine, 
 train doctors from the developing world 
 to take care of their own people. 
 What makes St. Bon's the place to do it? 
 We're very hands-on here. 
 Our residents don't just 
 do appies and lap choles. 
 With the guidance of our attendings, 
 they come up with 
 complex treatment solutions, 
 untangle the thorniest ethical dilemmas, 
 and learn how to provide 
 top-notch patient care. 
 If we could sponsor more residents 
 from the developing world, 
 we'll send them home ready 
 to serve their communities. 
 But Jared, who I trust with my life, 
 wasn't good enough to be 
 one of those residents. 
 You fired him. 
 You saw something in him I missed. 
 - Mm. 
 - But I'm seeing it now, 
 and I've granted him full access. 
 That's a very politic answer. 
 What do you think, Jared? 
 Has he earned my money? 
 I learned a tremendous amount 
 here at St. Bon's, 
 and as you've experienced, 
 the care is top-notch. 
 Mm, unfortunately, the food isn't. 
 Oh, text Dalia and ask her to 
 bring us back some of those, um, 
 pork buns from Yank Sing. Ohh. 
 Dalia went into the city? 
 Mm-hmm, to meet up with friends. 
 And you're okay with that? 
 Why wouldn't I be? 
 No reason. 
 Uh, all right. 
 Let's start this. 
 Close your eyes and relax. 
 Labs confirm Sonja has chorioamnionitis. 
 We should add gentamicin. 
 That would damage the baby's kidneys. 
 It's our only way to keep Sonja alive, 
 and it buys us time 
 to convince her to terminate. 
 She's being suicidal. 
 Risking your life for your child 
 is usually considered admirable. 
 Not if you're both going to die... 
 because of the false hope you gave her. 
 I answered a patient's question. 
 You gave her permission. 
 We're supposed to at least 
 try to be objective. 
 Objectivity is a myth, 
 especially on this subject. 
 I know the pain Sonja's grappling with. 
 So do I. 
 I was in med school, on birth control, 
 and I got pregnant anyway. 
 I wasn't ready for a kid. 
 I was scared... 
 and sad... 
 and relieved. 
 It was medical procedure 
 I had years ago, 
 and I'm at peace with it now. 
 Most women are. 
 Because it was their choice. 
 A choice you got to make, 
 and I did, too. 
 Let Sonja make hers. 
 It's not our job 
 to help patients choose death. 
 [CELL PHONES CHIME] 
 Her lungs are failing. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - Her O sets are falling. 
 - Fever's climbing. 
 Intubation cart. 
 Administer propofol and rocuronium. 
 Hey, we need to sedate you 
 so we can intubate. 
 That'll keep you breathing, 
 but the only way to... 
 No. You can't k*ll her. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 Esther's life before mine. 
 - Sonja, please. 
 - Promise me. 
 - I can't. 
 - Promise me. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Anthony. 
 I p... 
 I promise. 
 I love you. 
 Shaun, check out the activity 
 in the left frontal lobe 
 from Roland's EEG. 
 Interictal spikes. 
 They are very small, likely incidental. 
 Hmm. 
 Roland's selfish and possessive. 
 He hates it when people 
 have fun without him, 
 but today he was totally fine with Dalia 
 hanging out with friends 
 while he's stuck here. 
 Being unselfish is a symptom. 
 Maybe one of his wounds got infected. 
 Bacterial encephalitis 
 from the claws or teeth. 
 This could be subtle edema. 
 Plus behavioral changes 
 and interictal spikes. 
 That sounds like neurocysticercosis. 
 - A tapeworm cyst. 
 - With larva in the brain. 
 But it would take a tapeworm weeks 
 to fully form larva 
 and a cyst in his brain. 
 The attack was two days ago. 
 Ooh. 
 Roland's last local safari 
 was about two months ago, 
 and he fell into 
 a giant pile of tiger crap. 
 We can remove the cyst and larva 
 with stereotactic navigation 
 and hydrodissection. 
 - Awesome. 
 - Oh! 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You're not a failure. 
 Seriously? Four guesses? 
 I got it in two. 
 What's up with you? 
 You lose a patient? 
 Actually, I might save one. 
 Joe. 
 Mia's Joe? 
 Waiting on his biopsy results. 
 He asked me to forgive him. 
 What did you say? 
 I refused. 
 You would have, too. 
 Hmm, well, maybe. 
 Then again, I am capable 
 of letting things go. 
 I can let things go. 
 I prioritized my career for a day, 
 which you decided was unacceptable, 
 even after I changed my mind. 
 And how long did it take you 
 to forgive Mia? 
 Dr. Park. 
 Your diagnosis is in. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [CLATTERING] 
 [DR. GLASSMAN, MUFFLED] 
 Right this way, guys. 
 Be careful. You've got history 
 you're carrying right there. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 There's a couple of steps. Be careful. 
 Thanks, guys. First door on the right. 
 Stadium seats? 
 Authentic Candlestick Park 
 stadium seats. 
 Got them from a broker. 
 - Very cool. 
 - Right? 
 - Thank you for the inspiration. 
 - You're welcome. 
 Your turn next. Get your coat. 
 You have a stromal tumor in your stomach 
 and a small lesion on your liver. 
 And we can remove both. 
 [PEREZ] You'll be cancer-free. 
 Hmm. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] 
 T-That's incredible. 
 Thank you. 
 You get it, right? 
 You're not dying. 
 Yes. 
 This is amazing. 
 I'm so grateful. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 - But it... 
 - That's not why you came here. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Sonja will likely 
 be in multi-organ failure 
 within the next  hours. 
 And when that happens, 
 Esther will not survive. 
 But if we terminate now, 
 Sonja still can. 
 You can save your wife's life. 
 It's all up to you.

 And I believe God picked you

 You're being sued for malpractice. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It wasn't Dr. Glassman."

 How many times have you been sued? 
 Twice, just twice. 
 But when you run a hospital, 
 it's good to know a good lawyer. 
 Aaron! 
 Janet, hi. 
 Oh, my gosh. Did it happen? 
 Did you play Pebble Beach? 
 I did, and it was the worst 
 mistake of my life. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - Hello. 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy 
 of San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. 
 - Your client. 
 - Yes. 
 Aaron has told me a lot about you. 
 Congratulations on all you... 
 Is this billable time? 
 It is. 
 But it will be paid for 
 by your insurance company. 
 And I have good news. 
 $   ,    that will be paid 
 by your malpractice insurance. 
 All you have to do 
 is sign some documents 
 and agree to 
 a six-month supervisory period. 
 You can still practice medicine. 
 It just means another doctor 
 would have to sign off 
 on all your decisions. 
 Excuse me. 
 That is not good news. 
 Can it be anyone? 
 Anyone qualified. 
 So Park, M-Morgan. 
 It could be anyone you trust. 
 Could be me. 
 I have worked very hard 
 to be an attending 
 to prove that I don't need 
 anyone's approval 
 to do what I think should be done. 
 Which is often different 
 from what Dr. Park, or Morgan, 
 or you think should be done. 
 Also... it is very humiliating. 
 - What if he says no? 
 - We go to trial. 
 And if he loses at trial? 
 The money will still be paid 
 by the insurance company. 
 But the bigger issue is that a report, 
 and the court's decision, 
 will be sent to 
 the California Medical Board, 
 and they will make 
 a decision about whether... 
 you have a future as a doctor. 
 I'll settle. 
 I need to go to the bathroom. 
 Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. 
 You're Dr. Shaun Murphy, 
 - Miss Stewart's   :   a.m.? 
 - Yes, hello. 
 My name is Joni DeGroot. 
 Um... I'm curious about cancer patients 
 whose exposure came from formaldehyde 
 in pressed wood office furniture. 
 Have you had a case like that? 
 No. Nor have I read about that. 
 If you have a case where 
 that is alleged, 
 - I would not be a good consultant. 
 - It's not for a case. 
 It's... 
 Thank you. Thank you, 
 thank you, Dr. Murphy. 
 Tell Miss Stewart to review my update 
 on Carter v. Willis 
 before finalizing your NDA. 
 The Idaho District Court made 
 the stare decisis vulnerable. 
 Are you working on my case? 
 You should not be in here. 
 This is my office. 
 No one is supposed 
 to come into my office. 
 Okay. 
 I'm not officially on your case. 
 But I read the file. 
 It was amazing how you created 
 arterial clamps 
 out of pieces of an aluminum can. 
 Yes. Why is everything 
 covered in plastic? 
 They're getting ready to paint. 
 Oh, I thought it was because 
 of your obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
 I used to have a closet for an office. 
 Did you choose this 
 instead of sharing an office? 
 - It's not a closet. It's an office. 
 - It is very small. 
 Even smaller than my closet. 
 This is all I need. 
 I don't meet with clients. 
 And it's very private, 
 so I'm not disturbed 
 while I'm doing my research... 
 Or your rituals. 
 Nice to meet you, Joni DeGroot. 
 You're settling your case? 
 Yes. 
 Miss Stewart and Dr. Glassman 
 say it is for the best. 
 Your settlement includes

 We were on Hellyer, 
 coming through the wooded

 and between the rain and the turns, 
 I was driving pretty slowly. 
 [THUNDER RUMBLES] 
 Good thing... 
 there was a car in the road.

 He is bleeding from his radial artery.

 Okay, Bob.

 What? 
 You didn't bring him that way. 
 Oh. Yes, I did.

 It was a scoff. 
 Why would you scoff at the truth? 
 What truth? 
 There's only one. 
 There's a single correct answer 
 to any question. 
 But there are a lot of questions. 
 You're asking, ""What was 
 the right thing to do then, 
 given what you know now?"" 
 Which is a stupid question. 
 I don't like to use the word ""stupid."" 
 ""Desperate"" then. For an answer. 
 But whatever that test says, 
 we have to share it with the other side. 
 If it goes the way you want, 
 we will definitely win your case. 
 If it goes the other way, 
 we will definitely lose your case. 
 But neither result will tell 
 you if you did the right thing, 
 given what you knew at the time.

 Do you believe in that test

 No. No, you may not. 
 You are just here to argue this motion,

 Thank you, Your Honor. 
 It wasn't completely a compliment. 
 Dr. Murphy cannot be held liable 
 for professional misconduct 
 because Dr. Murphy 
 was not acting 
 in a professional capacity. 
 He was a Good Samaritan. 
 [JUDGE KILEEN] And 
 you're taking the position 
 that The Good Samaritan 
 exception stayed in effect 
 even after the ambulance arrived? 
 [JONI] Yes, because he didn't do 
 the amputation 
 in 
 the ambulance. 
 He was 
 outside 
 the ambulance. 
 He 
 chose 
 not to do the 
 amputation in the ambulance.

 Do you know why her office is a closet? 
 Joni has had issues 
 since she started here. 
 She was late a lot. 
 Her first assignment, 
 her first motion, she missed it. 
 She must have had a good reason. 
 She saw someone drowning. 
 Oh. 
 She was on her way to court, 
 driving by the bay, 
 and she saw something. 
 She stopped, called the police. 
 They shut down the road, 
 searched the water. 
 Joni knew she saw... 
 a log, a wave... nothing. 
 But her mind wouldn't let her 
 accept that it was nothing. 
 We found out this had happened 
 twice before. 
 Why didn't you fire her? 
 Because she threatened to sue us, 
 arguing that firing her 
 would be a violation 
 of the American's With Disabilities Act. 
 - Was it? 
 - I'm not sure. I don't think so. 
 But this brief that she wrote... 
 most impressive thing I've ever read.

 because she doesn't need to meet

 research. 
 Just research.

 She stuffed you in a closet.

 You know she's done more. 
 She hired me. She saved...

 A lawyer saved our family. 
 Our father died in a car

 That's when my OCD started. 
 I was very worried

 Mm.

 Bad things happened.

 our mother, some overworked 
 social workers, 
 some foster parents, a judge. 
 But one person 
 made it all right again... 
 a lawyer. 
 Joni... 
 I still want you as my lawyer. 
 Dr. Murphy, I made a huge mistake. 
 Because... 
 I have a problem. 
 We all have problems. 
 I'll talk to Janet. 
 Dr. Murphy wants you as first chair. 
 So you're first chair. 
 - I'm first chair? 
 - You are not first chair. 
 I'm not first chair. 
 You are a figurehead. 
 You will sit in your first chair 
 and you will not say a word. 
 You will not stand up. 
 You will not object. 
 If you have to tap, 
 you will tap quietly... 
 on your leg. 
 Now wish me luck. 
 Good luck. 
 [ROSS] In your expert opinion, 
 when Dr. Murphy 
 concluded that my client's hand 
 was irreversibly damaged 
 and needed to be amputated... 
 He was wrong. 
 The lack of blood flow was caused 
 by a temporary condition 
 known as vasospasm, 
 which can occur after a trauma 
 such as a car accident. 
 Vessels temporarily clamp down, 
 cutting off the flow of blood. 
 In this case, Mr. Patton's 
 ulnar artery spasmed. 
 And this condition is treatable? 
 Yes... with an injection 
 of calcium channel blocker, 
 which was available 
 in the ambulance that night. 
 Hm. 
 [ROSS] Thank you. 
 Your witness. 
 [SOFTLY] Any last minute ideas? 
 Anything we can challenge him 
 on medically? 
 It wasn't vasospasm. 
 Anything we could prove? 
 No. 
 [JANET] Dr. Rutenberg, 
 are you being paid 
 by the Plaintiff's attorney 
 for your testimony today? 
 I am. 
 [DISTORTED] Then you can hardly 
 consider yourself unbiased, can you? 
 [DR. RUTENBERG] It's routine 
 for experts to be paid. 
 You're being paid. 
 [JANET] And I admit, I am biased... 
 Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. 
 Traumatic vasospasm doesn't 
 occur in isolated vessels, 
 but rather the entire 
 affected limb, right? 
 Yes, of course. 
 Can you visually identify 
 a damaged or occluded vessel 
 versus one in vasospasm? 
 Yes. 
 So... 
 this one? 
 Occluded. 
 Vasospasm. 
 Vasospasm. 
 Occluded. 
 Not vasospasm? 
 - No. 
 - Objection, Your Honor. 
 Is this testimony or the MCAT? 
 Goes to the witness' expertise. 
 Oh, he's definitely an expert. 
 That last photo, 
 which did not show vasospasm, 
 that was a pathology image 
 of Mr. Patton's radial artery. 
 And if his radial artery 
 didn't vasospasm, 
 then according to your expert testimony, 
 his ulnar artery didn't either. 
 Is that correct? 
 [SIGHS] It's possible. 
 But we'd only know for sure 
 if Dr. Murphy 
 had given the calcium channel blocker. 
 - I'm sorry. 
 - You're not great at taking direction, 
 are you? 
 - No, I shouldn't... 
 - And you only still have a job 
 - because you threatened to sue us. 
 - I'm sorry! 
 I'm not wanted in a lot of places. 
 I make people feel uncomfortable. 
 If I let that stop me, 
 I wouldn't be anywhere. 
 At my first job, 
 I was the only female associate. 
 Tomorrow... 
 you're first chair. 
 Actual first chair. 
 Good luck. 
 Nice work. This is good stuff. 
 - Thank you. 
 - The carpal tunnel research 
 is really interesting. 
 A pre-existing condition 
 mitigates our client's respon... 
 I'm not gonna use that. 
 It could help reduce damages. 
 If damages are even $ , 
 it means Dr. Murphy was negligent, 
 which means his medical license 
 would be at risk. 
 We need total victory. 
 Okay. So what's your theory on this? 
 How are you going to approach 
 this witness? 
 I'm going to establish that he's a d*ck. 
 I can't do my job. 
 I can't even hold my niece. 
 [ROSS] Thank you. 
 No more questions, Your Honor. 
 Dr. Murphy saved your life. 
 Is that a question? 
 Not really. Seems pretty obvious. 
 - I meant... 
 - I know what you meant. I'll rephrase. 
 What kind of person sues 
 a person who saved their life? 
 Do you sue people who buy you 
 Christmas presents 
 you don't want, or only the weird ones 
 you figure the jury won't like? 
 Objection... compound and argumentative. 
 Sustained. 
 I'm the victim here. 
 You were driving, right? 
 - Yes. 
 - Over the speed limit? 
 I'm not sure. 
 According to police analysis 
 of your skid marks... 
 Yes. A little. 
 ...you were going 
 at least    in    zone. 
 - You were ejected out the car window? 
 - Yes. 
 So you weren't wearing a seat belt? 
 - I'm not sure. 
 - It was fastened behind you. 
 [SIGHS] Yes. 
 So all things considered, 
 maybe a better adjective 
 than ""victim"" would be ""lucky"". 
 Withdrawn. 
 Do you feel any guilt over any of this? 
 You're asking me if I feel guilty 
 about wanting to be 
 compensated for losing... 
 [JONI] No. I am asking you 
 if you feel guilty 
 about driving recklessly, 
 flipping your car, 
 and almost k*lling your sister... 
 the mother of your niece? 
 Yeah, a little. 
 Is she suing you f...

 Don't win cheap. 
 You're better than this... 
 I am fighting for my client. 
 If she can't handle a little adversity, 
 then she shouldn't be here. 
 Don't let that d*ck 
 prove people like me right.

 - Hey, hey, hey. 
 Miss Stewart, 
 I will hold you in contempt. 
 [CHAIR SQUEAKS] 
 If Dr. Murphy had been a not nice person 
 and just driven on, you'd be dead. 
 And his career wouldn't 
 hang in the balance. 
 [ROSS] Uh, objection. 
 - Calls for speculation. 
 - Not a lot. 
 The objection is sustained. 
 Miss Stewart, 
 I am finding you in contempt. 
 That stunt just cost you $ ,   . 
 You're lucky it's not as*ault. 
 Now, Miss DeGroot... 
 you may continue. 
 - Thank you, Your Honor. 
 - Thank you, Your Honor. 
 [JONI] Mr. Patton, the night 
 of the accident... 
 - Hey. 
 - I'm so sorry. 
 - I know that it happened again... 
 - Shut up. 
 You're doing fantastic. 
 But you still have Murphy's testimony. 
 We need the jury to like him. 
 They need to think he did nothing wrong. 
 Have you given thought to how 
 you're gonna do that? 
 Yes. I have. 
 Did you do anything wrong 
 at the scene of the accident? 
 Objection. Leading. 
 Yes. 
 Withdrawn. 
 I did four things wrong. 
 I applied the tourniquet 
 at the brachial artery 
 instead of mid-forearm. 
 I laid out the clamps 
 after 
 the makeshift vascular clips. 
 I only did two wipe downs 
 of the surgical field, 
 and I angled the spinal board 
 as I moved Mr. Patton 
 out of the woods 
 because a log was in the way. 
 Were any of those mistakes relevant? 
 They were to me. 
 But I don't believe they 
 affected the patient's outcome. 
 [JONI] Given where you sit today, 
 right now, 
 do you think one of the things that you 
 and Dr. Park did wrong... 
 was stopping? 
 No. Then Mr. Patton would be dead. 
 [JONI] And the amputation, 
 was that the right thing to do? 
 I don't know. 
 But I know that if I had 
 to do it all over again... 
 I would stop, 
 I would help, 
 and I would amputate. 
 Dr. Murphy, you're different. 
 Tell me about yourself. 
 Objection. Vague and irrelevant. 
 Your challenges, 
 the obstacles you've overcome... 
 Marginally less vague, 
 still completely irrelevant. 
 And yet, I will allow. 
 I have autism spectrum disorder. 
 I have always had 
 autism spectrum disorder. 
 I have also always wanted 
 to be a doctor. 
 Many people thought that 
 couldn't happen, but I saved... 
 [MUTTERING] 
 Hi. 
 I think I'm better at asking 
 questions than giving speeches. 
 Closings are tricky. 
 It helps to actually say the words, 
 not just mutter them. [CHUCKLES] 
 Can I say them now? 
 You want my feedback? 
 If I don't like it, I'm going to tell 
 you, bluntly. 
 You know that, right? 
 'Cause you've been so tactful 
 with me up till now? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 My mentor told me that 
 criminal law is about justice, 
 whereas civil law is about 
 one thing and one thing only... 
 money. 
 You can't undo what's been done. 
 The best you can do 
 is compensate, financially. 
 But that's wrong. 
 Everything we do in this room 
 is about justice. 
 We can't change what's happened, 
 but maybe, just maybe, 
 we can change what will happen. 
 We can encourage people to care, 
 to care about strangers, to care... 
 That's not your closing. 
 - It's a good closing. 
 - It's a very good closing. 
 It was your closing. A long time ago. 
 My mentor said that to me. 
 I developed it into an effective clos... 
 Did you believe it? 
 About justice? 
 That we can change the future? 
 I did. 
 But not anymore? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Maybe if 
 my 
 mentor gave me advice, 
 I could turn it into 
 something effective. 
 You consider me a mentor? 
 You did inspire me. 
 I will [CHUCKLES] 
 give you one piece of advice. 
 You're not me. 
 Not once in this trial have you done 
 what I would've done. 
 Or what I wanted you to do. 
 So far, it's worked. 
 I see no reason to change now. 
 My mentor told me... 
 My mentor told me... 
 My mentor told me... 
 that people don't like me. 
 That I make them uncomfortable. 
 She's right. 
 And people don't like my client either. 
 We're different. 
 But we're all different. 
 You... You've worn purple 
 every day of this trial. 
 I assume because you love it. 
 And 'cause you want it 
 to be your ""thing."" 
 You've got those mutton chops. 
 They're great. They're fun. 
 They make you... you. 
 But when we start to get 
 judged based on our differences, 
 it's not fun anymore. 
 And fair enough, this is a courtroom. 
 You are literally here 
 to judge my client. 
 But please don't judge him 
 based on the way that he talks, 
 or on how he doesn't look at you, 
 or on his awkward mannerisms. 
 Judge him... 
 on who he is. 
 At every moment of his life, 
 he has tried to make a difference, 
 tried to make things a little better. 
 Please don't punish him for that. 
 Please... 
 do what the plaintiff should've done. 
 Say thank you.

 You should've used propofol

 Versed is old school. 
 Same effects, none of the overshooting. 
 Why are you changing my settings? 
 Peds case. 
 Shorter duration imaging 
 sequences cuts the time in half. 
 It's your first day, remember? 
 You could probably use a

 [CHUCKLES] 
 Shaun will appreciate getting 
 Yara's results back faster. 
 Trust me. 
 You know him better than me. 
 [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Was the patient properly sedated 
 before you began this MRI? 
 Yeah, of course. I used the standard 
 pediatric protocol with Versed. 
 Did Dr. Allen tell you about 
 our revised propofol protocol? 
 Yeah. But in my experience, 
 Versed provides better... 
 You should have listened to Dr. Allen. 
 I know how to perform an MRI, Shaun. 
 You apparently do not. 
 There is too much motion degradation. 
 These images are unusable. 
 Dr. Allen, please go redo the MRI. 
 Dr. Kalu, we need to speak privately. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You cannot take shortcuts. 
 You're right. I'm sorry. 
 You cannot expect special 
 treatment because you are my friend. 
 I'm not expecting 
 special treatment, Shaun. 
 But I don't appreciate being 
 treated like an intern, either. 
 I know, technically, I'm a first year, 
 but I've been a doctor 
 for as long as you have. 
 We are not peers. 
 I am your boss, 
 and you have a lot to learn. 
 Dr. Andrews said he is judging my 
 performance off of your performance,

 Okay? 
 Okay. 
 Good. You need

 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. LIM] Heart block plus 
 inverted cardiac anatomy. 
 What's your plan? 
 Intravenous pacemaker is out, 
 but we could open him up, 
 place it surgically. 
 [ASHER] That doesn't address 
 the underlying anatomy issue. 
 The defect could lead to 
 heart failure as he gets older. 
 It could, but he might be fine 
 with just the pacemaker. 
 But if he's already developed 
 arrhythmia, not a great sign. 
 I'd recommend 
 the double switch reconstruction, 
 redirect blood flow 
 to the right ventricle. 
 I have Carter's BMP and cardiac labs. 
 Yeah, I already received them digitally. 
 But the hard copies 
 are always appreciated. 
 - Trouble in paradise? 
 - Everything's fine. 
 They've been in this 
 passive-aggressive fight all day. 
 We're not fighting. 
 No, 
 that would require you talking to me. 
 You don't have to share, 
 but you do have two divorcees 
 with a sadly ample amount 
 of experience between us. 
 Was one of you secretly 
 in contact with an ex? 
 Took a job out of state without 
 including you in the process? 
 Jerome lied to me, 
 about something very important. 
 - I didn't lie. 
 - A lie of omission is still a lie. 
 - It's not that simple. 
 - You should have told me. 
 - I wanted to. 
 - Yes, but you didn't. 
 Because I was afraid of how you'd react. 
 But you're right. 
 It should never have been a secret, 
 because there's nothing to hide. 
 I'm HIV positive. 
 Thanks to my meds, my viral load 
 has been undetectable for years. 
 I'm poz undetectable. 
 I can't transmit the virus. 
 [GLOOMY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You should go talk to him. 
 I have work to do. 
 Present the double switch 
 surgery to the family. 
 If they agree, I'll scrub in. 
 On it. 
 No. How did we get from a 
 pacemaker to reconstructing his heart? 
 The procedure may sound drastic, 
 but it will greatly reduce his 
 risk of developing heart failure. 
 Can't we just give him 
 the pacemaker now, 
 and do the bigger surgery 
 if the problem gets worse? 
 At the point he starts showing 
 signs of heart failure, 
 it'll be too late 
 to do the reconstruction. 
 We should fix it now. 
 This isn't your decision. 
 You are still making me pay for 
 mistakes I made when I was   . 
 And   ,   ,   ... 
 I've been back for two years. 
 How can I be a mother when 
 you won't even give me a chance? 
 [CARTER] Mama?

 [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 I wanted to apologize for earlier. 
 It was unprofessional. 
 You have nothing to apologize for, 
 and no duty to disclose. 
 Undetectable equals untransmittable. 
 [SIGHS] I appreciate you saying that. 
 Give Asher some time. 
 He's a doctor. 
 He knows there was 
 never any risk to him. 
 What people know 
 and how it makes them feel 
 are often two very different things. 
 You've had years to process your status. 
 Allow Asher to process it, too. 
 Please do not say, ""I told you so."" 
 I won't. But I'm gonna think it. 
 You seem a little spoiled. 
 You don't know me. 
 You come from money, 
 and you haven't had to 
 work hard for 
 anything. 
 You made it through med school. 
 Bravo to that. 
 You got kicked out of this program, 
 but landed on your feet 
 taking care of a billionaire. 
 And when you got tired of that, 
 you were welcomed back here 
 with open arms. 
 You come in with your fancy car 
 and your old tricks, and think, 
 ""Ta-da, I'm a surgeon,"" 
 but you're not. Yet. 
 You're the new kid. 
 Shaun is the boss, and I have seniority. 
 You should listen to Kendrick. 
 Be humble.

 The image is still not 
 high enough resolution. 
 Have you finished redoing the imaging? 
 Yes, and I followed all the protocols, 
 but the image still doesn't look clear. 
 The image is clear, 
 but Yara's diagnosis was incorrect. 
 She does not have Tourette's. 
 She has a brain tumor. 
 [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I 
 don't 
 have Tourette's? 
 No, you have a hypothalamic hamartoma. 
 Your tics aren't tics. 
 They are gelastic seizures 
 caused by the tumor in your brain. 
 Tumor? Does that mean cancer? 
 The tumor is not cancerous. 
 But a Gamma Knife radiosurgery 
 should stop it from growing 
 and treat the seizures. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Will it stop [GRUNTS] 
 this? 
 Not immediately. 
 And possibly not at all. 
 There are other options you can consider 
 in the future 
 if you don't see improvement. 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Or we could consider them now. 
 A successful resection 
 could stop the seizures immediately. 
 That procedure is very risky. 
 But that means I can go back to school. 
 I could learn how to drive. 
 I could take care of myself. 
 Mommy, please. 
 I just want to be normal. 
 Tumor resection can cause stroke, 
 partial paralysis, 
 learning deficits, meningitis. 
 The Gamma Knife is much safer. 
 - Yara, I'm sorry. I can't. 
 - You 
 can. 
 You just won't let me. 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 Please go ahead 
 and schedule the Gamma Knife procedure.

 I'm afraid of exposing Carter

 What trauma? 
 He was left by his mother. 
 - I left him with you. 
 - Expecting me to pick up all the pieces 
 and fix everything, like always. 
 I knew he was safer with you 
 than with me. 
 But I didn't know that. 
 I gave you too much freedom, 
 wasn't involved enough, 
 and look what happened. 
 My mistakes were mine, not yours. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 I was supposed to protect you. 
 And we lost you. 
 I have to do better for Carter. 
 Well, the surgery is what's 
 best for Carter, long-term.

 I thought it would be fun 
 working with a friend. 
 It is not fun. It is difficult. 
 I do not want people to think 
 I am giving Dr. Kalu special treatment, 
 because I am not 
 giving him special treatment. 
 In fact, I am being very firm 
 because he has already 
 made several errors, 
 and I do not understand why. 
 Well, he's a new resident 
 on his first day. 
 There has to be 
 a bit of a learning curve. 
 Mm, he is not acting

 Well, he's your friend. 
 And he knows you expect a lot of him. 
 No one can follow the rules

 Oh. I have found a solution, as well. 
 I have made a list 
 of boundaries and rules 
 to make our working relationship better. 
 You need to study them. 
 What have you found a solution for? 
 I think I found a better 
 resection technique. 
 Has a lower risk profile, 
 closer to that 
 of the Gamma Knife radiation. 
 And it offers a better outcome for Yara. 
 I presented the safest option 
 to the patient, 
 which she agreed to. 
 And you should not have presented the 
 tumor resection 
 without consulting me. 
 That is an important boundary. 
 Number two on the list. 
 I thought you'd be happy I was 
 thinking outside the box, like you. 
 You are not me. You are here to learn. 
 Yes. I'm also here 
 to help people like Yara. 
 You need to respect 
 that I am your attending. 
 Number six on the list. 
 I don't have to be an attending 
 to know that she's sad, 
 lonely, and depressed. 
 We cannot make medical decisions 
 based off of the patient's emotions. 
 Well, sometimes the emotions 
 are just as important as the medical.

 After my diagnosis, 
 it took a long time for me 
 to feel comfortable dating, 
 or even being around people. 
 I spent so much time alone, 
 and when I finally put myself 
 back out there, 
 there was a lot of rejection. 
 Guys just didn't want to deal 
 with my status. 
 So, when this adorable, 
 brilliant doctor popped into my life, 
 and I liked him so much... 
 I was too scared to tell him the truth. 
 I'm sorry. 
 This doctor sounds pretty great. 
 He is. 
 I made sure we always used protection, 
 encouraged you to stay on PrEP. 
 All to make sure that you were safe. 
 That was a decision that 
 you made for the both of us. 
 You did all those things 
 to make yourself feel better 
 while you took away my choice. 
 How could you have known me and loved me 
 and think that this is something 
 that I-I couldn't accept? 
 When I first had to make this decision, 
 I didn't love you. 
 [SCOFFS] I barely knew you. 
 And I'm not sure I know you now. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I made a mistake. 
 That doesn't change who I am. 
 No, but maybe it changes how I feel. 
 I'm sorry that I put you through this,

 A kink in Carter's reconstructed 
 atria caused the clot in his heart. 
 He's stable, but he needs 
 another operation 
 to remove the clot 
 and repair the conduit. 
 Are there other alternatives? 
 We could use a catheter to 
 dissolve the blockage with medication, 
 but that still leaves the risk of a 
 clot forming again down the line. 
 I knew doing this 
 was the wrong decision. 
 We both want what's best for Carter. 
 But I'm the one 
 who is responsible for him. 
 And I'm sorry I put that on you. 
 I will never forgive myself 
 for losing 
 out on those years of Carter's life, 
 but I've realized that I need 
 to try to let go of that. 
 Let go of my regret 
 and focus on what I know, 
 that leaving him with you 
 was 
 the best decision for him. 
 That will never change. 
 And this surgery is the 
 right decision for him, too.

 You're his mother. 
 You know what's best for Carter. 
 I want my son to have the surgery.

 I came out of the gate too hot, 
 annoyed Shaun, 
 screwed things up for Yara. 
 Agree. 
 I gotta figure out my next move. 
 Listen. 
 This whole case, 
 you've been pitching and shortcutting 
 and trying to be Mr. Fix-it 
 for everything. 
 Stop flexing and listen. 
 [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 [LAUGHING] 
 Mom, let me try the tumor 
 resection surgery. Please. 
 I'm sorry. No. 
 - We're ready for you. 
 - [LAUGHING] 
 All right, baby. 
 [LAUGHING CONTINUES] 
 But first, I, um... 
 [CLICKS TONGUE] 
 want you to tell your mom 
 what you told me, 
 about what you're dealing with. 
 What this surgery means to you. 
 I know what she's dealing with. 
 I see it every day. 
 But have you listened 
 to how it feels to her? 
 She doesn't care. 
 Of course I do. 
 You just want to boss me around. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 I'm just trying to help, 
 but no matter what I do, 
 you're always so angry at me. 
 I'm angry... 
 [LAUGHS] 
 I'm angry at everything. 
 I'm angry at my body for 
 not doing what I want it to do. 
 I'm angry at other kids for being jerks. 
 And I'm angry at you... 
 for acting like the only way 
 for me to survive in this world 
 is by you protecting me. 
 I feel like I'm a puppet 
 and somebody else is 
 constantly pulling the strings, 
 yanking me all around. 
 Getting this tumor removed 
 is the only way for me 
 to cut the strings. 
 [GLOOMY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Okay, don't... don't... 
 don't take her yet. 
 We need to talk. 
 [SOBBING, LAUGHING] 
 I need you to scrub in 
 on a hypothalamic hamartoma surgery. 
 Okay. 
 I had planned to use 
 Gamma Knife radiation, 
 but Dr. Kalu violated rule number two, 
 and now we have to do 
 his tumor resection. 
 You're upset with Jared 
 because he changed your surgical plan? 
 He overstepped with me 
 and the patient and her mother. 
 Well, a tumor resection 
 seems like a pretty good idea. 
 Are you planning on letting 
 Jared scrub in? 
 Yes, he will be on suction. 
 That's an insult. 
 He has to learn to follow rules. 
 He has made my job very difficult. 
 Shaun, sit down. 
 When you were a resident, 
 you did things completely your own way. 
 You still do. 
 You rubbed everybody the wrong way. 
 You made everybody's job more difficult, 
 especially mine. 
 You were a pain in the ass. 
 But we gave you the space to learn, 
 and we learned from you. 
 And you turned yourself into an asset. 
 Give Jared the same opportunity. 
 Okay, he overstepped. 
 Give him a chance to learn 
 and to prove himself to be an asset. 
 Even if you think 
 he's a pain in the ass. 
 I will take it into consideration. 
 Okay. 
 Please scrub in for that surgery. 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SHAUN] Advance the catheter and 
 endoscope gently into the ventricle. 
 Suction and irrigate more aggressively 
 so she can see what she is doing. 
 [MACHINE SUCTIONING] 
 Proceed along the midline posteroinferior 
 floor of the third ventricle. 
 Oh, there's the tumor. 
 We can begin excision. 
 Bipolar scissors. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Micro forceps. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 I'll take the specimen to pathology. 
 [SHAUN] No. 
 You are going to close. 
 Are you sure? 
 This was your surgical plan. 
 You will become a better surgeon 
 by getting a fair shot to be an asset. 
 I will take the specimen. 
 Dr. Glassman will supervise. 
 [GENTLE UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 I'm hungry. 
 That's a very good sign. 
 I'll run down to the cafe 
 and grab him some food. 
 Any restrictions? 
 He can have as many 
 chicken nuggets as he wants. 
 I'll go down. 
 I'll get something for you to eat, too. 
 You haven't left his side 
 since we got here. 
 Comes with being a good mom. 
 I had a great teacher. 
 You know, a little birdie told me 
 that the gift shop 
 just got in the latest volume 
 of Wonder Woman. 
 Really? Can we get it? 
 If your mom is okay with it. 
 Of course. 
 But no twirling just yet, okay? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Dr. Murphy was able 
 to remove all of the tumor. 
 Yara? 
 Dr. Kalu. 
 Memory is intact. 
 The light didn't provoke a seizure. 
 And your tics are gone. 
 Thank you, Dr. Kalu. 
 Thank you, Yara. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Dr. Andrews. 
 I heard about your work 
 on the Fields case. Good job. 
 Thank you. 
 I just came in to ask you for a favor. 
 Please judge me for my work, 
 and not Shaun. 
 Shaun's part of the reason 
 you're back here. 
 And I appreciate him for that. 
 But I want to stand on my own. 
 And if I sink, I don't want 
 to take my friend down with me. 
 I'm ready to prove myself 
 as an asset to this hospital. 
 I'll be watching. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm sorry for being such a jerk. 
 You opened yourself up, and I shut down. 
 And I should've trusted you 
 that we could figure this out together. 
 Yesterday, you said you didn't know me. 
 That adorable doctor can be 
 kind of an ass sometimes. 
 I've never been in love before you. 
 When I was   , 
 I'm pretty sure I ran over a raccoon, 
 but I didn't stop to check 
 because I 
 was running late to a baseball game. 
 Also... 
 I love a pumpkin spice latte. 
 - Ugh. 
 - Even though I know it's basic. 
 You know those cufflinks I wore 
 to Shaun and Lea's wedding? 
 - Yeah. 
 - [INHALES DEEPLY] 
 I bought them for you, but I liked 
 them so much, 
 I kept them for myself. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 That explains so much. 
 But you can totally borrow them... 
 sometime, probably not. 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 I love you. 
 I need you to believe that. 
 [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Just, uh, came to say good night. 
 And thank you. 
 Why are you thanking me? 
 For not going easy on me. 
 I was wrong to expect that, 
 even if we are friends. 
 You are a good doctor. 
 And I would like to continue 
 to be your friend 
 and your boss... 
 with boundaries. 
 You're right. 
 And I'm studying your list. 
 Oh, there is one rule 
 that is not on the list. 
 It is a rule for me. 
 I will refer to you 
 as ""Dr. Kalu"" 
 when I am being your boss 
 and as ""Jared"" 
 when we are in friend mode. 
 Yeah, that works for me, Shaun. 
 Good. 
 Jared, I would like 
 to take you out for drinks 
 to celebrate you 
 being back at Saint Bon's, 
 but Dr. Kalu, 
 when I checked on Yara postoperatively, 
 I noticed you only used eight sutures 
 when you closed and 
 she had a small bleed. 
 You should have used ten. 
 You need to go work 
 on your suturing technique. 
 Happy to... to practice, 
 but I only replaced the small bone flap. 
 Dr. Glassman closed the galea and skin. 
 Dr. Glassman skipped two sutures? 
 I guess so. 
 Um, meet you for drinks in an hour? 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay.

 Yeah, these early calls are 
 gonna take some getting used to. 
 [SHAUN] Browne retractor. 
 No Browne retractor. 
 [JARED] I thought I put it on 
 your tray from the supply room. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Dr. Kalu is not your peer. 
 He's your employee, 
 and you are his boss. 
 I do not plan to give Jared 
 special treatment. 
 And if I see it, it won't 
 be good for either of you. 
 I'm not expecting 
 special treatment, Shaun, 
 but I don't appreciate being 
 treated like an intern either. 
 Dr. Andrews said he is judging my 
 performance off of your performance, 
 and your performance is not good. 
 [JORDAN] You come in with your fancy car 
 and your old tricks and think, 
 ""Ta-da, I'm a surgeon,"" but you're not. 
 I just want to prove that I belong here. 
 When I checked on Yara post-operatively, 
 I noticed you only used 
 eight sutures when you closed, 
 and she had a small bleed. 
 You should have used ten. 
 Dr. Glassman closed the galea and skin. 
 - Dr. Glassman skipped two sutures? 
 - Guess so. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [ELEVATOR CHIMES] 
 At what time did you wake up 
 yesterday morning? 
 The usual,  :  . Why? 
 At lunch, you had a Cobb 
 salad with balsamic vinaigrette, 
 so that's     calories ingested, 
 assuming you kept it down. 
 Yes, I kept it down. 
 Did you use a sauna, 
 engage in rigorous exercise, 
 and/or experience diarrhea? 
 No, I didn't do any of those things. 
 What's with the questions, Shaun? 
 You made an error 
 in yesterday's craniotomy. 
 I'm trying to evaluate various factors 
 that would negatively impact focus. 
 I made an error? 
 You closed with only eight sutures. 
 The size of the wound required ten. 
 We need to figure out why. 
 Why do we need to figure out why? 
 Two sutures, it's a blip. 
 It's not a thing. 
 It could be part of a more 
 troubling pattern needing attention. 
 Shaun, the surgery was a success, right? 
 - Yes. 
 - The patient had a great outcome. 
 There is no pattern. 
 Goodbye.

 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You two are it. Room one. 
 When did the chest pain start? 
 I first noticed it Tuesday morning 
 along with shortness of breath. 
 [ASHER] Are you taking any medications? 
 I started with one, 
 then switched a few times. 
 These are used to treat ADHD. 
 And brain fog. 
 I'm a COVID long-hauler. 
 Um, and I just started 
 guanfacine and N-acetylcysteine, 
 which may actually be helping finally. 
 - When was your initial infection? 
 - Eight months ago. 
 It just felt like a mild flu, 
 but then it got worse, 
 like someone poured molasses 
 on my brain. 
 I've done cognitive therapy, 
 memory exercises, 
 still am, 
 whatever I can do 
 to get back in the field. 
 - Which one? 
 - Clover. 
 I'm an evolutionary biologist. 
 - Oh. 
 - Wow. 
 I have been studying how 
 white clover adapts 
 to environmental changes... 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
 And I'm on indefinite leave. 
 Please stop talking now. 
 Bluish skin, low O  levels,

 And increasingly labored breathing. 
 Possible pulmonary embolism. 
 Order a chest CTA and echo, stat. 
 I have to go. 
 [PRINTER WHIRRING] 
 Oh. 
 You will need this. 
 I sent one half of a high 
 volume order to your printer. 
 These are Glassman's op reports? 
 For the last three months. 
 January to March. 
 October to December is printing 
 in Park's and my office. 
 So you sent reports for, like, 
 surgeries to my printer? 
 No,     surgeries. 
 pages. 
 I've emailed Operations 
 to replace your toner. 
 Many elements are in color. 
 And why, exactly, 
 do you need all of this? 
 To find out if his mistake was a blip. 
 [PRINTER CONTINUES WHIRRING] 
 [OPENING THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Second time I've dislocated my knee. 
 Uh, first was a few months ago, I think. 
 - That was the sprained ankle. 
 - Ah. 
 The dislocation was last year. 
 Your MRI shows no associated 
 damage to bones or ligaments. 
 She's also been complaining 
 about dizziness, 
 swollen ankles, maybe menopause-related. 
 Dr. Reznick is looking to get her 
 on hormone replacement therapy. 
 Orion insisted I come in 
 and get everything checked out 
 before she leaves 
 and moves  ,    miles away 
 to live alone. 
 I'm moving to Prague 
 next week for a new job, 
 and you can come visit me 
 anytime you want, Mom. 
 [SCOFFS] Not with a busted knee. 
 To move forward with HRT, 
 I need to confirm all the medications 
 you've used over the last five years. 
 Oh, uh, there was a purple triangle one, 
 but they took me off that last year 
 and an orange-shaped one. 
 I'll review it with you. 
 We need to see how your knee is moving. 
 Lay back, please. 
 Go ahead with the exam, Dr. Kalu. 
 I thought I'd observe. 
 It's a knee exam, 
 not a multi-ligament reconstruction. 
 You told me last time not 
 to assume I know everything. 
 This is just making me do your job. 
 [SNORING] 
 [GASPING] 
 That sounded like an apneic spell. 
 Check her tonsils. 
 Ms. Garcia. 
 [SNORES] 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 Mm? 
 Oh, did I fall asleep again? 
 Yes. 
 Can I take a quick look in your mouth? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Kissing tonsils. 
 They're so enlarged, they're touching 
 and obstructing your airway, 
 causing severe apnea. 
 You need a tonsillectomy right away. 
 No pulmonary embolism, 
 but multiple cardiac issues. 
 Severe narrowing of the pulmonic valve, 
 hypertrophied right ventricle 
 and opening between the lower chambers. 
 This set of defects almost looks like 
 - tetralogy of Fallot, but... 
 - It is. 
 She has the fourth malformation, 
 overriding aorta. 
 I've never seen tet in an adult before. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 How is she still alive? 
 Hang on a sec. 
 I have to write everything down now. 
 [DR. LIM] Tet is almost always 
 diagnosed in infancy. 
 Doctors somehow missed it in your case. 
 [SHAUN] Oh, you have 
 a rare presentation. 
 The right ventricle obstruction 
 has been balanced 
 by an increased flow 
 into the left ventricle. 
 Damage from COVID disrupted the balance. 
 The virus may have saved your life. 
 Very few undiagnosed tet patients 
 survive past childhood. 
 A mere  % make it to   . 
 You're saying 
 I would have just dropped dead 
 at some point? 
 It's very likely. 
 We can remove that risk 
 with two separate procedures. 
 First, we'll close the extra vessels 
 that have formed to compensate 
 for your heart defects. 
 Then we'll do a surgery 
 to repair those defects. 
 Is it possible the tet is connected 
 to my long COVID symptoms? 
 Could fixing my heart clear up my head, 
 the brain? 
 No. I'm sorry. 
 [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You snagged our table. 
 Beat Hawks and Nunez to it. 
 You're a champion. 
 One Splenda, half Sugar in the Raw, 
 light almond milk. 
 Now who's the champion? 
 Mm. 
 I have something for you. 
 - Really? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 An agreement acknowledging 
 a consensual relationship. 
 I, Marcus Andrews, 
 would like to take you, 
 Dalisay Villanueva, on a date. 
 And as hospital president, 
 you know, I already signed it. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 This is so romantic. 
 Give me the pen. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 - Dinner this weekend? 
 - Let me see. 
 - [PHONE CHIMES] 
 - Oh, I'm needed on the ward. 
 Sorry. Lock it down later? 
 Sure. 
 Iced coffee? 
 I'm good. 
 How about a hot coffee? 
 In honor of Daphne's 
 successful tonsillectomy, 
 I got a few options. 
 Is that a latte? 
 Mm. 
 It was a routine tonsillectomy. 
 Those were unusually large tonsils. 
 A good thing her daughter 
 brought her in. 
 You think Daphne was 
 better off not breathing? 
 I don't think it's a daughter's job 
 to make sure Mom goes to the doctor. 
 [PHONES CHIME] 
 It's Daphne. 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Heart rate spiked. She's hypoxic. 
 Turn up oxygen to max flow. 
 Loud murmur from 
 the right ventricle and atrium. 
 Chronic damage from apnea 
 could have increased 
 the pressure in her lungs, 
 causing right heart failure. 
 - [MACHINE BEEPING] 
 - BP's dropping. 
 We need to get her to the cath lab. 
 [DR. LIM] Positioning coiling system. 
 [PEREZ] Two vessels left to close. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] 
 [DR. LIM] Deploying the coil. 
 O  sats are dropping. 
 Her infundibular muscle 
 is clamping down. 
 She is having a tet spell. 
 [MACHINE BEEPING URGENTLY] 
 Give phenylephrine and    % oxygen. 
 I have never seen one in-person before. 
 We need to move blood up to the lungs. 
 Give her a bolus and up the opiates. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 If we don't stop the spasm, 
 she could have permanent brain damage. 
 [BEEPING STOPS] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SHAUN] The chance of a future 
 infundibular spasm is very high. 
 Her tet repair surgery 
 will be much more risky. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Pressure in Daphne's lungs 
 is still critically high. 
 Not a routine tonsillectomy at all. 
 Puncturing the atrial septum. 
 [MACHINE BEEPING SOFTLY] 
 Right heart is decompressing. 
 Give nitric oxide to relax 
 and dilate the vasculature. 
 Her apnea really did a number 
 on her pulmonary vessels. 
 No wonder she's clumsy and forgetful. 
 She's been sleep- and 
 oxygen-deprived for decades. 
 It still doesn't make her 
 her daughter's responsibility. 
 Would you want Kellan to put 
 his life on hold to take care of you? 
 Not his whole life, no, 
 but I don't think being overly 
 devoted is the worst quality in a kid. 
 Remove the catheters. 
 I was one of six growing up, only girl. 
 Mom and dad worked a lot, 
 so I was basically 
 second mom since kindergarten. 
 I love my brothers, but... 
 there's a lot you miss out on 
 if you're all about taking care 
 of someone else. 
 [BEEPING CONTINUES] 
 She's throwing a lot of PVCs. 
 Maybe an electrolyte issue. 
 [MACHINE BEEPING URGENTLY] 
 BP's dropping. Heart rate    . 
 We're barely getting a pulse. 
 She's in V-tach. Defib pads. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DEFIBRILLATOR HUMS SHARPLY] 
 [DEFIBRILLATOR BEEPS, THUMPS] 
 [BEEPING STEADILY] 
 [SIGHS] 
 BP and heart rate stabilizing. 
 Get a new chemistry, chest X-ray, EKG. 
 We need to figure out what else 
 is going on with her heart. 
 Oh, please don't disturb my materials. 
 Which are what, exactly? 
 Dr. Glassman made an 
 uncharacteristic surgical error. 
 I am determining if it was an anomaly 
 or part of a pattern. 
 Glassman must be 
 really pleased about that. 
 He is not. 
 You are being sarcastic. 
 Performance review 
 is a standard practice 
 and benefits both doctors and patients. 
 I have identified three additional 
 errors 
 made in the last four months. 
 I don't see a pattern. 
 A dural tear on scarred tissue, 
 closing with a running nylon 
 instead of Monocryl... 
 Is that even a mistake? 
 Dr. Glassman has always used 
 subcutaneous Monocryl. 
 These are variations, minor missteps. 
 You pore through four months 
 of any surgeon's op reports, 
 and you'll find discrepancies like this. 
 - No. 
 - Yes. 
 Not in mine. 
 That's probably true. 
 Eh, if you're not finding a pattern, 
 maybe it's because there isn't one. 
 [PHONE BUZZES] 
 My patient is awake. 
 Does this mean you can't move 
 forward with the tet repair? 
 There's a medication called propranolol 
 that will significantly reduce the risk 
 of having another spasm during surgery, 
 but because of your long COVID, 
 you're at risk for some 
 very rare side effects. 
 - Are they serious? 
 - Yes. 
 Well, some of them are not, 
 like nausea, vomiting, 
 muscle aches, and dizziness, but others, 
 such as hypoglycemia 
 or visual changes... 
 We'll start you on the propranolol. 
 There's a good chance you won't 
 experience the rare side effects, 
 but we'll need to keep 
 a close eye on you. 
 And are those patients ahead of her 
 also seniors with diabetes? 
 Do not hang up on me, Phillip, 
 or I'll head down to do this in person. 
 I'll wait. 
 [WHISPERING] Hey. 
 There is a great new 
 Portuguese spot I read about. 
 I can make reservations for us 
 Friday or Saturday at  :  ? 
 Uh, I'm working a double both days. 
 It's been a nonstop scramble 
 since Baker and Linh left. 
 Well, you have two new 
 travelers starting on Monday. 
 We need staff nurses. 
 These nurses are highly skilled. We... 
 It doesn't matter how skilled 
 they are. 
 Travel nurses disrupt workflow, 
 don't build long-term relationships. 
 Right now, we just don't have the 
 resources 
 for permanent replacements. 
 You just hired a new 
 full-time surgical resident 
 to replace someone 
 who left way more recently. 
 That was Lim's department. I... 
 Yes, great. I'm sending her down. 
 Sorry. We'll talk later? 
 Of course. 
 So you're watching to see if I throw up? 
 Or faint, seize, or have muscle spasms. 
 You know, before COVID, my brain was... 
 I did evolutionary patterns, 
 genetic, uh... 
 how genes go together. 
 The sequence. 
 Now my brain can't handle the 
 sequence of brushing my teeth. 
 My focus, my working memory, 
 all of the... 
 [SIGHS] 
 The executive function. 
 [SIGHS] 
 It's not always happening. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Please page Dr. Wolke to 
 monitor her and stay until he comes. 
 Push your hand against mine. 
 The pattern is errors 
 in executive function. 
 Shaun, I'm in the middle 
 of doing something. 
 Your brain cancer may have returned. 
 All errors are tied 
 to executive function. 
 - Shaun... 
 - Specifically 
 to working 
 and procedural memory governed 
 by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 
 a common site for a recurrent glioma, 
 which strongly suggests 
 your cancer has returned. 
 My last scan came back 
 completely clear. I'm fine. 
 Your last scan was six months ago. 
 These errors all took place 
 in the last four months. 
 So you need another scan. 
 The evidence is very compelling. 
 No, it's really not. 
 I perform complex surgeries, Shaun, 
 more so than any other doctor 
 on this staff, by the way. 
 So yeah, the percentages would dictate 
 that I might make more minor 
 and irrelevant missteps, 
 if that's what you want 
 to call them, and... 
 And the rate of errors has increased. 
 Yeah, because I take on 
 the tougher cases, 
 the ones no one else will. 
 No, you need another MRI now. 
 Shaun, what I need 
 is to get back to my patient. 
 And you need to knock first next time. 
 [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It's the greening of the... 
 My turn. 
 I'm trying to get some 
 of my cognitive exercises in. 
 What are you memorizing? 
 It's a poem from 
 The Carrying, Ada Limon. 
 [DR. LIM] Hmm. 
 The collection is mostly about... 
 not having the life you 
 thought you'd have, I guess. 
 The one I was just reading, 
 it's about spring coming, 
 Instructions on Not Giving Up. 
 - Sounds useful. 
 - Yeah. 
 Too bad I can't read it all at once. 
 I've just graduated from haikus. 
 I never even thought to look 
 at a poem before I got sick. 
 Didn't have the patience 
 for it at the time, 
 but it's basically all I read now. 
 I started writing, too. 
 It's kind of a creative therapy. 
 [DR. LIM] Mm. 
 There was a kind of poetry 
 to the genetic variations 
 in white clover too. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I'd give anything to... 
 [SIGHS] 
 Your blood pressure is going down, 
 and your heart rate's climbing. 
 I feel kind of dizzy. 
 Let me check your glucose. 
 She's having a seizure. Crash cart now! 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [JARED] We thought something 
 else was going on with your heart, 
 but it's a kidney issue. 
 You have a narrowing 
 of your renal arteries, 
 which was exacerbated 
 by the pulmonary hypertension, 
 causing your kidneys to fail. 
 And this is because of my sleep apnea? 
 We believe so, yeah. 
 Uh, can she get a transplant? 
 I can do a test, see if I'm a match. 
 Unfortunately, your other health 
 concerns rule out a transplant, 
 but a renal artery bypass 
 would 
 allow your kidneys to heal on their own. 
 There's risk of complications, 
 some quite serious. 
 But in success, you could live 
 a full, independent life. 
 But... oh, but serious, 
 as in I could die? 
 Some complications can be fatal. 
 But the risk is relatively low. 
 Are there other options? 
 Well, there's dialysis, 
 but you'd need multiple sessions a week 
 for the rest of your life. 
 Um, that's less risky, but I... 
 I don't think I could handle 
 all that on my own. 
 Mom, Mom, if you want to choose 
 the dialysis, I'll stay in San Jose. 
 I'm sorry. 
 I don't want to keep you. 
 No, you have nothing to be sorry for. 
 All this time you've been sick 
 and struggling, and I... 
 I judged you. 
 But your new job. 
 It's just a job. 
 So the medication you gave me 
 to make my surgery safer 
 will actually make it more risky? 
 That's right. 
 But without that medication, 
 I'm much more likely 
 to have another tet spell. 
 Yes, and possibly more severe 
 than the last time. 
 The brain fog, all my deficits... 
 could get worse, 
 for possibly forever? 
 Yes. 
 [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 But if we don't do the tet repair, 
 your heart will stop at some point. 
 I've already been through 
 losing my thoughts, my whole self. 
 I can't do that again. 
 Find another way to fix my heart. 
 All right, new idea. 
 We go back to the old idea 
 and just do the surgery. 
 It's a non-starter. 
 We need to present a way to 
 help her tet without triggering her tet. 
 A percutaneous valve and VSD 
 closure could help with blood flow. 
 That involves catheters in the heart, 
 which would cause the muscle to spasm. 
 All right. It's time for some WWSMD. 
 Whatever you and Jerome do 
 on your own time is... 
 It's ""what would Shaun Murphy do?""

 maybe she lets us fix her heart. 
 Her tet will likely k*ll her

 Yeah, I had it catered. 
 You're the first to arrive. 
 And so far, last-minute rain checks 
 from Morgan, Park, Asher, Danny. 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 Oh, and Jerome. 
 So it's just us four? 
 Which means that all these snacks

 Oh. Yes. 
 The low turnout is the perfect

 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 In your recent surgeries 
 with Dr. Glassman, 
 do you recall observing 
 any balance issues, 
 tremors, or motor weakness? 
 That sounds like the perfect option. 
 How soon can you do the shunt procedure? 
 I'll try to schedule it for tomorrow. 
 I've had a strange year myself. 
 Eleven months ago, 
 I was att*cked 
 and paralyzed from the waist down. 
 I thought it was permanent. 
 Almost everyone did. 
 At first, all I wanted 
 was to walk again. 
 I was ready to risk my life 
 to get back to the old me. 
 But as time went on, 
 I started to appreciate 
 my new life, my new self. 
 [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I started a new relationship 
 that wouldn't have happened otherwise. 
 In many ways, my life improved. 
 You recognize you walked in 
 to tell me this story? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I only agreed to do the surgery 
 once I knew my life wasn't at risk. 
 And even then, I had doubts. 
 I liked who I'd become. 
 I wanted to hold on to her. 
 I'm not... 
 losing my mind... 
 all over again. 
 You don't strike me 
 as someone who's lost her mind. 
 [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] 
 That covers the thrombectomy. 
 In February, you assisted on a... 
 Okay, I'm playing

 Okay.

 I should head out, too.

 Maybe focus on being 
 a first-year resident 
 before adding party planner 
 to your resume. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 The catering may have been 
 a bridge too far. 
 Yeah. 
 I bounced around growing up. 
 Different schools, cities, countries. 
 But, um, wherever we were, 
 my parents had a big house, 
 and I knew how to throw a party. 
 Closest I'd get to feeling like I fit. 
 Old habits die hard, I guess. 
 Fitting in takes time. 
 But I never have, anywhere.

 Experts agree. 
 Yes, but that was brewed 
 when I woke up at  :   a.m. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You make it through the videos? 
 Yes, and integrated the observations 
 Doctors Kalu and Allen made last night 
 regarding possible glioma symptoms. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 I am now ready to present 
 Dr. Glassman with the revised evidence, 
 which is very compelling. 
 [LEA] Mm. 
 Thankfully, your infection is 
 responding to the antibiotics. 
 The infection started 
 around your dialysis port. 
 That could easily happen again. 
 The renal artery bypass 
 is still an option. 
 It's too risky. 
 So is sepsis. 
 Thank you, Doctor, 
 but I'll settle for being alive. 
 You shouldn't. 
 You deserve more than that. 
 I know you've had a whole life 
 of feeling sick 
 and stuck and repeating 
 the same old, bad patterns, 
 but your past does not have 
 to tell your future where to go. 
 You can choose a different path 
 and who you're gonna be on it. 
 [TENDER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 And let your daughter do the same. 
 Prague is beautiful in the spring. 
 [UPBEAT ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We've scheduled the shunt

 I've been waiting for the

 That person may not exist anymore. 
 And... 
 maybe I should be okay with that. 
 Do the tet repair. 
 [DR. PARK] Releasing the proximal clamp. 
 What made Daphne change her mind? 
 Dr. Allen has a way 
 of getting through to people. 
 Blood flow looks obstructed. 
 There's a kink in the graft. 
 We can undo it, but most likely, 
 it happens again. 
 [SOFT TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 We could anchor the bypass 
 off of the aorta instead. 
 At that angle, less chance of a kink. 
 Could work.

 You'll need to stay on top of your

 observe some dietary guidelines, 
 but the discharge plan lays it all out. 
 I'll be there to help, Mom. 
 No. 
 You won't.

 You need to live your own life. 
 But I... I will accept FaceTime calls. 
 And once I recover, 
 I'll come visit. 
 I hear that Prague 
 is beautiful in the spring. 
 [LAUGHS] 
 That sounds like a plan. 
 Mm, things not go well with Glassy? 
 He returned the files with a note saying 
 he did not look at them 
 and does not intend to. 
 I'm sorry. He probably... 
 It was a mistake to leave 
 them for him to read on his own. 
 Once I reorder the files, 
 I will go to 
 his office to review with him in person. 
 He made it pretty clear 
 he doesn't want to see them. 
 But he doesn't know 
 about the new evidence. 
 Maybe he doesn't want to know. 
 Cancer survivors have to 
 live with that uncertainty that... 
 Knowing is better than not knowing. 
 If he's not ready to look at this, 
 you can't force him. 
 Maybe he's scared, Shaun. 
 And I think maybe you're scared, too. 
 We're about to have a baby, 
 you're about to be a dad, 
 and I think you're worried about family, 
 and Glassman is a part of that. 
 But if you keep pushing, 
 you risk damaging 
 one of the most important 
 relationships in your life.

 That doesn't change

 On or off the clock, 
 I'm the same person. 
 To me, if you don't value 
 what the nurses do 
 enough to treat us 
 like a resource to invest in, 
 not a line item to be cut, 
 how much can you care about me? 
 And to be honest, 
 if that is your point of view... 
 it undercuts the respect I have for you.

 A big one. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Every major

 His body needs to divert

 We should amputate his lower half.

 - [DR. ANDREWS] It's barely hanging on. 
 [DR. LIM] But it is. 
 We're gonna try to save it.

 [BEEPING STEADIES] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] I think we should sack

 He has a physical job. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] If we end up amputating, 
 he's not gonna be working oil rigs.

 there's a critical... 
 [SHAUN] Narrowing of her aorta. 
 Her eye spacing is approximately 
 six millimeters wider 
 than the upper limit of normal. 
 She also has slightly low-set ears 
 and her hands are swollen. 
 She has Turner syndrome. 
 If we don't get that narrowing 
 fixed in the next few days, 
 she'll die. 
 It won't be easy to access, 
 but I need an angio 
 for a better view. 
 I'll locate the mother and get consent. 
 [BABY FUSSING] 
 Brady's pelvis is broken 
 and separated from the spinal column. 
 So to reattach his lower half, 
 we need to repair the pelvis, 
 plus all the damaged organs, 
 plus the major vascular injuries, 
 and then find a way 
 to ensure it all heals. 
 Are we even doing the 
 right thing by trying to fix this? 
 You want to give up 
 before we even start? 
 I've just never read anything 
 supporting reattaching 
 this kind of injury. 
 Could k*ll him. 
 Amputation is the safest thing to do. 
 Lim already knows about that option. 
 - Our job is to find a better one. 
 - No, our job... 
 Danny's right.

 [SIGHS] 
 They're optimistic she'll pull through. 
 Soon, let's hope. 
 We've got some big decisions 
 to make for her baby. 
 Her name's Jasmine West. 
 She's homeless and has bipolar disorder. 
 County records show the baby 
 was born seven weeks ago. 
 No dad in the picture, no other family. 
 And this was all she had on her 
 when EMS brought her in. 
 We need your consent 
 for the baby's diagnostic angiogram. 
 Sure. 
 The baby's Turner syndrome 
 makes every procedure, 
 even a diagnostic test, 
 a little riskier. 
 Well, this is your area of expertise. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Her baby's name is Eden. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Pretty close 
 to the upper lung bifurcation. 
 [DR. LIM] I reinforced it with sealant. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] With a synthetic wrap? 
 [DR. LIM] Are you 
 questioning my surgical skills? 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Are you getting defensive? 
 [MONITORS BEEPING STEADILY] 
 Okay. We're done. 
 Let's test it. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Good job.

 Cardiac function stable. 
 You're good to go. 
 Inserting the catheter. 
 What a cute little girl. 
 Little girls are cute. 
 - Mine would be really cute. 
 - Yeah, she'd be adorable. 
 A boy could be adorable too. 
 Are you trying to pick your embryo? 
 I'm leaning towards a girl. 
 I have a playbook to work from. 
 My playbook didn't help me much. 
 A lot of my issues with Kellan came 
 from me trying to stop him 
 from making the mistakes I made. 
 If I'd had a daughter, 
 maybe I wouldn't have 
 dumped all my baggage on her. 
 You should choose a girl. 
 But you're having a boy. 
 We didn't get to choose. 
 In all long-term health metrics, 
 females are more likely 
 to outperform males, 
 although they'll probably 
 make less money. 
 The narrowing is longer 
 than it measured on echo. 
 We should resect the narrowed segment 
 and do an aortic anastomosis. 
 Huge surgery for a baby. 
 It's the only definitive treatment. 
 Very definitive 
 if she dies on the table. 
 Balloon dilation is safer. 
 We can do a bigger procedure in a 
 few years when Eden can tolerate it. 
 Her heart failure could 
 relapse between surgeries. 
 Your two-step approach is safer, 
 but only if the baby gets 
 daily medication 
 and regular follow-up care. 
 That's a lot to ask of a homeless mom. 
 I'll page CPS and get consent. 
 You two practice the surgery. 
 A lot. 
 His pelvis looks like a jigsaw 
 puzzle with a     missing pieces. 
 Jared may be right. 
 You're taking his side. 
 I'm not taking anyone's side. 
 - Scans don't lie. 
 - Okay. 
 I'm not sure if you're mad at him or me, 
 but we all need to get along. 
 Well, you two seemed to be getting along 
 pretty well at the taco truck 
 the other night. 
 That was nothing. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're spying on me? 
 I was getting a taco. 
 This green-eyed monster thing 
 is not a good look for you. 
 I'm not jealous. 
 But you're right. 
 We're supposed to be a team. 
 He's just not a good fit. 
 Let's just focus on the patient. 
 Fine. 
 Can't see how we're gonna 
 repair all of that arterial damage. 
 What if we don't? 
 They could bypass it. 
 All of it. 
 This paper by Dr. Alice Chen features 
 interesting data on tumor 
 treating fields, for GBM tumors. 
 I'm trying to enjoy my tuna melt. 
 Dr. Chen is starting a new study soon. 
 You should call her. 
 I'm not gonna spend the day 
 chasing down cancer treatments 
 because I don't have cancer. 
 Okay, there is a higher 
 probability of cancer relapse 
 because you refused 
 maintenance chemotherapy. 
 I'm not gonna talk about this. 
 Recurrent GBM causes much 
 worse symptoms than temozolomide. 
 That's the decision I made. 
 I'm going crazy. 
 There are three crib sets I like. 
 I just can't decide. 
 Could you guys go to the store 
 after work tonight 
 and pick your fave? 
 Okay. 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 I have to go practice 
 the baby's surgery. 
 I will see you after work. 
 Oh, my God! 
 Should I be worried? 
 About me? No. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] We're going to k*ll him 
 trying to save the lobe of his lung. 
 Removing it still leaves him 
 with  / ths capacity. 
 [DR. LIM] When there's a chance 
 you might lose half your body, 
 everything you have left matters. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] I need 
 lobectomy instruments. 
 [DR. LIM] This is my OR, my department. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] My hospital. 
 And when a doctor's judgment 
 is compromised, 
 it's my responsibility to step 
 in and protect our patients. 
 [DR. LIM] In what possible way 
 am I compromised? 
 Are you implying that my time in a 
 wheelchair is affecting my objectivity? 
 [DR. ANDREWS] How could it not? 
 [DR. LIM] This is my patient. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] And I'm your boss. 
 You can either do this with me, 
 or I'll find someone who will. 
 [DR. LIM] Deaver retractor. 
 [JORDAN] After they fix 
 the colon, Lim can use 
 some preserved bowel 
 to create a new bladder 
 like these Korean surgeons did. 
 That would work perfectly 
 with what I found. 
 We can bypass all of the artery injuries 
 through two Dacron conduits 
 directly to his lower extremities. 
 And the improved blood flow 
 would help with my idea 
 with his pelvis. 
 So skin flaps, 
 Dacron artery bypass, neo-bladder, 
 bowel repair with biomaterials, and... 
 a badass, Wolverine-like 
 adamantium skeleton. 
 It's experimental, 
 but it's pretty damn cool. 
 Now, how do we make sure all this heals? 
 There's one study in Canada. 
 A cocktail of recumbent growth hormones 
 and pentoxifylline showed 
 a threefold increase 
 in traumatic wound healing rates. 
 That's great. 
 There's only four patients, 
 and none of them had 
 the same injuries as Brady. 
 So no one got cut in half 
 with a metal sheet on an oil rig? 
 Great, I guess we just 
 toss that study out. 
 I'm just saying, 
 I wish we had something better. 
 I'll happily take a threefold increase. 
 This is a workable plan. 
 Good, because Lim wants an update. 
 Some promising ideas, 
 but there's a lot 
 of frail tissue to heal. 
 I found a study using growth hormones 
 to accelerate the healing. 
 Interesting. Would that work here? 
 There was a threefold plan 
 that we had... 
 Well, hang on, I want to hear 
 from the guy who did the research. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I'm not confident it would. 
 You guys said you had a workable plan. 
 - It can work. 
 - Jared's being overly cautious. 
 If you close the pelvis 
 without good vascular support, 
 all these repairs will get necrotic. 
 We will have good support. 
 The 
 Dacron conduit to restore blood flow... 
 Not normal flow and not quick enough. 
 Oh, dude, you've been 
 doom and gloom from the start. 
 - I've been... 
 - Enough. 
 Find a way to heal him. 
 I don't care who it comes from, 
 but I need it soon. 
 The nurse said she's 
 responding to the medication. 
 How long will Eden be in 
 the hospital after the surgery? 
 Two weeks. 
 Jasmine's on the wait list 
 for long-term housing. 
 She might have a place by then. 
 Also, uh, 
 is this safe if she keeps breastfeeding? 
 The police found this in her tent. 
 This is a bipolar mood stabilizer. 
 It's safe. 
 How long has she been taking this? 
 She saw her psychiatrist 
 for the first time in years 
 about five weeks ago. 
 She responded to it in the past. 
 She had a follow-up 
 scheduled with him tomorrow. 
 There's another 
 treatment option for Eden. 
 I know, I know. It's disgusting. 
 You're gonna think, 
 ""What are the percentages?"" 
 Trust me, you change his diapers 
 and you are gonna bond with your son. 
 Okay, here is the Angelic Dream Set. 
 And be attentive to Lea. 
 Be extra attentive. 
 She's gonna be sleep-deprived. 
 You are gonna be sleep-deprived. 
 You're both gonna 
 want to lose it. Don't. 
 This mattress is very comfortable. 
 This dark wood is a little bit funereal. 
 The baby won't care about the color. 
 It's all about first impressions. 
 It's a newborn, you know? Clean slate. 
 You want to surround it 
 with beautiful things. 
 A stuffed, soft... No, 
 you don't want to do that. 
 That's a hazard. 
 But these spinny things... 
 what do you call these? 
 Mobiles, mobiles. 
 You know, everywhere he looks, 
 you want him to be interested, 
 stimulated. 
 Beautiful sounds. Beautiful music. 
 Mozart. Joni Mitchell. 
 If you want to talk about something 
 other than selecting a crib, 
 it should be brain cancer treatments. 
 Oh my God! 
 I don't want to think about that. 
 I can't not think about it. 
 In    hours, we will have results... 
 - Exactly. 
 - We should be prepared. 
 Okay, Shaun, stop. Just... 
 just stop for a second 
 Sit down. 
 Okay. 
 If I have cancer, 
 I'd be at stage four, right? 
 There's no miracle cure for that. 
 You still haven't called 
 Dr. Chen in Cleveland. 
 I read her paper. 
 It doesn't work with recurrent GBM. 
 How can you think about teddy 
 bears when you might be dying? 
 If you're right, Shaun, 
 then I won't be here 
 when your son is born. 
 I won't be here to help you. 
 We'll know when we know. 
 I like the lighter wood. 
 So do I. 
 What else should I know about diapers? 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Lung lobe is out. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] 
 These segmental vessels are damaged. 
 [DR. LIM] Running  -  sutures 
 should fix them. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Why bother? 
 The upper lobe is out. 
 [DR. LIM] If we can get 
 Perez's Dacron graft to work, 
 we could use them 
 to save his lower half. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Very unlikely. 
 [DR. LIM] The residents 
 are working on it. 
 [DR. 
 ANDREWS] And obviously not succeeding. 
 [DR. LIM] First, I'm compromised, 
 now you're slagging on the residents? 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Two are on probation, 
 you let another one go, 
 and her replacement is someone I fired. 
 [DR. LIM] He's also the world's 
 most experienced first-year, 
 and he brings a new perspective 
 to the mix. 
 And training these guys is my job. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Your job 
 is to make my job easier. 
 [DR. LIM] I thought it was to 
 run a great surgical department. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] If you were doing that, 
 I wouldn't have to think 
 about that department 
 as much as I have recently. 
 [DR. LIM] Vessel loops. 
 [DR. PARK] You changed 
 the baby's surgery? 
 We weren't giving Jasmine enough credit. 
 She's done a lot to turn her life around 
 since Eden was born. 
 For seven weeks. 
 And with this new treatment plan, 
 she has to keep it up for seven years. 
 A baby can change a person. 
 [INTERCOM BEEPS] 
 [ANNOUNCER ON INTERCOM] 
 Code pink, NICU bed three. 
 That's Eden. 
 Code pink, NICU bed three. 
 [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] 
 Lim asked for my opinion. 
 I met so many rich, entitled 
 guys like you in college, 
 and I couldn't stand them... 
 even the ones I slept with. 
 If you can't handle the hard work, 
 just get in your Lamborghini 
 and go home. 
 Sherry Lewis. 
 One of my last patients in Denver. 
 Late-stage ovarian cancer. 
 Treatment's pelvic exenteration. 
 You remove everything. 
 The bladder, colon, uterus, and vag*na. 
 Now, in success, 
 the patient lives with 
 colostomy and urostomy bags, 
 severe menopause, 
 and absolutely no sex life. 
 Well, it's brutal but effective. 
 Would have been. 
 But I talked my attending out of it, 
 in favor of an experimental surgery. 
 A wide excision of all the tumors, 
 then you reconstruct the entire 
 pelvic floor with TRAM flaps. 
 Incredibly advanced. 
 The type of stuff you're 
 talking about doing to Brady. 
 Sherry, um... 
 Sherry died on the table. 
 And I left Denver. 
 We take risks and people die. 
 But if we play it safe, 
 they die too. 
 I'd rather regret 
 fighting too hard for a patient 
 than not hard enough. 
 [SHAUN] Why would your 
 daughter shave your cat? 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Long story. 
 Point being, don't get a cat. 
 Kids are gonna tell you they're 
 gonna clean the litter box. 
 They're not gonna clean the litter box. 
 Don't fall for that trap. 
 You made a lot of mistakes. 
 Yeah. 
 It all boils down to 
 Maddy's mom basically raised her 
 while I focused on work. 
 You were a surgeon. 
 She was a real estate agent. 
 I love surgery. 
 I love poking around in people's brains. 
 It's very exciting. 
 And I get to save some lives 
 while I'm at it. 
 Saving lives is very exciting. 
 So were Maddy's first steps, 
 her first words, 
 her first piano recital, or so I heard. 
 Work over family, 
 and that's what you get. 
 You're not gonna make the same mistakes. 
 I don't think I will. 
 We are very different people. 
 Are we? 
 I have learned some 
 very useful things from you. 
 Well, right back at you. 
 [PHONE CHIMES] 
 The baby needs surgery. 
 The crib needs to be assembled. 
 Go. 
 But you chose work way too often. 
 When should I prioritize family? 
 [CHUCKLES] When you have a sick baby 
 and a piece of furniture, 
 the sick baby wins every time. Go. 
 I got this. 
 [PEREZ] Serial debridement. 
 Helps healing a little, but... 
 it increases infection risk a lot. 
 Well, then I'm tapped out. 
 Me too. 
 I guess we should tell Lim. 
 Lamborghinis. 
 [BREATHING HEAVILY] 
 Lamborghinis. 
 Now, most sports cars use 
 pressurized combustion 
 to achieve that kind of performance, 
 but not Lambos. 
 No, no, no, no. 
 To reduce engine wear, they use vacuums 
 to pour gas into the pistons. 
 Now, Brady's organs won't heal 
 because we can't get 
 enough flow to them, 
 but if you force more blood 
 into the area, well, 
 then we cause lethally high 
 abdominal compartment pressure. So... 
 Let's pull in the blood 
 passively by creating a vacuum 
 using internal suction devices. 
 A low pressure system with low 
 tissue stress is better for healing. 
 [ASHER] That's... 
 That's a brilliant idea. 
 But it won't work. 
 Not without blood 
 coming into the right areas. 
 I need your help with that. 
 Where do you need the blood? 
 It's what we proposed earlier, 
 plus a healing plan that Jared... 
 [DR. ANDREWS] I can read. 
 [DR. LIM] Good work. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] It's four 
 experimental techniques 
 rolled into an eight-hour surgery 
 with lousy odds of success. 
 Let's give it a try. 
 [DR. LIM] Dacron conduits 
 are connected to the aorta. 
 Do the anastomosis sites 
 look secure enough? 
 Any weak spots in there 
 will move that metal. 
 He'll bleed out. 
 They know. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] On three. 
 One, two, three. 
 [DR. LIM] We have hemostasis. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] And good 
 blood flow through the conduits. 
 Tissue's perfusing. 
 [BOTH LAUGHING] 
 Yes! Yes! 
 [MUFFLED CHATTER] 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Time to move on 
 to the pelvic fractures. 
 This is much more important 
 than assembling a crib. 
 But patients will always need surgery, 
 and my family will 
 always need attention. 
 If there's no clear choice 
 between a patient 
 and your family, pick the one 
 that's related to you. 
 Hmm. 
 Obviously, choose family when you can, 
 but sacrifice is part of the job. 
 That's a good point. 
 But you are divorced. 
 That is more sacrifice than I want. 
 Fair. 
 [MONITOR BEEPS] 
 [DR. REZNICK] Eden's O  sat 
 just dropped a bit. 
 I'm nowhere near her lungs. 
 Turner syndrome causes leaky vessels. 
 The stress on Eden's body is 
 causing lymph fluid to build up. 
 We can drain it with a chest tube. 
 Her chest is so small, you'd risk a 
 collapsed lung 
 and pleural infection. 
 I could clear the lung with diuretics. 
 The risks and benefits of both 
 treatments are nearly identical. 
 But that also means it doesn't 
 matter which one we choose, 
 which makes the choice easy. 
 I find inserting chest tubes 
 particularly satisfying, 
 so I will do that. 
 The risks and benefits of a boy 
 and a girl are nearly identical too. 
 But girls kick ass. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] This implant's gonna 
 be a tight fit 
 around the cauda equina. 
 The bioengineer's mapping algorithm 
 was designed to optimize stability. 
 [DR. LIM] Well, 
 Brady's not an algorithm. 
 His nerves are gonna run where they run. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] I'll set it in position. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Nerve impingement. 
 [DR. LIM] I'll expand 
 the narrowing with a rod. 
 Wait, there's an alternate 
 algorithm that can fix that. 
 [DR. LIM] Settle down, 
 Dr. Allen. I got this. 
 That's $   ,    worth of tech, 
 and she's using a rod. 
 [BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Nerve activity flattening. 
 [DR. LIM] One more minute. 
 [BEEPING STEADIES] 
 [BREATHES DEEPLY] 
 [DR. ANDREWS] The old 
 cantilever maneuver. 
 Nice work. 
 [DR. LIM] Can't beat the classics. 
 Eden's surgery went well, 
 so I was hoping Jasmine might... 
 V-fib. 
 Ran a code for an hour, but... 
 she'd just been through too much. 
 [DR. LIM] Vacuum devices 
 are in position. 
 Let's see if they work. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Keep a close eye 
 on his intra-abdominal pressure. 
 [DR. LIM] We have vacuum. 
 [VILLANUEVA] IA pressure's okay. 
 [DR. LIM] Time for the tissue flaps. 
 Looking good, Lambo. 
 [VILLANUEVA] There's 
 a small spike in IA pressure. 
 - [BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 - [DR. LIM] Increasing vacuum suction. 
 [VILLANUEVA] Still climbing. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Pressure's 
 compressing his organs. 
 [BEEPING RAPIDLY] 
 He's getting ischemic. 
 [DR. LIM] I'm going up to   . 
 He's in shock. 
 I did this. 
 You didn't do anything. 
 We're in this together. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] We need to amputate. 
 [DR. LIM] Not yet. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Audrey, pressure's 
 too high. We're k*lling his organs. 
 I think he's wrong. 
 Then fight for your patient. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] We need to amputate. 
 - [DR. LIM] Okay. 
 - [DR. ANDREWS] All right. 
 We need a Liston amputation knife, 
 a bone saw, and a set 
 of    / -inch hemostats. 
 He can handle   . 
 [DR. ANDREWS] With that kind 
 of pressure, he'll bleed out. 
 Normally, yes. 
 But the Dacron conduits Dr. Perez chose 
 are more rigid than typical vessels. 
 They'll hold up. 
 [DR. LIM] Let's do it. 
 I trust my residents, Marcus, 
 and I need you to trust me. 
 [DR. ANDREWS] Let's go to   . 
 Brady's family are here. 
 Is my husband... 
 The surgery was a success. 
 It will be a long recovery, but... 
 Oh. 
 Thank you for saving my dad. 
 I'll take you to him. 
 I should be dead on my feet, 
 but I just feel... 
 - Awesome? 
 - Yeah. 
 It's been    hours. 
 Yeah. 
 [SIGHS] I just need a minute. 
 A minute won't change the results. 
 No, it won't. 
 No cancerous DNA detected. 
 I was wrong! 
 Yes, you were.

 Shaun just wanted to have 
 a bit of a discussion... 
 You forgot two screws 
 when you built the crib. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay, Shaun, slow down. 
 Let's all at least take a seat first. 
 We're gonna have a discussion 
 about a crib? 
 Your CSF DNA test showed 
 your brain cancer has not returned, 
 but there is clearly something 
 impacting your neurological function. 
 Shaun, the crib has like 
 different parts 
 and instructions without any words. 
 Just pictures with arrows going 
 in every possible direction. 
 Okay. Thankfully, I was there 
 to correct your mistake, 
 but that won't always 
 be possible in the O.R. 
 The O.R.? 
 Yes. 
 - I would like to do more tests. 
 - That's not gonna happen. 
 - That's not gonna happen. 
 - And... And Dr. Lim should be notified. 
 That's absolutely not gonna happen! 
 If your executive function 
 has deteriorated 
 - even a small percentage... 
 - Shaun, just one second. 
 Just stop for a second. 
 Two screws? 
 There's nothing wrong with my brain. 
 There's nothing wrong 
 with any part of my body, 
 for that matter, 
 not that that concerns you. 
 You go to Lim, and you're 
 gonna look ridiculous. 
 - Doctor... 
 - That's the end of the discussion! 
 And breakfast. 
 He's right. 
 It's okay. You were just trying... 
 I can't go to Dr. Lim 
 without conclusive medical evidence. 
 Or maybe he was right. 
 It is just a crib, and he was in a rush. 
 Everyone forgets things. 
 I-I forgot the blueberries. 
 Instead of tests, 
 I can gather data 
 through direct observation. 
 What does that mean? 
 Are you gonna spy on him? 
 Please put my pancakes in the fridge. 
 I will eat them for dinner. 
 Good morning. 
 Mind if I join you? 
 Sure. 
 How are things in surgical? 
 - Great. 
 - Great, as in, actually great? 
 Or great, as in, 
 ""I'm saying the right thing 
 because he's the president 
 of the hospital""? 
 Both. 
 Well, any feedback you have, 
 you can always come to me. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 I have a clinic patient 
 who needs a surgical consult. 
 It's a former patient of yours, 
 Eddie Richter. 
 Eddie? 
 I haven't seen him in years. 
 He came in with GI pain and acid reflux. 
 Ultrasound reveals a small mass 
 on his duodenum. 
 He'll need surgery to remove it. 
 I think I can fit that in. Join me. 
 Dr. Lim scheduled us 
 with Dr. Park today. 
 Doctors Park and Lim will understand. 
 This is a unique case. 
 A small duodenal mass? 
 I don't know. 
 Eddie! 
 Long time no see. 
 I wish it were longer. No offense. 
 I wasn't planning on 
 seeing a surgeon today. 
 Yeah, yeah, fair enough. 
 I've brought along with me 
 Doctors Allen and Wolke to assist. 
 - Hi. 
 - Nice to meet you. 
 Judging by the astonishment 
 they are both 
 desperately trying to hide, 
 you did not tell them 
 about my condition. 
 I did not. Very few residents get to see 
 Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis 
 outside of a textbook, 
 and I figured this would be an 
 important learning opportunity. 
 They definitely failed 
 the bedside manner part. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Eh, heartthrobs like me 
 and Brad Pitt are used to it. 
 Any deep pain or tenderness here? 
 A little. 
 How's business? 
 Oh, fantastic. Thank the Lord. 
 Eddie is an amazing carpenter. 
 He built Isabel and I 
 this stunning mahogany 
 live edge dining table. 
 I have no idea what that is, 
 but it sounds delightful. 
 Yeah. Not much good for guitar, 
 but I can still wield a power tool. 
 You'll need to use 
 a carotid pulse monitor 
 and upper thigh for BP. 
 Got it. 
 How painful are the growths? 
 I mean, that depends. 
 They're basically just huge warts, 
 so face, not much. 
 Hands, a little. 
 Feet, a lot. 
 I'm blessed. 
 The Lord knows that a pretty face 
 can only get a handyman in trouble. 
 Dr. Reznick gave us a really 
 good view with her ultrasound, 
 but I'd like an MRI and a 
 biopsy to better assess the lesion. 
 Ah, might as well get 
 my money's worth, huh? 
 It's good seeing you, Eddie. 
 The team doc's playing it safe. 
 It was a damn curveball. 
 Well, even a damn double-A curveball 
 comes in at, what,   ,   ? 
 It can still do some damage, 
 helmet or no. 
 Two weeks isn't a long time 
 to be in concussion protocol. 
 Okay, well, I-I didn't 
 have a concussion. 
 I mean, I barely even had 
 a headache, so... 
 Can I help you, Dr. Murphy? 
 I came to observe. Please continue. 
 Your ImPACT scores 
 are a bit worse than baseline. 
 Okay, that's one test. 
 I mean, I-I passed all the others, 
 but the doc still won't clear me. 
 It's not a bad idea 
 to play it safe, though. 
 It is your brain we're talking about. 
 I mean, you're an outfielder, 
 so you don't need one just now... 
 ...but you are gonna retire someday. 
 Look, if I don't get back 
 on the field ASAP, 
 I won't have a career to retire from. 
 I wouldn't have come to the best 
 brain doctor in town otherwise. 
 Alright. We'll take a look. 
 Do a neuro and get me an MRI. 
 An MRI? For a concussion? 
 Well, he's got some dilation 
 of his left pupil. 
 Probably not significant, 
 but if we're gonna override 
 the team doctor, 
 we better be sure, hmm? 
 - On it. 
 - The MRI is a good idea. 
 I did not notice the dilated pupil. 
 Well, thank you. 
 Not a problem since it's not your case. 
 But it is an interesting case, 
 even if I did not know that 
 when I came here. 
 Since I've cleared my schedule, 
 I would like to continue observing. 
 You cleared your schedule 
 of people with actual ailments? 
 Mmm. 
 Okay, fine. Observe all you want. 
 I will. 
 Both you and the case. 
 Oh, there's no bleeding 
 or hematoma in your groin, 
 which means you're doing fantastic. 
 Her color looks better. 
 Everything looks better. 
 I just got off the phone 
 with Eden's social worker. 
 She's having trouble 
 finding foster parents 
 who are willing to take 
 a newborn with Turner Syndrome. 
 Well, it's not that difficult. 
 Her long-term symptoms 
 might not even be that severe. 
 Still, Eden will always 
 need special care. 
 It'll take a minute for 
 the lidocaine to take effect. 
 You may feel some discomfort 
 when the scope goes down your throat. 
 Got it. 
 I assume you've discussed 
 surgical removal 
 of your EV growths with Dr. Andrews? 
 Yeah. No, he wanted to try, 
 but obviously, there's the risk 
 of nerve damage, 
 plus they would just grow back. 
 This is how I was meant to be. 
 Lord works in mysterious ways. 
 But surgeons don't. 
 The risk of nerve damage 
 is actually quite small, 
 and I'd imagine easier 
 to live with than the pain 
 and lack of mobility and... 
 Repulsiveness? 
 No, no. I-I was... 
 It's alright. 
 I know how I look. 
 I see the frightened kids, 
 people laughing, 
 staring. 
 I just try my best to keep 
 my eyes and arms open 
 to all of God's gifts. 
 Cannot imagine taking an 
 -mile-an-hour baseball to the dome. 
 Some guys in the majors throw over    . 
 Phew. 
 I don't see any edema 
 or evidence of a hematoma. 
 Neither do I. 
 The anisocoria's probably harmless. 
 Twenty percent of people actually 
 have one pupil larger than the other. 
 You play any sports? 
 I played football and baseball 
 in high school. Why? 
 I have a friend who runs a 
 sports program for at-risk teens. 
 I've been helping coaching 
 some indoor football, 
 I mean soccer. 
 She's always looking for help 
 from positive role models. 
 Yeah, I've... 
 I've never coached kids before. 
 Mainly just making sure they 
 have fun and stay off the streets. 
 And my friend's super cool. 
 She's cute, too. 
 Well, helping kids sounds great, 
 but I'm trying to get a year in recovery 
 before I start dating. 
 Damn, my bad. 
 Oh, it's no big deal. I just... 
 No, I mean the... The anisocoria. 
 Definitely not harmless. 
 Or a concussion. 
 You have multiple cerebral aneurysms, 
 which puts you in danger 
 of a brain hemorrhage. 
 So, what now? 
 Well, we're gonna map 
 the precise vessels involved, 
 take some pictures 
 of the inside of your brain. 
 It's called a... 
 Cerebral angiogram. 
 We'll feed a catheter into your brain 
 through an artery in your wrist. 
 You'll be sedated. It's harmless. 
 As soon as we get the results, 
 we'll map out a surgical plan. 
 B-Brain surgery? 
 Hey. Best brain doc in town, right? 
 It just keeps getting worse. 
 The tumor has significantly 
 damaged the bile duct. 
 Eddie's gonna need a surgical resection 
 or possibly a major GI reconstruction. 
 The poor guy. 
 As if one rare and devastating 
 disease wasn't enough. 
 Well, the surgery is manageable. 
 I've known Eddie for years. 
 He's always been the embodiment 
 of, ""What doesn't k*ll you 
 makes you stronger."" 
 Who needs strength 
 when you're cradled 
 in the Lord's loving arms? 
 Given his situation, 
 don't you think his, 
 ""I'm just thankful for all God's 
 gifts"" attitude's just a bit crazy? 
 I find the strength he draws 
 from his faith very inspiring. 
 Except that his faith has inspired him 
 to not do the only thing 
 that would actually help him. 
 Get an octreoscan to confirm 
 that his liver, pancreas, 
 and lymph nodes aren't involved. 
 On it. 
 - You should probably go and... 
 - Referee? 
 Assist. 
 The radiolabeled tracer 
 will light up any areas 
 infiltrated by the tumor. 
 Will I get spidey strength, too? 
 Can I get you flat 
 on your back for the scan? 
 That won't be too painful, will it? 
 No. Sure, I'll be alright. 
 Is there any family 
 you'd like to contact? 
 No, it's just me. I live alone. 
 If you don't mind my asking, 
 E.V. is genetically inherited. 
 I'd assume at least one of 
 your parents suffered from it? 
 Yeah, they both did. 
 Did they both also decide 
 against surgical treatment? 
 Well, my parents were circus performers, 
 made a living off their appearance, 
 so I doubt they wanted any treatment. 
 Can't say that for sure, though. 
 They gave me up, 
 uh, right after I was born. 
 I'm sure they were trying to 
 protect you from the life they had. 
 Heh. No, from what I found out, 
 they thought a family act 
 would be too sad 
 and ruin the gig, 
 so they didn't want me around. 
 That's horrible. 
 Not at all. 
 I grew up in foster homes. 
 I had one mom who was a minister, 
 introduced me to the power of the Lord. 
 And then, when I was older, 
 I had a dad who was a carpenter. 
 Taught me everything I know. 
 I've always been blessed. 
 Advancing the catheter to 
 assess posterior circulation. 
 Dr. Murphy, do you mind if I ask, 
 qhy are you observing us? 
 I don't mind. 
 Why are you observing us? 
 I am not observing you. 
 I observing this case 
 because it is interesting. 
 Also, because it is Dr. Glassman's, 
 and he may display additional symptoms 
 that will help me diagnose 
 his deteriorating executive function. 
 So you're worried because he forgot 
 a couple of stitches on a routine close? 
 Stop. 
 The third aneurysm is low lying 
 at the basilar trunk. 
 That will be very difficult to clip. 
 And dangerous. 
 Definitely a very interesting case. 
 You sure you should be doing that? 
 Changing bandages or singing? 
 Both. 
 She's gonna be leaving soon. 
 I'll be fine. 
 No, I'm not overreacting. 
 He is covered in these tree-like 
 growths but refuses surgery. 
 But everyone acts 
 as if he's so inspiring. 
 It's a pretty brave choice. 
 No, it's a stupid choice. 
 Living in isolation 
 and unnecessary pain, 
 all because of his belief 
 in the Magical Mystery Tour 
 that is religion. 
 Well, given your family history, 
 I see why this patient is 
 a little triggering for you. 
 Okay, I'm not triggered. 
 This has nothing to do with my family. 
 Religion is the opiate of the masses. 
 You know, Marx got a lot wrong, 
 but not that one. 
 Why don't we talk about something else? 
 I mean, look at terrorism, 
 the countless wars, 
 the KKK, al-Qaeda, 
 bombed abortion clinics, 
 the as*ault on women's rights, 
 not to mention 
 the rampant persecution 
 of the LGBTQIA community. 
 I mean, you either have to have 
 your head in the sand 
 or be a complete moron not to see that. 
 Mmm. 
 This is done. Will you grab the salad? 
 Sorry. I was looking 
 for a place to meditate. 
 It's okay. 
 I came here to decompress 
 before I head home. 
 Jordan. 
 The other night at karaoke, 
 I shouldn't have tried to 
 give you relationship advice. 
 I mean, you don't need me for that... 
 or anything else, really. 
 You're everything. 
 Thanks. 
 Sorry, I gotta go. 
 He started vomiting blood 
 and then lost consciousness. 
 Get two units PRBC, stay two ahead, 
 - and place an NG tube. 
 - On it. 
 Eddie, can you hear me? Eddie? 
 The tumor's caused 
 a severe duodenal ulcer 
 and major hemorrhaging 
 in his upper GI tract. 
 Yeah. We can't excise it 
 if we can't stop the bleed. 
 We could do it in two steps, 
 endoscopy to stop the bleed 
 and a partial duodenectomy 
 to remove the tumor. 
 But it'd be safer to debulk 
 the tumor after the scope 
 and follow up with 
 aggressive chemotherapy. 
 Chemo would increase the pace 
 of the E.V. growths. 
 Which he doesn't seem bothered by. 
 Doesn't mean we should make it worse. 
 Well, it's better than 
 bleeding out in the OR. 
 He's not going to bleed out. 
 We can solve both the GI bleed 
 and totally excise the tumor 
 with a pancreaticoduodenectomy. 
 A Whipple while the patient 
 is hemorrhaging? 
 That's even more risky 
 than combining the scope and... 
 I'm aware of that, 
 but unlike your department chief, 
 I'm not interested in whether residents 
 approve of my decisions. 
 Get him prepped. 
 We'll approach all three aneurysms 
 from a left-sided craniotomy. 
 Even though the ICA aneurysm 
 is on the right side? 
 Yes. 
 We'll go after the basilar first, 
 as that is the most challenging. 
 What about the ipsilateral PCOM? 
 It's pressing the third nerve 
 and may rupture soon. 
 If you'd let me finish, 
 step two will be the PCOM, 
 and after that, 
 we'll cut across the infield 
 and go after the ICA. 
 Have you considered... 
 Shaun, will you stop? 
 Will you just please stop? 
 I'm fine. I know what I'm doing. 
 My memory is intact. 
 Does anyone have an actual objection 
 to the surgical plan? 
 - No. 
 - Nope. 
 Thank you. It is extensive 
 and could put Ricky at risk 
 for future seizures. 
 And your outburst could 
 indicate a lack of impulse control, 
 which is a symptom 
 of executive dysfunction. 
 I am exhibiting extraordinary 
 impulse control as we speak. 
 As to the risks, 
 I have clipped over  ,    aneurysms. 
 Tomorrow morning, 
 I'm going to clip three more. 
 Put Ricky on the schedule. 
 Go home. Get some sleep. 
 It's not milk and cookies, 
 but it'll have to do for now. 
 Oh, sorry. 
 I was gonna take care of that. 
 Why? Did Park tell you to? 
 Dr. Park? No. I just got off my break, 
 - and I was going to... 
 - Great news. 
 I just got off the phone 
 with her social worker. 
 She found a foster family. 
 Lucky girl. You've got a home. 
 I know you were hoping 
 for a pancake dinner, 
 but I was thinking maybe we 
 could go to Barone's instead. 
 I'm really craving a meatball. 
 Yes, Dr. Glassman is not only 
 highly experienced. 
 He has above average intelligence. 
 I don't know. He is an A's fan. 
 I have not noticed any symptoms 
 significant enough to alert Dr. Lim, 
 but even with a decline 
 in executive function, 
 he might not show serious deficits. 
 I think we should definitely 
 discuss it further, 
 over sauteed artichokes. 
 I am not hungry, 
 but I will come and keep you company 
 while I continue to work. 
 If Glassy can still do brain surgery 
 and you haven't seen 
 any serious deficits... 
 There is definitely something 
 wrong with his brain. 
 He's getting older. 
 It happens to everyone. 
 This is not just aging. 
 I know Dr. Glassman. 
 Do you think Glassman 
 is a danger to his patients? 
 No. 
 Not yet. 
 Then let's go to Barone's 
 and eat some meatballs 
 and chicken wings that I will 
 enjoy for a few glorious hours 
 until the indigestion kicks in. 
 You are right. 
 Meatball, stat. 
 That's the last 
 anastomosis. Remove the clamp. 
 Looks like the sutures are holding. 
 I can't believe we did 
 a Whipple in under six hours. 
 That's gotta be a record. 
 More importantly, no more tumor, 
 no more bleeding ulcer. 
 Went even better than I'd hoped. 
 Gotta give the good Lord his due. 
 Eddie is truly blessed. 
 We need a few more 
 -  prolenes on a Castro 
 and two surgical drains. 
 Hey. You got your gear for tonight? 
 Yep. 
 Dug out the old football cleats. 
 Awesome. 
 Samira's really looking forward 
 to meeting you. 
 Don't worry. I respect your recovery. 
 - I'm not trying to set you up. 
 - Thank you. 
 Jordan also told me she'd k*ll me 
 if I did anything 
 to tempt you off your path. 
 You and Dr. Allen were talking about me? 
 Yeah. She was just making sure I 
 knew what you were dealing with. 
 She's definitely looking out for you. 
 My head. It's gonna explode. 
 He has a thunderclap headache 
 and double vision. 
 His left eyelid's droopy, 
 looks like complete third nerve palsy. 
 Left pupil non-reactive to light. 
 The PCOM aneurysm must have ruptured. 
 We need to get him to the OR, stat. 
 Page Dr. Glassman. 
 Scalpel. 
 Intracranial pressure is dropping. 
 We've bought him some temporary relief. 
 Can we see the CT scans, 
 the new ones, please? 
 Given the subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
 the risk of the previous 
 surgical plan has increased. 
 I can still clip 
 the two smaller aneurysms, 
 then ligate and bypass the ruptured one. 
 We should consider coil embolization 
 of the ruptured aneurysm. 
 We treat that now and then 
 come back for the other two 
 once Ricky has recovered. 
 Then he has to come in every 
 six months for an angiogram, 
 weakening his muscles, 
 damaging his coordination, 
 effectively ending his pro career. 
 That's your recommendation? 
 The treatment is a much safer option. 
 He's   . 
 He has lots of life 
 to consider after baseball. 
 I'm confident in what I promised. 
 I'm confident that I can deliver it. 
 Your experience mitigates 
 the increased risks 
 of the craniotomy, 
 but it does not eliminate them. 
 The patient should decide. 
 Fine. 
 Let's wake him up 
 and present both plans. 
 The surgery went better 
 than we could have hoped. 
 We removed the tumor, 
 and your liver and pancreas 
 are working great. 
 So when do I get to go home? 
 Well, we need to keep an eye 
 on you for a couple days. 
 I took the liberty of 
 getting you a few things 
 to help pass the time. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm so grateful to you all. 
 I've spent so much time on my own, 
 I can forget how wonderful it is 
 to have other people there 
 who care about you. 
 Hey. Sorry. I got 
 a little aggro last night. 
 My family was big on dinner debate time. 
 Okay. 
 That's all you have to say? 
 I have a blood draw to do, so... 
 It was just a philosophical discussion. 
 It's not like we got 
 into a fight, right? 
 No, we didn't. 
 - It was awful. 
 - Terrible. 
 Somebody's in a good mood. 
 Indeed I am. 
 It's the Eddie effect. 
 Our patient radiates positivity. 
 It's oddly contagious. 
 It's got me wondering 
 why I'm always so focused 
 on choosing the right path instead of... 
 just being open to God's gifts. 
 Sorry. 
 My gift is using my stomach 
 as a speedbag. 
 I don't know what's worse... 
 that I might not walk out of here, 
 or walking out knowing that 
 I'll never play ball again. 
 Yes. That is the question 
 you need to answer. 
 Don't get stuck on worst-case scenarios. 
 I worked real hard to get here, 
 you know? 
 And I... And I got 
 people counting on me... 
 Hey, hey, hey. 
 Shut out the noise. 
 Other people are gonna have opinions, 
 whether you swing  - , 
 whether you don't take the extra base. 
 Whatever decision you make, 
 that's gonna be the right decision. 
 You know, uh, there's a... 
 There's a saying 
 back in the DR... 
 ""You can't walk off the island."" 
 You gotta take big swings. 
 Let's fix all the aneurysms now. 
 Good call. 
 You'll need to keep 
 the wound site clean and dry. 
 And be sure to monitor 
 her caloric intake closely. 
 Babies with Turner Syndrome 
 have difficulty swallowing 
 and tongue dysfunction. 
 Turner Syndrome? 
 Will she need additional surgeries? 
 Yes, but not for a few years. 
 With things like this, 
 it's best to take it one step at a time. 
 We were hoping to foster to adopt. 
 And these long-term medical issues... 
 they're significant. 
 When it comes to medicine, 
 Google is not your friend. 
 Patrick, Annie, 
 I know it all sounds scary, 
 and you have every right to be nervous. 
 But you can do this. 
 Eden needs you. 
 Wouldn't it be best for Eden 
 if you found someone more qualified? 
 I'll let Social Services know. 
 What's the score? 
 How am I doing? My executive function. 
 What's the score? 
 It is not a score, it is data, 
 and I am not ready 
 to draw my conclusions. 
 Well, you're wasting your time. 
 You should focus on people 
 who actually need you. 
 I'm fine. 
 I am focused on you... 
 because for most of my life, 
 you've watched out for me. 
 No one asked you to do it. 
 You chose to. 
 Sometimes when I didn't want you to. 
 I'm very glad you did. 
 So no matter what anyone, 
 including you, says, 
 I am going to watch out for you. 
 What are you talking about? 
 It's fantastic. 
 These are incredible, seriously. 
 I didn't mean to interrupt. 
 No, Dalisay was just showing me 
 her watercolor landscapes. 
 She's a wonderful painter. 
 Really? I had no idea. 
 There's increased output 
 in his J.P. drains. 
 That's not surprising, 
 considering your EV. 
 Send a sample to the lab 
 and add meropenem 
 to his antibiotic regimen, 
 just to be safe. 
 Your recovery looks to be on track. 
 And we've made significant advances 
 in plastic surgery techniques 
 since your last consult. 
 Yeah, I don't doubt it. 
 But we both know 
 it would still be painful, 
 and they'd just grow back anyway. 
 There's one thing I've learned 
 from the home reno business, 
 ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" 
 A proverb for the ages. 
 I wanted to say goodbye. 
 The foster parents backed out. 
 She's scrambling to find someone else. 
 I don't have another family lined up. 
 Can you give me more time? 
 N-No. 
 Eden needs a home, and I know 
 the perfect person to foster her. 
 Me. 
 One down, two to go. 
 It's been five hours. 
 Do you need a break? 
 Not when I have a   -year-old Macallan 
 waiting for me at the finish line. 
 Fenestrated aneurysm clip. 
 We've got an intra-op rupture. 
 Bleed is massive. 
 Suction. Both of you, suction. 
 Let's keep this field clear. 
 Should we try balloon occlusion? 
 - Or a flow diverting stent? 
 - No. 
 We should adjust the clips 
 to get better proximal 
 and distal control 
 and pivot to a Muslin wrapping. 
 Push   mg bolus adenosine. 
 We're gonna stop the heart. 
 Push it, please. Push it. 
 Aneurysm clips. 
 Oh. That is very innovative. 
 Inducing a brief cardiac arrest 
 reduces blood flow to the aneurysm. 
 Gives us time to apply the clips. 
 Okay. Let us proceed with 
 the parent vessel reconstruction. 
 One more time, 
 fenestrated aneurysm clip. 
 Thank you. 
 That was exciting. 
 He's in Vfib, 
 not responding to chest 
 compressions or epi... 
 We need to shock him. Charge to    , 
 and push another milligram of epi. 
 He must have thrown a clot. 
 Clear! 
 Time of death,  :  . 
 His underlying illness 
 weakened his immune system 
 and made his blood 
 more susceptible to clots. 
 There's nothing we could have done. 
 Do you know what hospital you're in? 
 St. Bonaventure. 
 And why are you here? 
 Aneurysms, which you were 
 supposed to fix. 
 Which we did. And we did quite well. 
 In fact, if you stick to your rehab, 
 you might be back 
 on the field by mid-season. 
 Thank you, Dr. Glassman. 
 You got a surgery that can 
 help me hit a curveball? 
 Try hitting a knuckleball. 
 You don't know what it is 
 until, pfft, it's too late. 
 That's old school. 
 I haven't even seen one in a game. 
 Oh, I used to throw 
 a knuckleball, actually, 
 back in the day. 
 I tried to be a pitcher. 
 But I didn't have a fastball... 
 And then you 
 have no idea where it's gonna go 
 'cause it had just a... 
 Just a slight amount of spin. 
 You heard? 
 Thank you for checking on me. 
 Andrews was right. 
 There's nothing more we could have done. 
 I'm really sorry about your patient, 
 but I actually came to tell you 
 that I'm meeting up 
 with some friends tonight. 
 I'm gonna go back to my place after. 
 Okay. 
 But what's wrong? 
 Nothing. 
 I've been meaning to see 
 these folks for a while, and... 
 we're meeting near my place. 
 No big deal. 
 Well, it's starting to feel like one. 
 Clearly, you're mad. 
 Please tell me what I did. 
 Sometimes having a conversation with you 
 feels like combat. 
 Well, I was just stating my opinion. 
 No, you were obliterating all 
 other opinions, including mine. 
 And calling me a complete 
 moron in the process. 
 I have never said that you were a moron. 
 - I said... 
 - Ash, I didn't grow up 
 discussing religion 
 or quoting Marx at the dinner table. 
 That doesn't mean 
 I don't value your opinion. 
 It doesn't seem like it 
 when you take a sledgehammer 
 to my every argument. 
 I can give you     examples 
 of times when... 
 This is not another argument 
 for you to win. 
 I have to get to dinner. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 If you want some company 
 or someone to talk to... 
 It's alright. I'll be okay. 
 I know. 
 But... 
 if you change your mind, 
 I've got your back. 
 Like you've had mine. 
 Thank you. 
 You... 
 really see me. 
 I think maybe you and I 
 could be gifts to each other. 
 And we should be open to that. 
 I have no idea what it looks 
 like for us to move forward. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 Dalisay. 
 Dr. Andrews. 
 Your landscapes you 
 showed Eddie before he... 
 I think you shared them with him 
 because he was so open-hearted. 
 See, my whole life, I've believed 
 that success only came 
 from constant striving, 
 constant dissatisfaction 
 with where I was 
 or what I'd accomplished. 
 Contentment was a sign of complacency. 
 That's no way to go through life. 
 I know. 
 And I know I didn't 
 show you enough respect, 
 and I didn't make enough effort 
 to see things from your point of view. 
 But I want to change. 
 I want to value the people I care about 
 and who might care about me. 
 And if I haven't screwed up 
 too badly, then maybe one day, 
 I'll be worthy enough 
 to see those landscapes. 
 How about dinner? 
 You pick me up at  :  , Saturday. 
 We can try that Filipino place. 
 Why would you say that? 
 - You know... 
 - Oh, man. 
 Hey, what else do you say 
 in that situation? 
 I think I agree with the guy. 
 I mean, I think he's... I think... 
 You were right. 
 I have a tendency to go 
 scorched earth in a debate 
 because I just want to win. 
 I lose sight of what's 
 important because I'm... 
 I-I'm a moron. 
 But today, I realized 
 I shouldn't take anything 
 or anyone for granted. 
 You showed me what 
 it truly means to belong, 
 to not be an island. 
 And I just feel so blessed 
 to be in your life. 
 Uh, and you should order 
 the salmon carpaccio. 
 It's delightful here. It's like butter. 
 Is your boyfriend 
 really that passionate, 
 or is he a little insane? 
 Both. 
 Hi. 
 I thought I'd stop by, 
 see how you and Eden are settling in. 
 We're fine, so far. 
 I think. 
 I'm fairly sure I have 
 everything Eden needs, 
 though peds might find 
 a few things missing 
 from their inventory this month. 
 I don't see one of these. 
 Oh. 
 Oh, Eden will love it. 
 Thank you. 
 Toys. 
 Onesies. I need to get a stroller... 
 Hey, you'll handle it. 
 It's the perfect practice run 
 for when your own comes along. 
 I'm going off my IVF meds. 
 I'm not doing another cycle. 
 Eden, 
 she's what I've been waiting for. 
 She's my daughter. 
 This is a knuckleball, and it fooled me. 
 I thought it was Dr. Glassman's 
 cancer returning, 
 but it is damage to Dr. Glassman's brain 
 as a result of a mini-stroke. 
 If that were the case, 
 the area would have smooth edges. 
 Mmm, usually, yes. 
 But rare presentations 
 can show abnormalities 
 like these rough edges, 
 particularly when the patient 
 has had radiation treatment. 
 It explains why his memory 
 has been impacted, 
 especially during periods 
 of intense focus 
 involving many sequential steps. 
 It is permanent. 
 He shouldn't be doing surgery anymore."

 [DR. ANDREWS] Dalisay! 
 I know I didn't show you enough respect, 
 and I didn't make enough effort to 
 see things from your point of view, 
 but I want to change. 
 How about dinner? 
 You pick me up at  :  , Saturday. 
 We can try that Filipino place. 
 I think maybe you and I 
 could be gifts to each other. 
 And we should be open to that. 
 I have no idea what it looks 
 like for us to move forward. 
 We'll figure it out. 
 It's a perfect practice run 
 for when your own comes along. 
 I'm going off my IVF meds. 
 I'm not doing another cycle. 
 Eden, she's what I've been waiting for. 
 She's my daughter. 
 I thought it was Dr. Glassman's 
 cancer returning, 
 but it is damage to Dr. Glassman's 
 brain as a result of a mini-stroke. 
 It is permanent. 
 He shouldn't be doing surgery anymore. 
 Ah. [GASPS] 
 Two weeks to Peanut Day! 
 Yes. 
 So you're making lasagna for breakfast? 
 It's going in the freezer. 
 I've packed my hospital bag, 
 written my Birth Plan, 
 and soon all I'll have on my list 
 is to do my nails and relax. 
 % of births happen 
 before the due date, 
 so you need to start 
 relaxing immediately. 
 'Cause if there's one thing 
 you can cram, it's relaxation. 
 Yes. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Have you heard anything from Glassy? 
 Hmm. Oh. No. 
 He might be mad when he finds out 
 you went to Lim with his brain scans. 
 It was very important for his future, 
 both medically and professionally. 
 Well, it's not just the information. 
 It's the whole behind-his-back thing. 
 He wouldn't listen to me, 
 so I had no choice. 
 I think you did the right thing, but... 
 just talk to him? 
 - Okay. 
 - Yeah. 
 I've had a stroke. 
 Yes. A small one. 
 - I should probably give you some time. 
 - Yeah, you should. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 He, uh, hit the brakes 
 instead of the gas 
 and thumped his head 
 on the steering wheel. 
 I'm a shoo-in for the Dumbest 
 Patient of the Day. [CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, it's too early to hand that out. 
 You want to hear about a dumb patient? 
 Doctor says to her 
 he's waiting for her X-ray. 
 She says, ""Well, that's weird. 
 I never dated anybody named Ray."" 
 A little too early for that, too. 
 [PEREZ] The laceration's superficial. 
 Couple stitches, and you're good to go. 
 - Yay! 
 - You sure? 
 He hit his head pretty hard. 
 Maybe you should run some tests? 
 There's no sign of fracture, 
 closed head injury, or brain bleed. 
 Dr. Murphy? 
 It's not about the accident. 
 He's been behaving very 
 strangely for the last six months. 
 Oh. He's alert, responsive, 
 engaging socially... 
 Which is nothing like him. 
 His whole life, he's been... terrible. 
 Constantly fired, 
 been through four divorces, 
 estranged from all of his kids, 
 except me. 
 He was always just... a d*ck. 
 Then he changed. 
 Now he's telling dad jokes, 
 asks about my day. 
 He gave me a birthday present. 
 He is a different person. 
 This does not sound to me 
 like a medical issue. 
 But I will order a brain MRI 
 because it would be 
 very interesting if it were! 
 [ETHEREAL VERSION OF 
 OPENING THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Are you mad at me, for going to Dr. Lim 
 with your brain scan? 
 Yeah, a little bit. 
 But maybe you saved my life, so... 
 I didn't think you were, 
 but Lea said you might be, 
 so we were both right. 
 What are you going to do? 
 About your job? 
 I don't know, Shaun. 
 I just found out I had a stroke. 
 I-I'm still reeling a little bit. 
 Maybe when I decide, 
 I'll let you know. 
 Okay. 
 I hear it beating! 
 Wow. Dr. Wolke has a heart? 
 I wasn't sure myself, to be honest. 
 - [LAUGHTER] 
 - I have one, too. 
 Now, that, we all knew. 
 Hey, Nico. 
 The doctors are gonna take Olivia 
 to get some ice cream 
 and you to get some tests. 
 Followed, of course, by some ice cream. 
 - Thanks, Dr. Marcus. 
 - Yeah. 
 Get some ice cream. 
 Nico's sarcoma has invaded 
 his thigh and hip, here and here. 
 But luckily, there's 
 no signs of metastasis, 
 which means we can debulk the tumor. 
 How much time would that give him? 
 Nine months, maybe even a year. 
 We could take him to Salzburg. 
 With Nico's illness 
 and all his surgeries, 
 he's never really had a great Christmas. 
 He found this photo of the 
 Salzburg Christmas Market in Austria. 
 He talks about it all the time. 
 This surgery could just get us there. 
 Not ""just."" 
 Th-There's always medical advances. 
 We have to be realistic, Seb. 
 And you have to keep 
 a positive attitude. 
 This is good news. 
 Some final pre-op testing, 
 and Nico can have his surgery tomorrow. 
 [EDEN CRYING] 
 [DR. REZNICK] Come on. 
 Be reasonable, please. 
 You've been fed, changed, swaddled. 
 I have walked. I have rocked. 
 I have bounced. 
 I've worn you on my front, 
 on my back, on my hip. 
 Shh. 
 Please, Eden. You have to go to sleep. 
 - Shh. 
 - [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 Be reasonable, please. Shh. 
 [CRYING STOPS] 
 Okay, okay, okay, okay. 
 [EDEN COOS] 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SIGHS] 
 [EDEN CRYING] 
 [MACHINERY WHIRRING] 
 So... you gonna tell me or not? 
 - Hmm? 
 - Where are we going tomorrow? 
 Oh, it's a surprise. 
 Hmm. 
 As in, you have no idea. 
 [SIGHS] It's been harder than I thought. 
 All right? A movie's too predictable, 
 an escape room is too dorky, 
 and, well, dinner at my place is out. 
 I'll pick something. 
 No, see, I don't want you 
 to deal with this. 
 It's supposed to be fun, Danny, 
 which it will be, 
 once we get over this first hump. 
 So let me do it, okay? 
 And, yes, I said ""hump,"" 
 which I regret saying 
 for multiple reasons. 
 [MOUSE CLICKS] 
 [MOUSE CLICKS] 
 His daughter was right. 
 I will take ace inhibitors, 
 aspirin, statins 
 to help reduce the likelihood 
 of future stroke 
 to near absolute zero. 
 I will reduce my workload by   %. 
 Any operation over six hours, 
 I will have a backup in the OR. 
 I will even eat more broccoli. 
 I'm not really comfortable with you 
 doing any surgery right now, 
 not until we've determined 
 the full extent of any 
 potential impairment. 
 Do I look impaired to you? 
 No, but I think 
 we should run a few tests. 
 Do you see any evidence at all 
 that my work has suffered? 
 You are a brain surgeon. 
 The margin of acceptable error 
 is miniscule. 
 I have a pretty good idea 
 of how precise I need to be. 
 I'm not comfortable with 
 subjecting any patient to that risk. 
 Most of the patients that I take on, 
 other surgeons won't even touch. 
 Without me, the likelihood 
 that they will die is    %. 
 I am not questioning your value. 
 I'm just asking that you wait 
 until there is no doubt. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 There's no such thing as ""no doubt."" 
 Aaron, I... 
 I cannot have you operating right now. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Then you will have to fire me. 
 And I will sue you. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 You know, I'm thinking 
 of cooking up 
 a batch of the world-famous 
 Poulet a la Andrews tonight. 
 I'm in. 
 Hmm. 
 But I want to give you 
 a courtesy heads up. 
 The nurses are gonna send out 
 an official e-mail 
 about a unionization drive. 
 I just increased the nursing budget. 
 More than a year ago. 
 And it mostly went to temps 
 or traveling nurses. 
 Not mostly. I can show you the numbers. 
 Point is, we're underpaid, 
 underappreciated. 
 A union could protect us. 
 Sorry to interrupt. 
 Got Nico's pre-op testing back. 
 His chemo hit his bone marrow hard. 
 Platelets only   k? 
 He can't have the surgery. 
 You have a large malignant 
 hemangiopericytoma 
 compressing your frontal lobes. 
 - Malignant? 
 - Yes. 
 But it's operable. 
 Which is good, 
 because if left untreated, 
 this would likely k*ll you 
 within a year. 
 - Okay. 
 - You were right. 
 The tumor is probably why 
 your father stopped being 
 ""a d*ck"" a few months ago. 
 Sorry, Dad. 
 It's all right. 
 I knew our relationship had improved. 
 I just didn't know 
 it was because of this. 
 So, if you remove it, 
 could that change my personality back? 
 Most likely. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Thank you, Doctor. 
 I'm gonna pass on the surgery. 
 If you want to bench our top surgeon, 
 you're gonna need more 
 than one indeterminate scan. 
 Are you worried about losing 
 our top surgeon or our top earner? 
 Why does everyone think wanting 
 to keep this hospital solvent 
 is something to be embarrassed about? 
 You want to open up the door 
 to another takeover? 
 I just want to be clear 
 about our agenda. 
 Well, then, let me clarify. 
 Yes, I'm worried about 
 losing our top earner, 
 but I'm more worried about Theo Singh, 
 the   -year-old newlywed 
 with the pilocytic astrocytoma. 
 We can refer him 
 to Dr. Cachoa at General. 
 Theo's tumor is compressing 
 his brain stem. 
 Cachoa probably won't even take him. 
 I can deal with that. 
 And you're doing it again. 
 My department, my call. 
 Once litigation is threatened, 
 it becomes my call. 
 Glassman refused cognitive testing, 
 and until I have more information, 
 I'm not letting him into the OR. 
 So he does all of his 
 surgeries as planned, 
 but with a backstop. 
 You assign another surgeon 
 on all of his cases 
 and not just the OR. 
 And he'll be happy with that? 
 It's a compromise. 
 Nobody's ever completely happy. 
 - I know I'm not. 
 - Neither am I. 
 The hallmark 
 of a successful negotiation. 
 [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 [EDEN CRYING] 
 I forgot you were coming. 
 That's odd, given how you read 
 my text ten minutes ago, but... 
 Beautiful, healthy baby. 
 Beautiful and healthy mom. 
 So it looks like things are going great. 
 Definitely. 
 Is she eating well? 
 - Like a horse. Shh, shh. 
 - Nice. 
 - Sleeping? 
 - Like a baby. 
 I underestimated diaper demand, 
 but everything else is... 
 perfect. 
 - [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 - Shh. It's okay. 
 When Kellan was fussy, 
 we'd put his car seat 
 on top of the washing machine. 
 The vibrations knocked him right out. 
 Well, this isn't like her. 
 Okay. Shh. 
 - You mind? 
 - [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 Ah. All right. 
 Oh, I've missed this. 
 [CRYING STOPS] 
 [GASPS] What? 
 [EDEN COOS] 
 See? Like a baby. 
 What? [GASPS] 
 My patient is refusing 
 the hemangiopericytoma 
 resection surgery 
 that will save his life. 
 I want you to talk him into it. 
 That's not how this works, Shaun. 
 It should be. 
 You are more persuasive than I am. 
 Ask Glassman. 
 He's removed more anterior fossa 
 tumors than anyone on the West Coast. 
 But Dr. Glassman should not 
 be doing any surgery until... 
 I agree, but I was overruled. 
 If you want someone 
 to change your patient's mind, 
 Glassman's your best shot. 
 You are persuasive. 
 [UPBEAT QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Nico's body isn't making the 
 blood cells and platelets he needs. 
 There's, uh... There's got to be 
 a way to get his counts up. 
 With Nico so sick... 
 it may be time to consider 
 palliative care. 
 - No. 
 - Let's hear the doctor out. 
 No, I'm not giving up on him. 
 Neither should you. 
 And neither should they. 
 [TALIA] Nico's been through so much. 
 You think I don't know that? 
 I'm trying to save his life. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Dr. Park will pull the team together 
 and see if there's a solution 
 that works for everyone. 
 Thank you. 
 So much. 
 He doesn't want his tumor removed, 
 so I don't know 
 what there is to discuss. 
 Given the tumor's impact 
 on his frontal lobes, 
 he might not be competent 
 to make that decision. 
 And you don't think I'm 
 competent to be a doctor, so... 
 Oh, no. Just to be a neurosurgeon. 
 The surgery should give Kurt 
 about    more years. 
 Let's recap,    more years 
 as a bad father 
 versus one year as a good father. 
 There is no medical justification... 
 Yes, there is, Shaun. Yes, there is. 
 There's an emotional one! 
 There's an emotional issue! 
 Your voice is getting louder, 
 and your face is flushed. Are you upset? 
 You should have come to me 
 with the scan. 
 You don't go to Lim. 
 You don't show it to Lim. 
 You said you were 
 only a little mad at me. 
 Y-You ratted me out 
 to the head of the department 
 when I specifically 
 asked you not to do that! 
 Yes, I did that because 
 you did not believe me... 
 Well, then, you come to me! 
 You try to convince me. 
 Again and again and again! 
 Don't you think you owe me that? 
 That's four times. 
 I tried a lot more than that. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 What do you want from me? 
 You want me to go with you to 
 see if he's competent? Is that it? 
 Okay. Fine. Let's go. 
 Hey. 
 Did Dr. Park find anything? 
 Not yet. 
 I just wanted to see 
 how you guys are doing. 
 Seb's with the kids. 
 I, um, needed a little break. 
 Seb and I used to talk 
 about how every day was a... 
 A beautiful day. 
 I remember. 
 Do you understand what will happen 
 if you don't have the operation? 
 Yes. I'll be dead within a year. 
 And why is that preferable to surgery? 
 Hailey was right about me. 
 I was a terrible person, 
 a terrible father. 
 Never played with her. 
 I hardly talked to her. 
 I can't even remember holding her hand. 
 The Wizard of Oz. 
 I was five, terrified 
 of the flying monkeys, 
 but when I reached for your hand... 
 I pulled it away. 
 I never tried to again. 
 I don't want to go back. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 I don't want to lose this. 
 I don't want to lose you. 
 The brain is a funny thing. 
 It wants to do the things 
 that makes it feel good, 
 get that dopamine hit. 
 In fact, it actually can reshape itself 
 as it continues to try to 
 experience those good feelings. 
 So you're saying I m-might... 
 be able to stay this way? 
 Maybe. 
 You work hard to be the best 
 version of the person you want to be. 
 I've had that fight. 
 You should listen to Dr. Glassman. 
 And he has removed 
 more anterior fossa tumors 
 than anyone on the West Coast. 
 Hey, I have faith in you, Dad. 
 You can do the work. 
 You could stay a good man. 
 Whew. 
 Well, uh, like the patient said, 
 ""I didn't want brain surgery, 
 but the doctor changed my mind."" 
 [SOFT CHUCKLING] 
 That... was a dad joke? 
 And a ""yes."" 
 If you do the surgery. 
 I've heard that you, uh, 
 know your way around a fossa tumor. 
 As you wish. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - So, what are we doing here? 
 - You don't remember? 
 A bicoronal subfrontal craniotomy. 
 - And? 
 - Possible orbital osteotomies. 
 Drill. 
 We would place a lumbar drain first. 
 Before incision, yes. 
 I thought I'd focus on the surgery. 
 [DRILL WHIRS] 
 Be careful of the sutura coronalis. 
 Why? Does the patient have one of those? 
 All higher primates do. 
 If you don't remember... 
 That was a joke. In the OR, 
 we call that a joke. 
 Hmm. 
 [WHIRRING] 
 Popping the top. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - And let's get under the lobes. 
 - Wait. 
 That is not the next step. It's... 
 Assessing and ligating 
 the anterior third. 
 I thought I'd do that 
 after I get a better view. 
 That... 
 is an acceptable option. 
 Wonderful. 
 But you must remember to... 
 Shaun, no more talking 
 while I'm doing this procedure. 
 This is my patient, 
 so I should be able to... 
 Shaun, I'm asking you to leave. 
 I will be quiet, but if another... 
 One of us is going to leave, Shaun. 
 It's not gonna be the one 
 doing the surgery. 
 Let's get after it. 
 We'd start with blood transfusions, 
 plus a cocktail of five medications 
 to ramp up production of blood cells. 
 That should get Nico 
 through the operation. 
 A few weeks later, we'd follow up 
 with a stem-cell 
 transplantation from one of you. 
 What could the side effects be? 
 Elevated risk of infection 
 and bleeds from the surgery 
 and possible toxicity 
 from drug interactions. 
 You know the alternative. 
 He'd be gone in just a few months. 
 If you were in our place, 
 what would you do? 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'd do the surgery. 
 [HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - Okay. 
 - Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 We'll prep Nico for surgery. 
 - [EDEN CRYING] 
 - Okay. 
 If this works, it'll be a real win-win 
 because one day 
 I do plan to do laundry again. 
 [DRYER RUNNING] 
 [CRYING STOPS] 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 All right, Eden. 
 I'm just gonna sit down for one sec. 
 [SIGHS] 
 [SNORING] 
 [RATTLING] 
 [GASPS] No! No. 
 [EDEN CRYING] 
 That'll stay just between us. 
 I want Shaun off the case. 
 It's his patient. 
 I don't want to crack a man's skull open 
 while standing next to someone 
 who's waiting for me to screw up. 
 I want a team I can trust    % 
 and who will trust me. 
 - Shaun's off the case. 
 - Thank you. 
 And I'll be assisting. 
 Welcome aboard. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] 
 This is nice. 
 [GLASSES CLINK] 
 Are you talking about the chicken? 
 - Not exclusively. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 I just hope it doesn't get 
 messed up by things at work. 
 The unionization drive. 
 What if I could squeeze the board? 
 Get them to sign off on some 
 real and meaningful improvements. 
 You might not even need a union. 
 Those would have to be 
 some pretty big concessions. 
 Okay. 
 How about a  % raise, 
 -to-  cap on nurse-to-patient ratios. 
 Might even be able to get a 
 Chief Nursing Officer on the board. 
 That's pretty interesting. 
 I have no idea if anyone else 
 would go for it. 
 Any chance you could find out? 
 Well, there's a big difference 
 how hard I can push 
 for a proposal that might work 
 versus one that will. 
 I could float it to a couple people. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 Dessert? 
 Yes. 
 As soon as the surgery's over, 
 the case is yours again. 
 I will watch from the gallery. 
 No need. I'll have a much 
 better view from the floor. 
 The video feed on the monitors 
 is excellent. 
 And it couldn't hurt 
 to have more backup. 
 Actually, it could, Shaun. 
 I was wrong, sending you to Glassman. 
 He's pretty upset right now, 
 and if you push it, 
 it could really hurt your relationship. 
 But if a doctor is making mistakes... 
 You don't have to be 
 the one to catch them, 
 not when others can. 
 Not when the doctor is your dad. 
 [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - [EDEN CRYING] 
 - There we go. There we go. 
 Come on. I have a few left. 
 It's okay. Don't worry. 
 Okay. 
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No! 
 I knew I was running out! I knew it. 
 What kind of mom runs out of diapers? 
 - [DOORBELL RINGS] 
 - [DR. PARK] Morgan? 
 [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 Eden, if you're alone, open the door! 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - I can't do this. 
 - Yes, you can. 
 I'm failing at everything. 
 [EDEN COOING] 
 You know, when Kellan was three months, 
 Mia had to go out of town. 
 It was my first time alone with him, 
 and he was teething. 
 It was  :   in the morning, 
 and neither of us had slept. 
 And suddenly... 
 Hmm. 
 I knew exactly how to fix everything. 
 One, or both, of us 
 was going out that window. 
 No one went out the window. 
 We both fell asleep. 
 Of the many times I've heard 
 about your failures, 
 none has ever made me happier. 
 You're not failing. You're just, uh... 
 muddling through. 
 I am not a muddler. 
 Mm. Every parent is. 
 Key is to not lose your mind 
 while you're muddling. 
 [EDEN COOS] 
 [GASPS] What? 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [DR. PARK] I've freed up 
 the lateral aspect. 
 [ASHER] Cauterizing. 
 [SIZZLING] 
 We're ready to take out the tumor. 
 Dr. Kalu, you want the honor? 
 [JARED] Thank you, Doctor. 
 There's mets all over his liver. 
 [ASHER] Can we resect 
 the most involved segments? 
 [DR. PARK] It's too widespread. 
 [JARED] So... what do we do? 
 We close him up and tell the family. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Start the timer. 
 Place the lumbar drain, please. 
 Hey. 
 - Tough day? 
 - Yeah, it was. 
 When I was arguing with the 
 board and fighting with Lim and... 
 I just found out 
 I got to tell a kid's parents 
 that a surgery I recommended failed 
 and their boy has a month to live. So... 
 that tipped it a bit beyond ""tough."" 
 I'll come back later. 
 No. Look. I'm sorry. I'm okay. 
 What's up? 
 - This may not be the time. 
 - No. It's fine. 
 I floated your idea to a few nurses. 
 They don't trust perks that 
 can be taken away at will. 
 They want a union. I'm sorry. 
 Which nurses? 
 - Their names? 
 - Yeah. 
 You're asking me to inform 
 on my co-workers? 
 I just need to know how serious this is. 
 Are we talking influential people 
 or some disgruntled part-timers? 
 [DRILL WHIRRING] 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 - [BEEP] 
 - No! 
 You need to use a Penfield dissector 
 to avoid lacerating the sagittal sinus. 
 - [DR. LIM] Dr. Murphy! 
 - I'm using the blunt end 
 of the drill bit instead. 
 [DRILL WHIRRING] 
 - [BEEP] 
 - Okay. Carry on. 
 Well, thank you. Speak again, 
 Dr. Murphy, and I'll have you removed. 
 [DRILL WHIRRING] 
 [JORDAN CLEARS THROAT] 
 I heard you were here, 
 and I said, ""Impossible, 
 because Lea and I talked about 
 how this is her very precious 
 and finite me-time."" 
 Tonight's the big date 
 with Perez, right? 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 - What are you gonna do? 
 I have no idea. 
 I thought of this Italian place, 
 but then I remembered they have 
 house wine on the tables 
 and figured 
 that might trigger a relapse. 
 And then I thought of indoor skydiving, 
 but what if he gets hurt? 
 - So I... 
 - You're really overthinking this. 
 I thought maybe he wasn't ready to date, 
 but now I'm thinking I'm not. 
 Maybe you're not, 
 but you're really gonna regret it 
 if you don't give it a shot. 
 Take him to the Batumi Grill, 
 order the khachapuri. 
 Now my Slanket is waiting. 
 Khachapuri. Okay. 
 - You're giving up? 
 - That's not what we... 
 You can't do this to us, to him. 
 I'm so sorry, Sebastian. 
 You can't promise that you have a 
 cure for my boy and then abandon us. 
 - There's nothing we can do. 
 - So find another surgery. 
 We need to focus on improving 
 the quality of the time Nico has left. 
 Do not tell me where to focus. 
 He's my son. 
 I don't... I don't... 
 I don't want quality time. 
 - All I want is my boy. 
 - Seb. 
 - I'm talking to him. 
 - You're being selfish. 
 Forcing any more operations 
 will only cause Nico more pain, 
 and you and Talia and Olivia 
 will have terrible memories 
 of his last days. 
 I don't care about memories. 
 You should. 
 Because soon they are all you'll have. 
 [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [TALIA] Hey. 
 You wouldn't let me give up before. 
 And you were right. 
 But now it's time. 
 Dads are supposed to 
 fight for their kids. 
 So you fight... 
 to give your son as many 
 beautiful days as you can. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING]

 No. Just stretching. 
 Okay.

 - There's a lot of bleeding. 
 - [DR. GLASSMAN] Vascular clips. 
 [DR. LIM] Must be a tear 
 in the anterior cerebrals. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] No, 
 it's from the dural feeders. 
 Hmm. As expected. 
 - And there we are. 
 - [DR. LIM] Hmm. 
 [PEREZ] Oh, the bleeding's stopped. 
 [DR. LIM] Nice. 
 [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] 
 - [BEEP] 
 - No! 
 Dr. Glassman, please tell us 
 what the next step is. 
 You hesitated. 
 You need to say 
 what comes next in the surgery. 
 Somebody please call security. 
 Shaun, you are out of line. 
 [DR. LIM] Answer. 
 Please. 
 [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] 
 It's, um... 
 [DR. LIM] We need to decompress

 Hey. 
 The patient's in recovery. 
 Your surgical plan was flawless. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Alison Borden. 
 -year-old mother of two. 
 My first solo surgery. 
 Frontal AVM. It was a walk in the park. 
 I was pumped. I was flying. 
 And then... her feeding artery tore... 
 and I couldn't stop the bleeding. 
 Bipolaring, clipping, suturing. 
 We thought we were gonna lose her. 
 And I couldn't get 
 this image out of my mind 
 of her kids coming home from school 
 and seeing their father 
 just sitting there, you know? 
 Finally, I stuck a neuro-patty 
 on a muscle patch graft. 
 That did it. It held. 
 And when I walked out of that OR, 
 I thought, ""I am never 
 going back in there again."" 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Then I saw Alison in recovery. 
 Husband, kids. All smiles. 
 She gave me a big hug. 
 Despite my raging ego... 
 I've tried... I've always tried 
 to make it about the patients. 
 To do what's best for them. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I never thought that would mean 
 putting down my knife. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING]

 [GROANS SOFTLY]

 We were able to completely 
 remove your tumor. 
 Hey. Dad. How are you feeling? 
 Well, my head kind of hurts. 
 I bet. 
 I gave you that locket. 
 Yeah. 
 For my last birthday. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah, that seems like a long time ago.

 Congratulations. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Morning, ladies. 
 Eden, clocking in today? 
 My trial had three participants 
 drop out at the last minute, 
 and every available nanny 
 within    miles 
 is either dumb, lazy, or incompetent. 
 Mommy Morgan has 
 very exacting standards. 
 I'm willing to lower them 
 momentarily if you're available. 
 I just need a few minutes 
 to give my spiel 
 to a room full of 
 perimenopausal IBS patients. 
 I would, but I just got paged 
 to the E.R. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 I'll stop by later. 
 [EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Be professional. 
 At least five seriously injured 
 multi-vehicle collision 
 patients are inbound, 
 including Dr. Perez. 
 I'll take the first patient. 
 Then Dr. Park, 
 then Andrews, Wolke, and Allen, 
 in that order. 
 Senior doctors, when you have 
 stabilized your patients, 
 please circle back 
 and assist the residents. 
 - [SIREN WAILING] 
 - Take a deep breath, everybody. 
 Driver of the last car of the 
 pile-up... head-on collision. 
 Conscious, has a pulse, 
 but not responding. 
 Suspected cervical spinal cord 
 and brachial plexus injury. 
 Chest hurts. 
 Where's my phone? I need to make a call. 
 You'll get your phone call 
 soon, Mr. Ermey. 
 Get an eFAST and assess for shock. 
 Let's fix that lac. 
 I need to drain the hemopericardium. 
 Give FFP to control the bleeding. 
 Fracture of the right femoral 
 shaft and left distal radius. 
 We got it. 
 - Hey, are you okay? 
 - I'm... I'm good. 
 Where's Perez? 
 Kalu is bringing him 
 in the last ambulance. 
 So, he's the least critical? 
 He's... 
 He'll be here soon. 
 Multiple rib fractures 
 and associated pneumothorax. 
 [GROANS] It hurts. 
 Hey, I'm Dr. Wolke. 
 We're gonna help you, okay? 
 Finally. 
 [GROANS] 
 Still no purposeful eye 
 or limb movements. 
 Likely a high c-spine fracture. 
 Let's get her stabilized 
 for a trauma pan-scan. 
 Massive right-side hemopneumothorax, 
 but she's holding her own on vitals. 
 - She needs a chest tube. 
 - What does that mean? 
 - Is... Is she gonna... 
 - She's gonna be okay. 
 We just need to make sure that 
 you and the little one are good. 
 - If you could take a seat... 
 - I-I-I'm fine. Just a bruise from my... 
 Yes, I know you feel fine, 
 but we need to make sure. 
 I-It's okay, Bea. 
 Um, I-I-I got to call my wife. 
 She doesn't even know 
 any of this happened. 
 [JORDAN] Abdominal ecchymosis, 
 peritoneal hemorrhage, 
 possible hemothorax. 
 You're bleeding everywhere. 
 Call up to O.R. 
 for an emergency ex lap. 
 No opioids. 
 What? 
 Just promise me. 
 No opioids. 
 Okay. 
 [GROANS] 
 Tell the anesthesiologist opioid-free. 
 ELLA: Ow! 
 Considerable intraperitoneal fluid. 
 She has a perforation and needs 
 abdominal surgery right away. 
 No! Dad! 
 It's gonna be okay, baby. 
 Mommy will be here soon, 
 and we'll all play Scrabble. 
 [SOBBING] 
 We think you suffered a neck injury, 
 but we need to get some images 
 so we can tell for sure. 
 Hey. 
 All stabilizing ligaments 
 have been completely severed. 
 Internal decapitation. 
 Have you ever worked on one of these? 
 Never even seen one. 
 Why aren't you in your patient room? 
 Oh, I had some last-minute 
 e-mails to send, 
 and my preggo-brain 
 forgot my laptop in here. 
 Did you get my socks? 
 Is there something wrong with your room? 
 We could get you extra blankets. 
 What is this? 
 This is the cutest hat I've ever seen. 
 Oh! I got one for each of us. 
 Shaun, I love them. 
 We should take it to Glassy. 
 We should go to your room. 
 I-I know things are... 
 difficult between you two right now, 
 but his grandson is being born today. 
 He knows. 
 He said, ""Congratulations,"" 
 and then he shut the door. 
 Mm. 
 We need to get you hooked up 
 to a fetal monitor. 
 The surgery went well. 
 We repaired Ella's bowel perforation. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Mommy, did you bring snacks? 
 We'll go to the cafeteria together 
 as soon as we're done 
 talking to the doctors. 
 When can she go home? 
 Uh, there was some damage to her spleen. 
 Uh, we'll need to monitor that 
 for the next few days, 
 make sure it doesn't get worse. 
 But I'll keep you updated. 
 I've got to be in the O.R. 
 in    minutes for my valve replacement. 
 Order a post-op CT 
 and run serial hematocrits. 
 Mm. Sorry. 
 I'm not used to having 
 consultations in my kitchen. 
 I've never seen that much 
 separation between skull and spine. 
 - Have you? 
 - Not in anyone alive. 
 I was thinking occipitocervical 
 fusion surgery 
 using a plate with four-point fixation 
 and transpedicular 
 and translaminar screws. 
 You're gonna have to add 
 iliac crest graft and Songer cables. 
 You're looking at over 
 two hours just to realign 
 and stabilize the skull and the spine, 
 and then the real work begins. 
 Your odds of success are somewhere 
 between minimal and nonexistent. 
 Well, marathons are pointless, 
 but millions of people run them anyway. 
 Feel like running? 
 I've been deemed ""unfit."" 
 You wouldn't be cutting. 
 You'd be consulting. 
 Flattering. 
 You're still one of the world's 
 foremost experts 
 on the brain and spine, 
 and my patient's head 
 is hanging on by a thread. 
 This one's scary. I could use some help. 
 Sure. 
 I'm up for some... color commentary. 
 You have another contraction 
 coming in one to two seconds, 
 and it is a big... 
 [GROANS] 
 ...one. 
 They are now six minutes apart 
 and increasing in intensity. 
 We should have the nurse 
 check your dilation again. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Hi. Big day. Excited for you both. 
 Everyone is busy 
 because of the accident... 
 Lim is prepping, Andrews 
 and Park are in surgery... 
 and I think my patient is in trouble. 
 Her latest CT shows her 
 splenic injury is getting worse. 
 How's Perez doing? 
 They're just finishing up 
 his surgery now. 
 Your patient needs 
 a splenic artery embolization. 
 How long can she wait? 
 There are no attendings available. 
 She cannot wait. 
 Shaun... 
 you need to do the surgery. 
 I... should be here with you, 
 to give you ice chips 
 and hold your hand 
 and talk about the future. 
 Have you been watching movies 
 about people having babies? 
 I'm fine. 
 I have hours to go before 
 the Peanut makes his debut, 
 and how complicated is this procedure? 
 It is quite straightforward. 
 I love you, and I'm so happy 
 we're starting our family. 
 But there's a little girl who needs you. 
 Please, go. 
 Okay. Prep the O.R. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Do not have this baby without me! 
 [GROANS] 
 No opioids. 
 Thank you. 
 You want the itemized list? 
 Multiple displaced rib fractures, 
 contusions on both lungs, 
 abdominal bleeding, 
 and a fractured pancreas, 
 which is as painful as it gets. 
 [GASPING] 
 Danny, you need to let me 
 give you pain meds, 
 - real pain meds. 
 - No. 
 I've already got you on 
 acetaminophen, lidocaine, 
 gabapentin, and magnesium. 
 Your heart rate and BP 
 are still elevated. 
 You are at risk 
 for a heart attack or stroke. 
 No. 
 I worked way too hard getting sober. 
 I can't go back to square one. 
 You need opioids. 
 What I need... 
 is to hear you tell me 
 about our dinner tonight. 
 Please. 
 Distract me. 
 The restaurant is very romantic... 
 tablecloths and candles everywhere. 
 And the music isn't so loud 
 that it drowns out all conversation. 
 [GROANING] 
 The trial starts Monday. 
 You'd only be in-patient for three days, 
 then weekly check-ins for six weeks. 
 I suppose I could hire a dog-sitter. 
 - [EDEN FUSSING] 
 - But Lincoln doesn't like new people. 
 Or tall people. Or men. 
 Can you excuse me for just one second? 
 She's the sweetest girl. 
 She prefers to face out, be involved. 
 Yeah. Better. 
 I'm almost done here. 
 I need to push my  :   p.m. 
 to  :   p.m., my  :   p.m. to tomorrow. 
 So, is it three days and two nights? 
 - Or three days and three nights? 
 - [FUSSING CONTINUES] 
 Sorry. A little more head support. 
 No, not like that. 
 Just... 
 Here we go. Right there. 
 I need to go. Lincoln's waiting. 
 No. Wait. Barbara, it's... 
 it's two nights. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Please go talk to him. 
 Shouldn't you be in a room 
 somewhere, having a baby? 
 Congratulations, by the way. 
 You two cannot be in a fight today. 
 It's not a fight. 
 I know it's a big deal, 
 but can you please put it aside, 
 at least for today? 
 I got to go to the O.R. 
 This is probably the most 
 important day of Shaun's life. 
 He needs his father. 
 [LIQUID DRIPPING] 
 Oh, my God. 
 Either my water just broke, 
 or I just peed all over your office. 
 - Either way, it would be a first. 
 - [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 - You have plenty of time. 
 - Here, let me help you. 
 No, no. I'm married to Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 He has walked me through the steps 
 of the birthing process 
 many, many times. 
 I can take it from here. 
 Please go talk to him. 
 I'll call janitorial. 
 I just... 
 Gail, always a nice surprise, 
 but you caught me on a busy day. 
 Well, sadly, 
 I'm about to make it busier. 
 The board's calling an 
 emergency meeting for tonight. 
 Okay, and what is the board 
 defining as an emergency today? 
 You, Marcus. 
 And how you're going to handle 
 the nurses' push to unionize. 
 I'm on top of it. 
 That's the problem. 
 The splenic artery embolization 
 went very well. 
 Your daughter should not need 
 any more surgeries. 
 [ASHER] She'll need to spend 
 the next few days in the hospital 
 until we can remove her NG tube, 
 - get her back on regular... 
 - [GROANS] 
 Honey? Wha... 
 - What's happening? 
 - Profoundly hypotensive. 
 - Kenny! 
 - Pulse disparity between arms. 
 This is likely an aortic dissection. 
 We need to get him to an O.R., stat. 
 [BREATHING SHALLOW] 
 Reasonably happy in this life... 
 Supremely happy with You 
 forever in the next. 
 - Amen. 
 - [MONITOR ALARM BEEPS] 
 Danny, your BP's     over    , 
 heart rate    . 
 You're having a hypertensive crisis. 
 You need fentanyl. 
 The pain is k*lling you. 
 God, grant me the serenity 
 to accept the things 
 I cannot change... 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
 He asked you not to do that. 
 He's not responding 
 to the antihypertensive drips. 
 Right, so up the dose. 
 He's tachycardic and 
 hypertensive because of the pain. 
 He's going into shock. 
 - He's not. He's praying. 
 - He's dying. 
 The courage to change 
 the things I can... 
 That prayer is what starts 
 every NA meeting. 
 He is clinging onto his sobriety. 
 ...and the wisdom 
 to know the difference. 
 [GROANS] 
 [BOTH] And wisdom 
 to know the difference. 
 He's admitting he doesn't 
 know what to do. 
 He's asking God to help him. 
 I'm helping him. You can leave. 
 Accepting hardship 
 as a pathway to peace... 
 [GROANS] 
 Living one day at a time... 
 [ALARM CONTINUES] 
 Enjoying one moment at a time... 
 Forever in the next. Amen. 
 - Forgive me.

 [ALARM STOPS, BEEPING RESUMES] 
 Accepting hardship 
 as a pathway to peace. 
 [BREATHING SHAKILY] 
 [SHAUN] We need to place the graft 
 to replace the descending 
 and thoracic aorta. 
 [ASHER] We need six more units of blood. 
 I did a full exam in the E.R. 
 I mean, the imaging was clear. 
 There were no signs of dissection. 
 Trim the distal aorta. 
 It must have started 
 small enough to be undetected. 
 His blood pressure 
 gradually expanded the tear 
 until it ruptured. 
 Oh. 
 There's a false lumen. 
 It extends past the carotid. 
 The graft... 
 won't work. 
 [FLATLINES] 
 [ASHER] Well, can you... 
 Can you have one of your visions? 
 Come on, Shaun. There must be something. 
 For his family. 
 He's lost more than half 
 his blood volume. 
 His brain has been 
 underperfused for too long. 
 Time of death... 
 :   p.m. 
 You might have mentioned 
 you were one of the organizers 
 behind the nurses' unionization push. 
 Does it matter? 
 Not to me, but the board 
 feels differently. 
 Apparently, our relationship is why 
 I haven't been coming down hard 
 on the nurses. 
 I can personally attest that you've been 
 a total pain about it the whole time. 
 Cute. They're threatening my job. 
 I don't want you to 
 lose your job over us. 
 I don't want to lose you over my job. 
 [DR. LIM] You know, Shaun and 
 Lea are having their baby today. 
 Yes, I'm aware. 
 [DR. LIM] Have you talked to him? 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] I said, 
 ""Congratulations."" 
 [DR. LIM] Well, the alignment 
 looks much better, 
 but she could have horrible stenosis. 
 Are you planning on talking to him? 
 Beyond one word? 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] I'd decompress 
 the C  with a laminectomy. 
 [DR. LIM]You know, a crotchety, 
 old, wise man once told me 
 that hanging onto my anger was toxic. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] I'm not ""crotchety."" 
 [DR. LIM] You were right then. 
 And I'm right now. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN ] He publicly 
 humiliated me yesterday, 
 as everyone in this room 
 is quite well aware. 
 [DR. LIM] Well, he's having 
 his baby today. 
 Pass me two   -mill 
 pedicle screws, please. 
 - I'll take those. 
 - [DR. GLASSMAN] Right. 
 Old habit. 
 I saw your family leave a while ago. 
 Are they getting a hotel? 
 You gave me fentanyl. 
 I did. 
 Was it a hard decision? 
 Overriding my wishes? 
 Honestly? 
 No. 
 You were on the verge of a heart attack. 
 - Or brain bleed. 
 - Yeah, but not definitively. 
 I wasn't willing to risk your 
 life waiting for ""definitively."" 
 But you were okay sending me 
 back to certain opiate addiction. 
 I couldn't... 
 let you die. 
 [KNOCKS] 
 I stopped by to offer my nanny services. 
 But it looks like you're all set. 
 I got all three participants locked in. 
 Trial's starting on time. 
 Now I just need to tell Andrews 
 that I'm done. 
 Done? 
 With this job. 
 Look, you've had a long day. 
 But you'll find a rhythm. And a nanny. 
 I can't do this job as well as I want 
 and take care of Eden as well as I need. 
 I've made the mistake of putting my 
 career ahead 
 of the people I love before. 
 I'm not doing it again. 
 The nurses put a chair 
 next to the table for you, 
 if you would like to sit. 
 Is it okay to touch him? 
 Yes. 
 Just don't remove the sheet. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 He was just here. 
 How am I gonna tell my girls? 
 I don't think I can do 
 any of this without him. 
 When my brother Steve died, 
 I didn't know how I would survive. 
 He had always taken care of me. 
 But I did. 
 Because someone else came into my life 
 who took care of me and loved me. 
 Now he may be gone, too. 
 It is very hard to lose people 
 you thought would never leave. 
 But you will... 
 be okay because you have no choice. 
 When we lose people we love, 
 we have to find a way to keep going 
 for the people we still have. 
 [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 Take as much time as you need. 
 I'm going to have a baby now. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Oh, you're back. 
 How's the little girl? 
 She will be okay. 
 Mm. 
 How far apart are the contractions? 
 About two minutes. 
 Okay. 
 It is time to start pushing. 
 Are you sure? 
 I don't... I don't feel anything. 
 That's because of the epidural, 
 but your prostaglandin E  and E  levels 
 are at peak concentration 
 for stimulating 
 myometrial contractility. 
 It is time. 
 Oh. 
 I'll gown up and be right back. 
 I will refill your water bottle 
 and get an extra pillow. 
 Do you want a warm or cold washcloth? 
 Either is fine, but I-I need more time. 
 Delaying delivery can cause 
 excessive postpartum bleeding, 
 plus an increase 
 in bacterial infections. 
 I'll get one warm and one cold. 
 Shaun, wait. Come here a minute. 
 I'm scared. 
 Really, really scared. 
 It is... 
 common for women to be anxious 
 about the birthing process. 
 For nine months, my whole goal 
 was to keep this baby 
 in my belly, safe 
 and sound and protected. 
 And now it feels like 
 I'm supposed to just 
 shove my own heart into the world and... 
 and let it walk around 
 all exposed and vulnerable 
 and so, so tiny. 
 And I'm not gonna be able 
 to protect him anymore. 
 It will be okay. 
 Probably. 
 I am very excited to meet our son. 
 I'm really excited, too. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, let's... let's do this. 
 Okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You're two hours out of surgery. 
 Lie down. 
 When can I get back to the home? 
 I need to take your vitals. 
 Ehh. 
 Want us to call your family? 
 I got to call Martha. 
 - Wife? Girlfriend? 
 - Neither. 
 We take walks every morning 
 with about    other old farts 
 from the home... 
 all waking up to watch the damn sunrise. 
 Not your preferred activity? 
 Doc, if God wanted us 
 to see the sunrise, 
 he would have put it at 
 a more reasonable hour. 
 You go because Martha's there. 
 I think it's time I told her... 
 she's the reason I wake up 
 in the morning. 
 Let's give her a call. 
 Thanks. 
 You're all right, Doc. 
 I went through my patient record. 
 You made the right call. 
 Thank you. 
 But... 
 I'm going to need all the help 
 I can get to recover 
 without relapsing. 
 I... 
 need to go back to Texas with my family. 
 I knew when I gave you the dr*gs, 
 I might lose you. 
 And it wasn't a hard decision? 
 The decision was easy. 
 The aftermath is... 
 Well, I'm not going anywhere 
 until we have our date. 
 Are you free tonight? 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 The levator ani muscle is 
 undergoing a stretch ratio 
 - of  .  , which is normal.

 Shaun, I need you up here, 
 not down there. 
 Why isn't he coming out? 
 [DR. GLENN] The little guy is 
 just progressing slowly. 
 I think we need a vacuum 
 assist to help... 
 You want to vacuum my baby out of me? 
 [SHAUN] It is standard protocol 
 if a baby is stalled in the birth canal. 
 I covered this in the e-mail 
 about instrum... 
 There were a lot of e-mails, Shaun. 
 Okay. 
 [WHIMPERS] 
 Is it safe for the baby? 
 Mm. 
 Will he have a cone-head? 
 Only for approximately    hours. 
 Okay, mama. You ready? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 [WHIMPERS] 
 I am here for you. 
 You can squeeze my hand. 
 [GROANING] 
 [SCREAMS] 
 You're doing great. He's almost here. 
 [GASPS] 
 [BABY CRYING] 
 Oh! 
 Congratulations, Mom and Dad. 
 Ooh. 
 Oh, I can't believe 
 you're finally here, Peanut. 
 He doesn't look like an alien at all. 
 His... head has a very nice shape. 
 Yeah. 
 He is beautiful. 
 Dr. Murphy, would you like 
 to do the honors? 
 Yes. 
 I would very much like to do that. 
 [LEA] Hi. 
 Look at what we made. 
 Hello. 
 It is very nice to meet you. 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I'm your dad. 
 You think anybody would notice 
 if we took this home with us? 
 I think you should leave it. 
 I wasn't really going to take it. 
 Oh, sure you were. 
 But... 
 I don't think you should resign. 
 Because you don't have to 
 do it all alone. 
 You're the reason 
 I wake up in the morning. 
 So, whatever there is to figure out, 
 all I want in the world is 
 for us to do it as a family. 
 I love you, too. 
 [ENID FUSSING] 
 She has a dirty diaper. 
 And I have    lab reports to review. 
 [EDEN FUSSING] 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Thank you... 
 for saving my life. 
 You're very welcome. 
 I-I, um... I didn't mean today. 
 I meant when you made looking 
 for a foot in a lake fun. 
 When you sat next to me 
 in church, quietly, 
 knowing that was exactly what I needed. 
 And, uh, when you trusted me... 
 even though I'm pretty sure 
 I didn't deserve it. 
 And, of course, today. 
 You make me believe that I can do this. 
 You will be okay. 
 I'm gonna miss you. 
 Thank you. 
 I love a sunset as much as anyone, 
 but isn't this a little 
 sentiment over science? 
 There's a case study out of Alabama... 
 internal decapitation. 
 They took the patient out every night... 
 sunset, beautiful sky, and fresh air 
 to help stimulate the brain. 
 How long before they got a response? 
 A couple days, but it worked. 
 Hey, how can you argue with a 
 thing called ""Operation Sunset""? 
 Your family is coming. 
 I know they'd love to see 
 you smile, or even a blink. 
 Or you could just flip us off 
 because you're cold 
 and you're afraid of heights. 
 You've got your methods, I've got mine. 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 - Whatever works. 
 Shaun and Lea had their baby. 
 Do you want to go meet him? 
 I think I'll stay here. Thank you. 
 I know that losing surgery 
 is devastating. 
 Don't let losing one great love 
 cost you another.

 Just promise me. 
 - What? 
 - No opioids. 
 He asked you not to do that. 
 He's tachycardic and hypertensive 
 because of the pain. 
 He's going into shock. 
 - He's not. He's praying. 
 - He's dying. 
 Forgive me. 
 I need to go back to Texas 
 with my family. 
 You made an error 
 in yesterday's craniotomy. 
 You closed with only eight sutures. 
 The size of the wound required 10. 
 We need to figure out why. 
 I've had a stroke. 
 Yes. A small one. 
 Dr. Glassman, please tell us 
 what the next step is. 
 Somebody please call security. 
 Shaun, you are out of line. 
 Answer. 
 It's, um... 
 You humiliated me in public 
 in my operating room 
 in front of my colleagues. 
 Do you have any idea how much that hurt? 
 I don't know what to do. 
 You can just leave me alone. 
 I don't think you should resign. 
 Because you don't 
 have to do it all alone. 
 You're the reason

 I've decided to resign. 
 Congratulations, Mom and Dad. 
 Look at what we made. 
 Do you think Dr. Glassman is coming? 
 This is from Dr. Glassman. 
 How did he know his name would be Steve? 
 Because he knows you. 
 Gloves. 
 Start the timer, please. 
 Good luck, babe. It's a doozy. 
 Good work. 
 I think that was your fastest yet. 
 Second-fastest. 
 is starting now. 
 I will log it into my app. 
 You sure you don't want to 
 get in a few extra snuggles 
 before you leave? 
 Oh, I had 10 minutes 
 of snuggles this morning. 
 Very nice. 
 I've also set up the app on your phone. 
 It will alert you when it's time 
 for Steve's nap, feeding, playtime... 
 Just in case I miss the 
 schedules posted on the fridge, 
 the bathroom, and in our bedroom. 
 Yes. And I will be able to 
 track it while I'm at work. 
 Steve and I will be fine. 
 Just enjoy your first day back. 
 We can finish reading the latest 
 Journal of Trauma 
 and Acute Care Surgery 
 when I get home. 
 After this, Steve should have at least 
 five minutes of tummy time. 
 Yesterday, he only logged 12 minutes, 
 which is three less than... 
 I love you. 
 Say hi to everyone for me. 
 Okay. I love you, too. 
 I will miss you both. 
 I don't know why you need three 
 protein powders, for your smoothies. 
 They do different things. 
 She's barely taken an ounce. 
 That's what the protein-powder 
 companies want you to believe. 
 - Are you holding her right? 
 - Yes. 
 She needs to be upright with 
 her head properly supported. 
 Good. And you mixed it enough? 
 The same as always. 
 She's not interested again. 
 And she seems lethargic. 
 I'll take her to get checked out. 
 Well, I'd like to come, too. 
 Sure. You can carry this. 
 - Good morning. 
 - How's Perez today? 
 Don't know. 
 It's almost 8:00 a.m. 
 It's been ""today"" for 
 a whole eight hours. 
 You two haven't texted each other yet? 
 We both decided we need space. 
 He's focused on his recovery. 
 I've got my life here. 
 I fully support that. 
 And your next chapter begins tonight. 
 You and me. Drinks, music, 
 questionable decisions. 
 You and Jerome finally got the surgery! 
 You're no longer joined at the hip? 
 Jerome is obsessed with some docuseries 
 about one of the many sports 
 that I don't care about. 
 Come on. It's been too long. 
 I've been busy. You've been... 
 mopey. 
 Fine. I agree to drinks and music, 
 but I'm definitely a ""maybe"" 
 on questionable decisions. 
 - Alright. We'll work up to it. 
 - Okay. 
 We're going out tonight for 
 drinks, starting a new chapter. 
 That's right. We're calling it 
 ""Bad decisions with good friends."" 
 We're definitely not calling it that. 
 Wanna join? 
 No, thank you. 
 Papa Murphy, welcome back. 
 Pictures of Steve. 
 I was just about to ask. 
 This way, I avoid the disruption 
 of pulling out my phone. 
 Look at that smile! Just like his mom! 
 He was pooping in that one. 
 Here he is... about to poop. 
 A theme develops. 
 Aww. He's got your eyes, Shaun. 
 I need to find Dr. Lim. 
 You may keep those. 
 I made enough for everyone. 
 Marcus sends greetings from Spain. 
 Oh, I thought he was at a 
 meditation retreat in Vietnam. 
 He was, and now he's walking 
 the Camino de Santiago. 
 How nice for him. 
 I'm two surgeons down with no 
 one to approve hiring a new one. 
 I need the Board to appoint 
 an Interim President, stat. 
 Just as long as it's not O'Brien. 
 They wouldn't. 
 I heard from a staffer 
 who covers Board Meetings 
 that his name's on the short list. 
 Ugh. Of the worst possible 
 candidates for the position. 
 Good morning! Pictures of Steve. 
 Aww. 
 You no longer have your cane. 
 Yeah. PT said I was ready. 
 I'm glad to have you back. 
 I would like to join your case. 
 He's adorable, Dr. Murphy. Welcome back. 
 Shaun, I'm thrilled to see you, 
 but I'm not sure this is the 
 case where you want to start 
 as a new dad. 
 It is an exciting 
 and challenging surgery. 
 Thank you for coming in 
 on such short notice. 
 Hello. I am Dr. Shaun Murphy, 
 attending surgeon 
 and father of a baby boy. 
 He is two weeks old, and 
 today is my first day back, 
 but that will not affect my 
 performance as your son's doctor. 
 Is it true there might be 
 a heart for Jack? 
 Yes, but the heart isn't available yet, 
 and we may not get it once it is. 
 We've been through this before. 
 Why isn't the heart available yet? 
 Well, the donor family is still 
 saying their goodbyes before 
 they turn off life support. 
 Jack is an excellent match 
 for the donor heart, 
 and his latest echo indicates 
 that his cardiomyopathy 
 and overall cardiac function 
 has worsened, so he should 
 be at the top of the list. 
 I just want to run some additional tests 
 to make sure he's otherwise healthy. 
 There is a problem. 
 There is a small scratch, 
 likely from his fingernails, 
 which has developed cellulitis 
 and an abscess. 
 If the infection spreads 
 and he spikes a fever, 
 Jack will be ineligible 
 for the transplant. 
 We have to lance 
 and debride it right away. 
 Morning. 
 Hi. 
 This is Steve, our son, 
 who is now two weeks old. 
 Steve, this is the grumpy man 
 who lives down the hall 
 and gave you your favorite blanket. 
 Shaun was very impressed 
 you guessed his first name. 
 Wanna take a s*ab at the middle? 
 Aaron. 
 I was lobbying pretty hard for Bowie, 
 because why not name your kid after 
 the coolest person who every lived? 
 But... Shaun insisted. 
 You should come over sometime. 
 You two both grunt a lot 
 and make strange faces. 
 I've got a lot going on, so... 
 We live next door. 
 You have nothing going on. 
 You're mad. And I get it. 
 But are you really gonna ignore 
 Shaun and Steve and me forever? 
 Is that the plan? 
 I'm not ignoring you. 
 And he's beautiful. 
 Congratulations. 
 I tried. 
 Any cyanosis while eating? 
 Maybe a hint of bluishness 
 on her lips last night. 
 I haven't noticed anything. 
 But given her prior surgery 
 and the Turner syndrome, 
 I thought we should... 
 The blood flow is reduced. 
 It looks like Eden's aortic stenosis 
 has progressed more rapidly 
 than we were expecting. 
 Can we put her on beta blockers? 
 We can try, but given how 
 dysplastic the valve is, 
 I don't think it will do much good. 
 You'll want to get more imaging, but... 
 I think Eden's gonna need 
 another surgery... very soon. 
 Cardiac MRI confirmed 
 severe narrowing of the valve, 
 obstruction, and left 
 ventricular dysfunction. 
 Eden needs a new aortic valve, 
 or her heart failure will get worse. 
 Are you thinking mechanical 
 or cryopreserved h*m* 
 for the replacement? 
 Mechanical valve for a neonate 
 needs to be built, 
 and it will require future surgeries 
 plus lifetime blood thinners. 
 Cryopreserved valves risk 
 degeneration down the line, 
 but it is a solid idea, 
 especially as part 
 of the Ross Procedure. 
 Possible complications? 
 Aortic insufficiency, 
 pulmonary stenosis. 
 We can take some time, discuss 
 the different options... 
 Do the Ross Procedure. 
 I'll have Asher get her prepped. 
 It's time to get off the sidelines. 
 I'm not sure what you're referring to. 
 Are you gonna throw me a ball? 
 You've run the hospital before. 
 You can handle a few more months. 
 I can, but why would I want to? 
 - That's a no? 
 - Yes. 
 Get ready for Interim President O'Brien. 
 They would never. 
 That's like Mao meets Basil Fawlty. 
 Wow. That's two obscure 
 and 
 dated references. 
 They're never gonna move on O'Brien. 
 Well, apparently, he's on 
 the Board's short list. 
 Throw your hat in the ring, 
 he won't stand a chance. 
 My hat's gonna stay on my head, 
 but I'll handle it. 
 Okay, Jack. 
 You know that little bump 
 behind your ear? 
 We have to poke it with something sharp, 
 which will hurt, but we have to do it 
 so hopefully you can get a new heart. 
 But Mr. Snugglepuff is here 
 to keep you company. 
 Asher said the taco truck 
 added chorizo to the menu, 
 and it's bussin'. 
 The next late night, 
 we should share an order. 
 Not really my thing. Thanks. 
 The sheet papoose is secure. 
 Good. Dr. Kalu, cradle the baby. 
 Dr. Allen, sterilize 
 the area behind the ear. 
 Okay, baby, don't look. 
 His eyes are not yet able to 
 focus beyond 8 to 12 inches. 
 The abscess is pretty deep. 
 It may take a while to heal. 
 What about a wound vac? 
 We don't have one small enough. 
 It's okay. 
 Maggots. 
 How are those better than 
 just using antibiotics? 
 Maggots work faster to 
 clear necrotic debris 
 on account of the antimicrobial nature 
 of their saliva and 
 other digestive secretions. 
 It's safe to put those bugs on my baby? 
 - Larvae. 
 - These are medical maggots. 
 They've been specially disinfected. 
 It's completely safe. 
 I would use maggots on my son, 
 Steve, in this situation. 
 That is unlikely to happen, 
 but I hope the parallel 
 puts you at ease. 
 Go ahead. 
 Hm! 
 You want some coffee? 
 Or I have a stash of 
 protein bars in my office. 
 I'm fine, thanks. 
 But if you want something, go ahead. 
 What's your family here for? 
 A heart transplant, hopefully, 
 for our son, Jack. 
 How old is he? 
 Oh. My daughter, Eden, is 11 weeks. 
 She's having heart surgery right now. 
 Y'all will be in my prayers. 
 Is this Jack's first surgery? 
 He's had other procedures, 
 but this would be his first 
 open heart surgery. 
 If it happens. 
 When 
 it happens, I recommend 
 Biafine cream for post-op. 
 It contains a natural compound 
 called trolamine. 
 It really helped with Eden's recovery. 
 How many surgeries 
 has your daughter had? 
 Uh, one. At seven weeks. 
 Hmm. 
 Eden and I are old hands. 
 You're two very resilient ladies. 
 I'm Kate Pierce. 
 This is my husband, Owen. 
 Morgan Reznick. 
 Alex Park. 
 Would you like to... 
 Yeah! You can do it! Come on. 
 Oh! There you go! 
 You got it! You got it! 
 You got it! 
 Hi, Daddy. How is it being back at work? 
 I just applied maggots to a baby 
 a few months older than Steve. 
 Is that Steve? 
 He is supposed to be asleep. 
 Mm. He's doing well 
 with tummy time. 
 And you mentioned yesterday 
 he was behind, 
 so I thought I'd add 
 a few extra minutes. 
 No, no. 
 Tummy time should not be 
 extended into his sleep window. 
 Did you not get the app alert? 
 You are seven minutes 
 into nap time. 
 Nope. I guess I missed it. 
 Delaying his nap could 
 make him overtired 
 or delay his next feeding. 
 The schedule is very important. 
 I know, Shaun, I know. It's just 
 a few extra minutes. 
 Eight minutes. That is not 
 a few. It is several. 
 Uh, I should go put Steve down. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Okay. 
 Oh. 
 We had to abort the procedure. 
 Eden has a bicuspid pulmonary valve. 
 There wasn't enough tissue 
 to attach it to the aorta. 
 And we observed leaking at the valve. 
 Her heart is failing 
 even faster than we thought. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 What's our next move? 
 Oh. The maggots worked! 
 Baby Jack's infection has cleared, 
 and the heart is on its way here. 
 Eden has two bad valves 
 and rapidly progressing heart failure. 
 We have one donor heart 
 and two babies who need it. 
 It's up to us to decide 
 which baby gets this heart. 
 Jack has been waiting for three months. 
 A transplant is his only option. 
 He could go on a V.A.D. until 
 another heart is available. 
 That could take months. 
 And a V.A.D. isn't a good option 
 for Jack because of the... 
 Morgan. Morgan. 
 You can't be here. Neither of you. 
 I can't be anywhere else, 
 so either someone should sedate me or... 
 Well, that can be arranged. 
 It's only a problem 
 that Park and I are here 
 if we influence your decision, 
 so don't let us. 
 I won't say a word. 
 Dr. Kalu? 
 Yeah, um... 
 as far as the V.A.D. for Jack, 
 he's underweight, 
 so a high risk of complications, 
 infections, bleeding, stroke. 
 It's not a great option 
 for Eden, either. 
 Eden can go on ECMO while we're waiting 
 for mechanical replacement valves. 
 ECMO has risks, especially for 
 a baby with Turner syndrome. 
 And the longer she's on it, 
 the greater the risk 
 of serious complications. 
 The valves may not get here in time. 
 Care to weigh in, Dr. Murphy? 
 Jack and Eden are equally 
 good matches to the donor heart 
 based on size and blood type. 
 Anything else? 
 It's okay, Shaun. 
 Without this heart... 
 Jack will die. 
 Eden may also die without it. 
 But she has other options. 
 They are risky, but they are options. 
 Jack should get the heart. 
 We'll put Eden on ECMO tonight. 
 And I'll contact Abbott about 
 getting the 15-millimeter valves ASAP. 
 Hey. I'm sorry. 
 Can we rain-check tonight? 
 I'm exhausted, and Jerome promised 
 that we could watch 
 a nice crime procedural. 
 Sometimes you need a case of the week. 
 Yeah. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Mmm! My favorite! 
 One cheddar brisket with mild sauce 
 so little Steve's next meal 
 doesn't burn his mouth. 
 You are a treasure. I am starving. 
 Thank you. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Poor Eden, having to go on ECMO. 
 And poor Morgan and Park. 
 It's... been a day. 
 And how are you holding up? 
 Without Perez? 
 Everything that happens, 
 at home or at work, 
 he's the first person I want to tell. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 And I can't. 
 Or I shouldn't. 
 I really miss him. 
 You can tell 
 me 
 everything. 
 If it's too surgical, 
 I may not understand it, 
 but I am excellent at nodding 
 and acting interested. 
 Mm! 
 I'm here for you. So is Asher. 
 What's going on? Tell me. 
 Babies are terrible at gossip. 
 Asher and I were supposed 
 to hang out tonight, 
 just the two of us. 
 Do you need to check on him? 
 No. If he smells me, 
 I'll never get out of there. 
 He'll settle back down. 
 So you and Asher had plans... 
 He blew me off... for Jerome... 
 because he had a hard day 
 on Eden's case, which I get, 
 but I had a hard day, too. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Steve's not settling. 
 Well, he can wait a minute. 
 You had a hard day, too? 
 It... It just seems like 
 everybody has someone except... 
 Go. 
 I am so sorry. I-I will be right back. 
 I swear. 
 Mm. 
 You didn't have to do this, Shaun. 
 I am more thorough than 
 anyone else in this hospital. 
 Starting ECMO. 
 I just got an e-mail 
 from Gail on the Board. 
 I'm suddenly a top candidate 
 for Interim President? 
 You're welcome. 
 I don't want that job. 
 It's bet... better you than O'Brien. 
 You're a good manager, you're... 
 you're well-respected, 
 and, you know, as a diverse woman... 
 People aren't diverse. 
 I'm part of an underrepresented group. 
 Right. That. 
 Makes you an ideal candidate. 
 Look. Gail loved the idea. 
 I hate you. You're welcome. 
 Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. 
 I am glad to see you, Steve, 
 but you are not supposed to be awake. 
 Yeah, I-I fell asleep 
 during his afternoon nap. 
 We didn't wake up until 4:30. 
 You need to set an alarm. 
 The schedule is very important. 
 I know. I know. 
 Tomorrow I am doing a heart transplant 
 on a 12-week-old baby. 
 Okay. You need sleep. 
 Yes, I do. 
 Go to bed. I'll handle Steve tonight. 
 I-I don't think I can. 
 Shh, it's okay. What about your 
 noise-canceling headphones? 
 I fall asleep on my side. 
 I cannot do that in those. 
 Maybe you could go spend 
 the night at Glassman's? 
 No. 
 What about your office? 
 Can you sleep there? 
 We can save them both with one heart. 
 It's called a Domino Transplant. 
 Jack's heart is failing, 
 but his valves are healthy, 
 so when Jack receives the donor heart, 
 we will use his valves to 
 replace Eden's damaged ones. 
 A fresh h*m* donor means 
 Eden won't need 
 multiple surgeries or blood thinners. 
 One heart could save both babies. 
 What are the chances of valve failure? 
 Minimal. Jack's valves 
 are very functional 
 despite his cardiomyopathy. 
 The odds of success are high. 
 It's the best option we have... 
 for Eden. 
 And for Jack? 
 We would have to be very careful 
 while removing his heart 
 so as not to damage his valves. 
 That would mean more time on bypass, 
 which means a greater risk 
 of bleeding or infection. 
 It's a lot to ask. 
 They can always say no. 
 What would 
 you 
 say? 
 You haven't eaten anything in 24 hours. 
 I'm fine. 
 No matter what they decide, 
 we'll get through this. 
 Don't. 
 What, try to help? 
 Yes, exactly. 
 It's pointless and annoying. 
 You know, I get that you don't 
 think of Eden as mine yet... 
 and that's why you haven't included me 
 in any of her medical decisions. 
 Not that I need that... 
 or disagree with any of your choices... 
 Is pissing me off another 
 attempt to distract me? 
 I'm not trying to pick a fight. 
 I just want you to know 
 that I love that girl 
 like she's my own, and... 
 I'm as scared as you are. 
 And I wish you'd let me 
 help you because... 
 we're in this together. 
 That's it. 
 And I really don't want you to pass out, 
 so please eat or drink something. 
 If our baby can save your 
 baby's life, we'd be honored. 
 ""I'll love you forever, 
 I'll like you for always. 
 As long as I'm living, 
 my baby you'll be."" 
 Oh, my God. What a tear-jerker. 
 We need to find one of 
 Daddy's medical journals. 
 Reminder... 
 nap time in five minutes. 
 How do I un-sync the baby app 
 from our speaker? 
 Oh, no. You should not do that. 
 I set it up so you can 
 remember the schedule. 
 When it's just me and Steve 
 home during the day, 
 I like to be a little bit more... 
 flexible, go with the flow. 
 I'll just... I'll just unplug it. 
 It has a battery 
 in case of power outages. 
 Lea, when I'm at work, 
 I like knowing what 
 you and Steve are doing. 
 It makes me feel like I am 
 still a part of his day. 
 And when Steve gets off 
 his sleep schedule, 
 I have to go sleep at the hospital, 
 and I miss you both even more. 
 Aw, we missed you, too. 
 How did you sleep? 
 Not well. But I came up 
 with a very good idea 
 to save both babies. 
 I have to go prep for my surgery 
 now. I love you. 
 Dr. Lim, we have a meeting to review... 
 One minute, Shaun. 
 Gail, of course, diversity 
 and representation 
 should be considered, but given this is 
 an interim position, 
 I think the top priority is 
 finding someone who can hit 
 the ground running from day one. 
 And that means someone 
 who's done it before. 
 He's too modest to sing his own praises, 
 but I think he's the obvious choice. 
 Hmm. Compelling argument. 
 - Thank you. 
 - Oh. 
 And seniors are also 
 an underrepresented group. 
 Dr. Murphy and I will start 
 with Jack in OR 1. 
 Asher, you'll be with Eden 
 next door getting her ready. 
 Allen and Kalu, you two 
 will receive the donor heart 
 and prep it for transplant. 
 Then Dr. Lim and I will 
 put Jack on bypass 
 and start cooling him to 25 degrees. 
 Given his age and underlying 
 medical condition, 
 he should not be on bypass 
 for longer than two hours. 
 Putting in Jack's new heart 
 will take about 90 minutes. 
 That leaves us half an hour 
 to remove the old one. 
 While Shaun is transplanting 
 the new heart, 
 I will be excising Jack's valves. 
 We have zero room for error. 
 Prep your patients. 
 Exciting case... 
 Yep. 
 We're saving two babies at once, 
 and your commentary is ""yep""? 
 - I was agreeing with you. 
 - With as few words as possible, 
 which you've been doing 
 for the last two weeks. 
 If you have a problem with me, 
 just tell me. 
 Okay. 
 Okay. I have a problem with you and 
 how you handled Perez's case. 
 - That's completely stupid. 
 - You just said I should tell you. 
 I didn't say I would agree with you. 
 You overrode our patient's wishes, 
 - and Perez is gone because of it. 
 - Perez is 
 alive 
 because of it. 
 You don't know what would have 
 happened if you'd listened to him. 
 You made the decision 
 you thought was best. 
 Didn't matter what anyone else wanted. 
 I'm sorry, but you don't get to do that 
 and not deal with the consequences. 
 The consequences? 
 I lost someone I care about a lot, 
 and I miss him every day. 
 I'm really trying hard to focus 
 on the good things in my life, 
 the job I love, 
 the friends I 
 thought 
 I had... 
 But it feels like everyone is 
 moving on, and I'm just alone. 
 Spare yourself the burden 
 of punishing me. 
 Get her prepped, draped, 
 and under anesthesia. 
 I'll see you in 30 minutes, hopefully. 
 I had an extra set. 
 You don't have to be Catholic. 
 They can just be a reminder 
 that you're not alone. 
 Thank you. 
 There is a lot of 
 scar tissue to dissect through. 
 The cardiomyopathy has caused 
 Jack's heart to enlarge 
 and adhere to his chest wall. 
 This will take longer than planned 
 in order to preserve the valves. 
 We inspected the mitral valve. 
 The atrial septum is intact. 
 The heart looks good. 
 Dr. Allen, connect the pulmonary veins 
 to prep the left atrial cuff. 
 Dr. Kalu, you're with us. 
 Okay. Increase flows 
 and cool to 25 degrees. 
 Start the clock. 
 Come on, Peanut. 
 We went with the flow, 
 but now it's nap time. 
 Come on. Settle. 
 Oh. 
 Ohh! We were so close, Peanut. 
 I need to transect the aorta, 
 but there are thick adhesions 
 where it meets the valve. 
 You now only have an hour and 14 
 minutes to put the new heart in. 
 The annulus is at the tip 
 of my dissection. 
 If I nick that, 
 the aortic valve is useless. 
 Anterior retraction. 
 We're running out of time. 
 Jack's transplant is at serious risk. 
 Metz. 
 Dr. Murphy, you need to 
 abort this procedure. 
 Shaun, ECMO is still an option for Eden. 
 - You need to abort... 
 - Got it! 
 The valves are good. 
 Ready for the donor heart. 
 - How is she? 
 - Ready to go. 
 Vitals are great. 
 Open her chest and start her on bypass 
 while I recover the valves. 
 Scalpel. How do the valves look? 
 A little bigger than 
 we measured on imaging. 
 Makes the anastomosis challenging. 
 But it can still work? 
 It has to. 
 Hm. 
 Feeding time starting 
 in five minutes. 
 Shh. 
 It's not seating perfectly. 
 Let's try a purse string suture. 
 Got it. Saline. 
 There's a paravalvular leak 
 at the aortic. 
 How about pledgeted sutures? 
 In an infant this small, 
 that could cause stenosis. 
 We try again. 
 It's been almost two and a half hours. 
 We need to get him off bypass. 
 The aortic anastomosis is complete. 
 Unclamp the aorta and start rewarming. 
 Now what? 
 We wait... and hope 
 his heart starts beating. 
 It's been almost three hours. 
 Do you think something's wrong? 
 The sutures are holding. 
 Now the little thing just has to beat. 
 Start warming her up. 
 Decrease the flows. 
 We need to shock him. 
 Clear! 
 Again. 
 The surgeries were successful. 
 Both your babies are doing very well, 
 and you can see them soon. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 You saved our daughter. 
 You are welcome. 
 I miss 
 my 
 baby. 
 I'm going home now. 
 Alright. Let me just jump in the shower. 
 And then I'm good to go. 
 Go home to your man. 
 It's okay. 
 Bless you. Tomorrow? 
 Mm-hmm. 
 You're right. This chorizo is... 
 What'd you call it? 
 Bussin'. 
 Right. Definitely bussin'. 
 I thought we could share an order. 
 Tell me you didn't forget the hot sauce. 
 - Hello. 
 - Hm... 
 Why is Steve awake? 
 You look terrible. 
 Thank you. 
 Steve has been fed, burped, changed, 
 and woken from his haphazard nap 
 by a speaker reminder. 
 How's Eden? 
 Very good. And Jack's transplant 
 was successful. 
 Mm. 
 Parenting can be very hard. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah. I've noticed. 
 There are many hard choices 
 about what works best. 
 People want different things. 
 I will try to... 
 ...make room for your way. 
 The schedule is important, 
 but I will un-sync the app 
 from the speaker. 
 I put it out on the fire escape. 
 Thank you. 
 I really appreciate it. 
 But the only room I need 
 right now is the bedroom. 
 - Okay. 
 - Good night. 
 I'm borrowing your 
 noise-canceling headphones. 
 I love you both. 
 Are you kidding me? 
 You recommended 
 me?! 
 I was just following your example. 
 See? You're a natural leader. 
 I'm old. I'm worn out and I'm old. 
 - You're 
 wise. 
 - I remember rotary phones. 
 You're vital. You're experienced. 
 You're the most respected doctor 
 in this hospital. 
 Aaron, you have institutional knowledge 
 and a... and a natural, 
 unexplainable gravitas. 
 Will you please stop being 
 an idiot and just take the job? 
 Stop being selfish and stubborn. 
 How am I being selfish? I'm... 
 Oh, you're together. 
 That saves me a stop. 
 Your recommendations presented the Board 
 with a very difficult choice. 
 So we didn't... 
 choose. 
 You two are the new 
 Interim Co-Presidents 
 of St. Bonaventure Hospital. 
 Congratulations! 
 This is not the schedule, Steve. 
 Mommy needs to sleep. 
 Daddy needs to sleep. 
 You need to sleep. 
 Please? 
 Please. We are both very tired. 
 Please. We are both very tired. 
 Hey. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I can't go inside because 
 Lea needs to sleep. 
 I've always been able 
 to get him down before. 
 Sometimes babies just need to cry. 
 Hey. Um... 
 why don't I take him? 
 Get some sleep. 
 It's okay. Just get some rest. 
 I will just take a short nap. 
 Take as long as you need. 
 Hey. 
 Hey. I got you. 
 Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
 I got you. Huh. I got you. 
 I'm Grandpa... 
 in case you were wondering."
,6470478,7,2,"Grasp is good, 
 but Steve's not gaining weight 
 quite as quickly as I'd like. 
 I'm feeding him every two 
 to three hours during the day, 
 every three to four at night. 
 And pumping in between 
 to increase milk production. 
 Well, I'm going to recommend 
 you start supplementing with formula. 
 But everyone says ""breast is best""? 
 [DR. HYLAND] Breast milk is the ideal. 
 Right now, Steve just 
 needs a little extra. 
 Some samples to get you started. 
 This is an excellent product, 
 and it will make it easier for me 
 to do more nighttime feedings. 
 Yeah. Yeah. 
 I thought being co-presidents 
 meant we would 
 do things 
 together. 
 I was aiming for... 
 you do some things and I do some things. 
 Funny how your ""some things"" 
 leads to more work for 
 me. 
 I have no idea 
 what you're talking about. 
 [SCOFFS] The affiliation deal 
 with San Jose Med School? 
 We had to cover the overages 
 because the nurses unionized. 
 In exchange, we teach 
 a few med students. 
 [SCOFFS] You won't be teaching anyone. 
 I 
 will have the useless baby docs 
 wandering around the department 
 - like lost children with scalpels. 
 - [ELEVATOR DINGS] 
 We made a good deal. That's it. 
 It's a good deal. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC] 
 [JARED] We should go 
 introduce ourselves. 
 No, they are baby ducklings, 
 and I will not be their mommy. 
 Let them imprint on Shaun and Park. 
 Hi! 
 Bye. 
 [DR. PARK] Hi, I'm Dr. Park. 
 This is Doctor... 
 Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I... I can't believe it's really you. 
 I'm just so excited, 
 I'm about to pee myself. 
 Please do not. 
 Of course not. 
 You're... You're not a shaker. 
 There was a March 2012 abstract 
 that demonstrated 
 a reluctance to shake hands 
 could be used as a diagnostic 
 marker for ASD. 
 But I love a good, firm grip. 
 That's why they call it a spectrum. 
 We could shake. 
 That's not very firm. 
 Okay. That's better. 
 I'm Charlotte Lukaitis. 
 Nice to meet you, Charlotte. 
 I go by ""Charlie"" for now, 
 ""Dr. Lukaitis"" soon. 
 Only two years away from my goal, 
 which I've had since I was 17, 
 ever since I saw that 
 viral video of you saving 
 that boy at the San Jose Airport 
 using a homemade one-way valve. 
 It was the coolest, most heroic thing 
 I've ever seen from a person with ASD. 
 It was very heroic. 
 I picked San Jose for medical school 
 hoping to engineer a run-in with you, 
 but then your hospital 
 partnered with my school, 
 and it's like what Taylor Swift 
 says in ""Mastermind""... 
 - [WHISPERS] Charlie. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 Dom helps me when I, 
 you know, talk too much. 
 [NORMAL VOICE] Hi, I'm Dominick Hubank. 
 And we're happy to have such 
 eager future doctors joining the team. 
 Future surgeon. 
 I don't want to be a surgeon, 
 but I'm excited for the rotation. 
 Okay. 
 Charlie, you are on my team. 
 [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Yes! 
 Would you like to present? 
 I'd love to. 
 - Richard Shelford, 53... 
 - Call me Rich. 
 Not that I'm wealthy. 
 Right, Rich Shelford, 53 years old... 
 Don't feel a day over 52. 
 - That's funny. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 Okay. This is taking too long. 
 Please tell us what happened. 
 He was coughing so hard 
 he couldn't catch his breath, 
 and then he fainted and hit his head. 
 Cough syncope. 
 He's thinner and way more tired 
 than the last time he visited me. 
 Yeah, but I'm fine. 
 It's just a little cold. 
 You could barely breathe, Dad. 
 Um, chest X-ray shows 
 multiple lung nodules 
 and enlarged lymph nodes in 
 the hilar and mediastinal areas. 
 Get an ABG, CBC, perform a bronchoscopy, 
 and send biopsies to path. 
 Can you apply a wound dressing 
 using the Turban Technique? 
 I sure can. 
 [COUGHS] 
 Hey, uh... [CLEARS THROAT] 
 how long until we could get out of here? 
 My daughter, she took some time 
 off work to show me around. 
 She's got her own business. 
 Works as a tech consultant for a 
 few companies around the Valley. 
 - Dad. 
 - Let the man brag. 
 - It's every proud father's right. 
 - Yeah. 
 - Hold this, please. 
 - Oh. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 [MAN] 
 Basic Turban Technique 
 for head bandaging. 
 Step one, tie the ends of two 
 bandages together in a knot. 
 Step two, 
 starting from one ear... 
 The patient was a good sport about it, 
 but his daughter was not happy. 
 A wound dressing is very low stakes. 
 Did Charlie do a bad job 
 following the tutorial? 
 Uh, no. Actually, the dressing 
 was pretty decent. 
 But the point is, the patient's 
 family were uncomfortable. 
 I think someone should tell her 
 no more how-to videos 
 in front of patients. 
 Oh. You can if you want. 
 We were able to repair 
 your skull fracture 
 and evacuate a large subdural hematoma. 
 Lucky day. Is there a Wi-Fi password? 
 I need to get League Pass in here. 
 Uh, the accident report says 
 that you stepped right 
 in front of an oncoming car. 
 I just didn't see it. 
 Big day today. 
 I got the Clips and the points, 
 the money line, and the over. 
 And it's the last leg 
 of a six-team parlay 
 that I 
 need 
 to come through. 
 That's a lot of action. 
 Well, having some skin in 
 the game makes life more fun. 
 Hey, you're The Dominator. 
 Uh, just ""Dom"" now. 
 My football days are behind me. 
 That pancake block you had 
 against Stanford? 
 Cleared the way for that 75-yard run? 
 Made me 10 grand, that one play! 
 Why aren't you in the league? 
 Decided I wanted to help people 
 instead of hurt them. 
 Okay, let's draw blood 
 for post-op hematocrit. 
 Once the brain swelling 
 comes down, you can go. 
 Have you done a blood draw yet? 
 It's my first day out of the classroom. 
 Five bucks he gets an A. 
 No. 
 [CELL PHONE CHIMING] 
 All right. You're going 
 to palpate for a vein. 
 Oh, and remember, 
 when introducing the needle, 
 always bevel up and insert 
 the tube into the vacutainer. 
 And you just passed phlebotomy 101. 
 Oh, God. 
 [THUD] 
 You could be up five right now. 
 [LAUGHING] He went down. 
 I mean, hard. 
 Frontal and parietal lobes look clear. 
 [DOM SIGHS] 
 I'm sorry. 
 I did deadlifts and squats this morning. 
 Didn't have time to eat breakfast. 
 Feeling okay now? 
 My ego took a hit, but I'll be okay. 
 Whoa! 
 Is that our patient's brain? 
 Mm. You just passed anatomy 101. 
 [CHUCKLES] Which part's the front? 
 Oh, spoke too soon. 
 This is the axial plane, 
 which means we're 
 looking down from the top. 
 [COMPUTER BEEPS] 
 These are the temporal and 
 occipital lobes here. Also clear. 
 How can you tell? 
 We injected gadolinium, which leaks out 
 around the areas of injury 
 and makes them show up 
 brighter on the scan. 
 Like that? 
 Yeah. Like that. 
 That's a tumor, 
 completely interwoven 
 with his brain stem 
 and cranial nerves 
 and extending to his upper spinal cord. 
 I guess we know 
 why he didn't see that car.

 Onto the bronchi and bronchioles.

 Look at the patches 
 on the bronchial mucosa. 
 [JARED] There's a luminal narrowing 
 from the enlarged lymph nodes. 
 This definitely isn't pneumonia. 
 [CHARLIE] Cool. 
 My first medical mystery. 
 Can I page Dr. Murphy? 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC] 
 Did you ever cut quartz countertops? 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Yeah. 
 I started off in a fabrication shop. 
 How'd you know that? 
 Cutting quartz produces 
 toxic fine-dust particles 
 that have embedded 
 in your airway and lungs. 
 You have silicosis. 
 It's like watching a magic trick. 
 Uh, my doc said it was 
 just a recurring pneumonia. 
 Silicosis can often be 
 misdiagnosed until it's too late. 
 You will need 
 a bilateral lung transplant. 
 He needs new lungs? 
 Yes. With your declining 
 respiratory function 
 and extensive damage, 
 you should be prioritized 
 for transplant. 
 But you will need full-time 
 home care for the rest of your life. 
 But I live alone back in Florida. 
 Dad, one step at a time. 
 I think you should get the surgery here, 
 then move in with me. 
 I can't do that. 
 Of course you can. 
 Your career has just taken off. 
 I'm not gonna burden you. 
 It's not a burden. You're my dad. 
 You peeled my oranges 
 and coached my soccer team. 
 Then you put me through college 
 and business school. 
 Let me take care of you. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Someone raised his girl right. 
 [SHAUN] Okay. 
 We will call a transplant coordinator. 
 Where's Steve? 
 Down the hall, flirting with the nurses. 
 I need you to write me 
 a prescription for domperidone. 
 It increases breast milk production. 
 All the mom message boards say so. 
 It is not approved 
 as a lactation aid anywhere. 
 Doctors in Canada and Mexico 
 are using it off-label. 
 Does Steve not like the formula 
 Dr. Hyland recommended? 
 I 
 don't like it, Shaun. 
 I feel like... I feel 
 like a failure as a mom. 
 But you are not a failure. 
 You are following 
 all the recommended guidelines. 
 In fact, the only guideline 
 you're not following 
 is supplementing 
 with formula as advised. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Shaun... 
 I've been wanting 
 to be a mom for so long, 
 and part of that is my body 
 is supposed to give Steve 
 everything he needs, and mine won't. 
 And I hate it. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 Come in. 
 Good. You're both here. 
 An invite to Baby Eden's Sip and See. 
 So everyone can officially meet her 
 in a cute dress 
 instead of a hospital gown. 
 Is Dr. Glassman going? 
 - I think so. 
 - Then I do not want to go. 
 I thought you and Glassy 
 had worked things out. 
 He took Steve the other night. 
 [SHAUN] Hmm. 
 Who cares if he's there? 
 As long as you 
 and that gorgeous baby make it. 
 Wouldn't miss it. 
 Isn't being a mom great? 
 The greatest. 
 You just said you feel like a failure. 
 I think that is because 
 of a postpartum decrease 
 in estrogen and progesterone. 
 Did you just call me hormonal? 
 - No, actually reduced hormonal. 
 - Okay, Shaun. 
 - Time to go. 
 - This is my office. 
 Let's not have it be your gravesite. 
 Huh. There's gotta be 
 something you can do. 
 We can't safely remove the tumor 
 without permanent injury 
 to your brain stem. 
 If you survive the surgery at all. 
 I'm sorry. I know it's a lot to take in. 
 But there's... there's new 
 technology all the time. 
 Nadal's back with the stem cells, 
 and Bartolo Colon... 
 Experimental treatments on 
 athletes' orthopedic injuries 
 are completely different 
 than brain surgery. 
 C-Could you remove some of the tumor? 
 Buy me more time? How about chemo? 
 This type of cancer 
 doesn't respond to chemo. 
 We did read a paper in class 
 about a TCR approach. 
 Could that be something? 
 That was only done a few times, 
 and never with brain stem involvement. 
 TCR. 
 It's my new favorite letters. 
 Whatever they stand for, let's do that. 
 TCR means we would 
 saw up through your mandible 
 and dislocate your lower jaw. 
 Then we cut open 
 from the roof of your mouth 
 to the back of your throat. 
 That's just to access the tumor. 
 That tumor is woven 
 into your brain stem. 
 Removing it would very likely 
 leave you quadriplegic, 
 unable to speak or move, 
 if 
 you survive the surgery. 
 Okay. 
 Maybe it's not my favorite. 
 But let's try. 
 Sal, you should enjoy 
 your remaining time. 
 Travel. 
 Connect with family. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Who am I gonna connect with? 
 Wife kicked me out when I gambled away 
 the kids' college fund. 
 None of them 
 have talked to me for years. 
 I got a break coming my way. 
 I can feel it. 
 We've got our annual presentation 
 to the managed care companies. 
 They want detailed reports 
 on patient outcomes 
 for diabetes, geriatrics... 
 That's great. Schedule that for never. 
 - No, I've set it for tomorrow at 9:00. 
 - That's the wrong answer. 
 Unfortunately, I have 
 back-to-back surgeries. 
 Thank goodness I have a partner 
 to do the things I can't.

 Kind of busy right now. 
 Can we talk upstairs later? 
 What are you doing? 
 Just talking to a friend. 
 You called him ""Daddy,"" 
 but your dad's upstairs. 
 [SCOFFS] He's a client, a regular. 
 He paid me five grand 
 for a last-minute session. 
 Lucky for me, he's into exhibitionism. 
 Five grand? That's more than I 
 made a whole month waitressing, 
 including tips. 
 Do people tip sex workers? 
 Charlie, this isn't 
 any of our business, so... 
 Plenty of people know what I do. 
 Just not my actual father. 
 Please, you cannot say anything to him. 
 - Of course not. 
 - [CELL PHONE DINGS] 
 Ah. Good news. 
 Donor lungs just became available. 
 ""Happy birthday, Daddy,"" indeed. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC] 
 The donor's upstairs on life support. 
 His family is ready to withdraw care. 
 We'll take you 
 for some additional testing, 
 but the transplant could happen 
 as soon as tomorrow. 
 - [RICH] Wow. 
 - You'll need a bedroom 
 on the ground floor, 
 and an easily accessible bathroom. 
 I can convert my office. 
 As long as you have privacy 
 elsewhere for your 
 work. 
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. [CHUCKLES] 
 Why'd you say ""work"" like that? 
 I mean, how much privacy do you 
 need for tech consultations? 
 Charlie's speech pattern 
 can be a bit unusual. 
 Her autism is awesome. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't mention it. Really. Do not. 
 Love you, Daddy. 
 So many daddies, so little time. 
 Whoa, whoa. 
 What does that mean? 
 Uh, Dad, nothing. 
 I'm not asking you. I'm asking her. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Saying ""observe"" isn't enough. 
 You need to tell them, ""Don't speak."" 
 I realize that now. 
 So does The Dominator. 
 What are your thoughts about the TCR? 
 You're considering the surgery? 
 It's either that or do nothing 
 and Sal is dead in a year. 
 A year is a year. 
 You're not his executioner. 
 So you wouldn't do it? 
 No, I'm not making 
 this decision for you. 
 You're an attending now. 
 Your surgery, your call. 
 [CLATTERING] 
 What are you doing? 
 Work order says deliver them here. 
 Signed by the president. 
 Co... president. 
 [JARED] Once Rich's questions 
 picked up speed, 
 it wasn't long before 
 Charlie mentioned ""sex worker."" 
 Shortly thereafter, he banned Grace from 
 the room 
 and called off the surgery. 
 Okay. 
 His oxygen saturation is decreasing. 
 He is profoundly hypoxic. 
 Rich needs new lungs now. 
 I told him that. 
 He booked a flight back to Florida. 
 Said he'll get 
 on the transplant list there. 
 No, no, no. His lungs 
 cannot handle transport. 
 Charlie's mistake is 
 endangering our patient's health. 
 Our patient is doing that 
 all on his own. 
 But Rich would not be upset 
 if Charlie had not revealed... 
 She didn't violate any HIPAA laws. 
 The only thing she did wrong 
 was not keep Grace's 
 secret life a secret. 
 Which kind of sounds like 
 something you might have done 
 back in your first year. 
 [SHAUN] Hmm. 
 Our patient needs a bilateral 
 whole-lung lavage 
 in order to get home safely. 
 Please get his consent. 
 Charlie can do scut work. 
 [DR. PARK] Dissecting the tumor

 Again. 
 [DEVICE BEEPING] 
 Have you eaten? 
 Two double cheeseburgers, 
 fries, coleslaw, cottage cheese, 
 a pudding, and fruit salad. 
 You know, hemophobia can make 
 for a pretty rough surgical rotation. 
 You got any idea how to get over it? 
 I gotta. 
 [CHUCKLES] My brother and I, 
 we have this deal 
 to become family docs, 
 then move back home. 
 When our mother got sick, 
 we saw how lousy medical care can get. 
 You could try exposure therapy, 
 watch a few hours of blood draws.

 - Ooh, there's a twist. 
 You good? 
 Okay. Just breathe.

 Shaun 
 doesn't 
 like her? 
 But she worships him. 
 Charlie blabbed to the patient, 
 blew up his double lung transplant. 
 Double lumen 
 endotracheal tubes and clamps. 
 My guy did the same thing, 
 but in reverse. 
 Mentioned a virtually 
 impossible surgery. 
 Now the patient wants it. 
 [CHUCKLING] I think I actually saw 
 smoke come out of Park's ears. 
 Well, 20% of med school 
 students don't make it, 
 and most of that happens 
 during surgical rotation. 
 I wonder which one 
 of our ducklings goes first? 
 Ten bags of saline. 
 Oh, you're gonna need a cart. 
 The big guy's on a mission. 
 I'll take the girl. 
 [GASPS] I've never said 
 those words before. 
 Done with my scut work. 
 You guys need a cart. 
 I'll be right back. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC] 
 Hey. 
 Are you not going to go to Morgan's 
 baby thing 
 because I might be there? 
 Yes. 
 Well, that's pretty dumb. 
 Don't you think it's time 
 we moved past this stuff? 
 No. 
 Well, I'm trying to. 
 I'm the one who should be mad at you. 
 You should have met Steve 
 on the day he was born. 
 Yes. I should have. 
 I should have done that. 
 I was pretty upset back then. 
 You humiliated me, 
 and I'm not a surgeon now 
 partly because of you. 
 Did you forget that? 
 That is not an apology. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Drained ninth liter of effluent. 
 Left lung output is looking clearer. 
 [OVER INTERCOM] 
 Did everyone 
 look at Grace's cam-girl site? 
 What is she doing here? 
 She was done with scut work. 
 Infusing another liter of saline. 
 Grace put herself online 
 because she wants customers. 
 I'm giving her what she wants. 
 You actually subscribed? 
 I am a feminist, 
 and she's very beautiful. 
 Her site offers 
 tasteful nude portraits, 
 sensual shower videos, 
 and gritty bondage. 
 No amount of money 
 is worth selling your body. 
 Uh, $3.6 million a year might be. 
 What about you, Dr. Murphy? 
 How would you feel if your son 
 ended up doing sex work? 
 What if he ends up sick 
 from cutting quartz countertops 
 for a living? 
 We can clear Rich to fly home. 
 But I need to talk to him first. 
 [FOOTSTEPS IN DISTANCE] 
 How long ago did she wake up? 
 About an hour or so. I just fed her. 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 The patient wants to go for it, 
 and there's a non-zero chance it works. 
 So do it. 
 Only the best of the best 
 could pull this off. 
 And what if that's you? 
 I've been in the OR with you. 
 I know your steadiness, 
 your precision, your persistence. 
 I believe you can do this. 
 [EDEN BABBLING] 
 Maybe Eden should decide. 
 She agrees with her mama. 
 [BABBLING CONTINUES] 
 [CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES] 
 [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 You are able to fly home now. 
 But you should listen to your daughter. 
 Dad. 
 Please. 
 Dr. Murphy says it's very unlikely 
 they'll find another donor 
 match before you die. 
 Take the lungs. 
 You don't have to live with me. 
 I'll find a place for you. 
 You have to stop what you're doing. 
 No. 
 I like what I do. 
 I'm successful, 
 and I'm not hurting anyone. 
 You're hurting me. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 My son, Steve, is three weeks old. 
 I have been thinking about what 
 he might do when he gets older 
 that I would not approve of. 
 But I can't imagine 
 not wanting him in my life 
 unless he was cruel or unkind to others. 
 She is kind and generous. 
 She loves you and wants to care for you. 
 She seems like a very good person. 
 You did raise Grace right. 
 You're a gambling addict 
 who showed up here 
 having already thrown everything away. 
 The only way I do this surgery 
 is if I know you'll make 
 better use of the extra time. 
 - This doesn't seem ethical. 
 - It's not. 
 Convince me you'll 
 lead a life worth saving. 
 My name is Sal Zacharia, 
 and I have a gambling addiction. 
 I promise I will get treatment. 
 And you'll reach out to your ex-wife, 
 try to reconnect with your family. 
 How is this any business of yours? 
 Tell me why I should believe you. 
 Because I die if you don't. 
 I don't wanna die. 
 Let's get prepped for surgery. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Scrub your arms to three 
 inches above the elbow. 
 How did you get Rich to change his mind? 
 Did you trick him? 
 I related to him as a father. 
 I have become very good 
 at displaying empathy. 
 Neurotypicals are weird. 
 Yes, they are. 
 Rinse your hands and arms 
 from fingertips to elbows, 
 one direction only. 
 I am displaying empathy now, 
 by allowing you into the OR. 
 You should be grateful 
 I was able to fix the case. 
 Hands up, and don't touch anything. 
 [CHARLIE] My first time 
 being gowned and gloved. 
 Do we get to shave his chest? 
 [NURSE VILLANUEVA] 
 It was done in pre-op. 
 Oh, I shave my own body hair, 
 so I'm great at it. 
 Not my chest, though. 
 - I mean, my underarms, my legs, my... 
 - [JARED] Charlie. 
 [SHAUN] Okay. Please stop talking. 
 [CHARLIE] I... I, uh, 
 was just trying to... 
 [SHAUN] You cannot touch your skin. 
 [CHARLIE] I didn't, 
 I touched my earring. 
 [SHAUN] You can't touch 
 any non-sterile item. 
 You've just contaminated 
 the surgical field. 
 You have to re-scrub in, 
 and we have to re-drape everything. 
 - You're speaking very loudly. 
 - Go read the literature 
 on operating-room sterile technique. 
 That won't help. 
 I'm an auditory learner. 
 You need to leave. 
 Okay? Leave now. 
 [JARED SIGHS] 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 That looks fun. 
 [BREAST PUMP WHIRRING] 
 Why did you e-mail ""Will not attend""? 
 You're clearly skipping my baby's party 
 because you feel 
 like a failure as a mom. 
 But you're not. And that's stupid. 
 And how can I help 
 if you won't just tell me 
 that you're having 
 breastfeeding problems? 
 Mm. I'm sorry. 
 I feel like a jerk complaining 
 to you about all of this. 
 I know I'm lucky to breastfeed at all, 
 and I am not being rational. 
 You're not the only one failing. 
 When Eden cries during the night, 
 Alex is the one who wakes up. 
 Every time. 
 During one of his overnight shifts, 
 I slept through my own baby 
 crying for almost 20 minutes. 
 I mean, that's actual neglect. 
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure Child 
 Protective Services is downstairs. 
 Shut up, raisin boobs. 
 [LAUGHS] Mm. 
 You are the greatest mom. 
 Adopting a baby with Turner syndrome, 
 caring for her 
 after two heart surgeries, 
 and somehow throwing a party 
 while being so put together. 
 And I use formula exclusively. 
 Finally got the last box 
 removed from my office. 
 - Space is a little tight. 
 - And yet, I found some. 
 Well, that's excellent use 
 of your co-presidential powers. 
 - I owe you. 
 - Oh, my God, can we please stop? 
 Can we... Can we just have a truce? 
 - I'll think about it. 
 - Please? 
 I promise, from here on in, 
 I will check in with all the big stuff. 
 Okay? 
 No more gotchas. 
 [ALL] Happy birthday! 
 I sent the memo out this morning. 
 Eighty? 
 You look really good for your age. 
 [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] 
 I got booted out of my first surgery 
 for contaminating the sterile field. 
 I'm probably about to join you. 
 I fainted twice at the sight of blood. 
 I'm already sweating 
 and seeing little black dots. 
 - What? 
 - Feel better? 
 That activated your sympathetic 
 nervous system. 
 More blood flow means you won't faint. 
 Too bad I can't do that to myself.

 You know, I...

 If the offer still stands. 
 Of course it does. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. 
 [SMOOCHES] 
 You're a good person. 
 [INHALES, EXHALES DEEPLY] 
 Hello. 
 I would like a report 
 on what you've learned 
 from the sterile techniques manual. 
 I'll e-mail it. 
 I'm reorganizing for peak efficiency. 
 Making a great day greater. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 No. Excuse me. 
 Today was not a great day. 
 Nor was yesterday. 
 You made several big mistakes 
 and dozens of small ones. 
 My anatomy professor told us 
 it's okay to make mistakes. 
 That's how we learn. 
 Your professor is wrong. 
 And so is this re-organization. 
 I had everything in the proper place. 
 Restore it, then go home. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 [CELL PHONE CLICKING] 
 [SIGHS] Looks like we both

 Hmm.

 You're not my hero.

 Because we've had a long couple of days

 I was doing patient intake,

 with her mammograms. 
 It was a follow-up 
 to a double mastectomy. 
 [STIFLED LAUGHTER]

 Mine was obstetrics. 
 It was my first delivery,

 and I said, ""Ew,"" like, out loud.

 Why won't you let us sleep? 
 We shouldn't curse in front of him. 
 We didn't. 
 And he's obviously gonna be a rock star. 
 So might as well get used

 He screams like Axl Rose.

 Crying uses the vocal-fold muscles 
 very differently than singing. 
 And lots of jobs work at night. 
 Janitors, truck drivers,

 I'm sorry. 
 I just don't get what the big deal is. 
 I've never even met your niece. 
 Yeah, because you've turned down 
 every invite to a family gathering. 
 Okay. I've just been really busy lately. 
 Last time my brother had a barbecue, 
 you went to a karaoke bar 
 with Jordan instead. 
 That is not true.

 I've gone out of my way to be 
 sensitive to your family history. 
 Mine is different. 
 We're all super close. 
 And... And this is a big deal. 
 It's her confirmation. 
 I'm not asking you to go to the

 I can't tomorrow night. 
 I have a ton of work

 It smells like a brewery in here. 
 Sorry. We had a party

 Um, I was gonna shower, 
 but my roommates, 
 they insisted I go 
 to the ER immediately. 
 I-I can't hear out of my left ear. 
 When did you lose... 
 Miss Lukaitis is 
 one of our med students. 
 She is here to observe. 
 Med students 
 do not take patient histories 
 unless directed to. 
 I wasn't taking a history. 
 I see you got into a fight last night? 
 No. It was... It was a drinking game. 
 You take turns slapping 
 each other in the face 
 and whoever flinches, 
 they have to drink. 
 - Sounds fun. 
 - Yeah. 
 I woke up with an insane headache. 
 I think I ruptured my eardrum. 
 I slapped my friend the other 
 day to treat his hemophobia. 
 It seemed safe, 
 but I'm probably not as strong... 
 There's bilateral otitis externa 
 and significant cerumen blockage. 
 Cerumen? [CHUCKLES] 
 Yeah, you have an ear infection 
 and a lot of earwax. 
 Oh. 
 Whoa. What happened here? 
 [JARED] Ooh. 
 Oh, it's nothing. It's just a bruise. 
 Take more than a slap to cause that. 
 One of the guys in my fraternity 
 has one of those foam-round shotguns 
 that the police use for riot control. 
 Um, so we were testing it out 
 on each other. 
 - [ASHER] Mm. 
 - [SHAUN] Mm. 
 Flush the ears with warm saline 
 and administer polymyxin B drops. 
 Then get X-rays 
 to rule out a broken rib. 
 You can go with them. 
 I'd rather continue to shadow you. 
 I already know how 
 to clear out earwax and... 
 Go with them.

 And I'll talk to Shaun about it tonight. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 [SIGHS] I'm sorry.

 I was a cop for 15 years

 It'll become just part of the routine. 
 I just got to get through this rotation. 
 Hey, if you want to sit

 You can hit the skills lab, 
 practice suturing. 
 Before I went to med school, 
 I was a D-1 tackle.

 it's better to give than to receive,

 Oh, might as well add a putting green

 I work better with a pool table. 
 Great. 
 The board had a list of issues

 and since I 
 actually

 He's a moron. 
 When I'm fantasizing about him tonight, 
 I'm not gonna be picturing him

 Uh, that is not something 
 we needed to know. 
 He's kind of got a Peter Parker vibe, 
 which is exactly my type. 
 How about you guys? What's your type? 
 Uh, we should probably just focus. 
 I bet you like tall women. 
 - [JARED] Uh-huh. 
 - Uh... 
 [BOTH LAUGH] 
 I like sweet, handsome, 
 caring, and, yes, tall 
 men. 
 You're gay? 
 Right on. [CHUCKLES] Top or bottom? 
 Oh, wow. Charlie... 
 you're not in your med-school 
 study group, okay? 
 That is an inappropriate 
 question for a co-worker. 
 You could be fired. 
 Employers have to consider 
 my neurodiverse communication style. 
 No one should be forced 
 to change who they are 
 to be considered more professional. 
 Well, I'd suggest checking in with HR. 
 They may have a different idea 
 of reasonable accommodations. 
 People at work talk about 
 their relationships all the time. 
 Asking about someone's relationship's 
 a little different than asking about 
 their preferred sexual position. 
 The expression doesn't 
 refer solely to sexual positions. 
 No rib fractures. 
 But... 
 what is that? 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
 [JEROME] The bleeding's stopped. 
 The blades are acting like a tourniquet. 
 We need to get this hand out 
 before his fingers get necrotic. 
 What if we pull his arm while 
 manually turning the blades in reverse? 
 Could grind up 
 whatever's stuck even more. 
 We have to cut the machine open. 
 How? The Jaws of Life are way too big, 
 and a saw could cut his arm 
 or overheat the metal. 
 Not if you irrigate 
 with cold saline as I work. 
 I'll go just deep enough 
 to weaken the metal, 
 and then we'll break it apart 
 with a rib spreader. 
 Brilliant. 
 Get me an ortho oscillating saw 
 with a metal cutting blade. 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
 It's a very irregular shape. 
 Could be an intramural abscess 
 in his esophagus. 
 The contrast enhancement 
 wouldn't be so uniform. 
 Yes, that is true. 
 What about an esophageal cancer? 
 That would be unusual. 
 - He is very young and... 
 - [CHARLIE] A nonsmoker. 
 I'm confident we can excise the mass, 
 but we need to do 
 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy 
 and biopsy first. 
 I have no idea what that is, 
 but it sounds awesome. 
 Please do it now. 
 Uh, Charlie? 
 Hmm? 
 Uh, it might be better trying 
 to be your authentic self 
 without repeatedly 
 interrupting your boss. 
 Thank you, Dr. Kalu. 
 I appreciate the advice. 
 [SAW MOTOR WHIRRING] 
 I think you may need to go deeper. 
 I can't risk popping through 
 and cutting the radial. 
 [DOM] Park, he's bleeding again. 
 Should you do a vascular cut 
 down and temporary ligation? 
 No, it's been too long already. 
 We need to get this thing open. 
 [SAW MOTOR WHIRRING] 
 [GRUNTING] 
 - Come on. Give me a hand. 
 - I-I can't. 
 Yes, you can. Just close your eyes. 
 Pretend you're at the gym. 
 - Come on. 
 - [JEROME] Come on. 
 All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! 
 Keep going. It's working. 
 - [JEROME] Pull, pull, pull! 
 - [DR. PARK] It's loose! 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Lap sponges! 
 Severe contamination 
 of hand and forearm, 
 arteries are trashed. 
 Major vascular gaps, 
 radius and ulna are crushed. 
 Get the OR prepped. 
 We're gonna have to amputate it. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Advancing down the esophageal lumen. 
 Do you have a boyfriend? 
 Yes. 
 Approaching 
 the gastroesophageal junction. 
 Is he tall? 
 Can we talk about this later? 
 Or not at all. 
 [ASHER] Doesn't make sense. 
 Dr. Kalu thinks I'm being too intrusive, 
 but I'm actually trying 
 to establish a rapport. 
 I wasn't talking about him or you. 
 I meant the mass. 
 It's gone. 
 [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] 
 [SHAUN] This doesn't make sense. 
 That's exactly what Dr. Wolke said. 
 The esophageal mass 
 was definitely on the X-ray. 
 And on the neck CT. 
 But nowhere on the endoscopy. 
 - Maybe we should repeat all the tests? 
 - No. 
 - We could... 
 - I can't concentrate 
 if you keep interrupting me. 
 I didn't interrupt you. 
 I asked you a question. You said no, 
 so I attempted to make a suggestion, 
 then you interrupted me. 
 Could you please just be quiet? 
 Okay. 
 [SIGHS] Okay. 
 [PAGERS BEEPING] 
 [OMINOUS MUSIC] 
 He's disoriented 
 and slurring his speech. 
 Phipps, do you know 
 where you are right now? 
 Um, I go to San Jose State University. 
 He is disoriented, 
 but no longer slurring. 
 - It was worse before. 
 - [JARED] Okay. 
 Squeeze my fingers. 
 - Right-side weakness. 
 - We should prep a bolus dose of TPA. 
 No, we should not do that. 
 Can you wiggle your toes? 
 But if he's having a stroke... 
 His speech is improving, 
 which makes a transient 
 ischemic attack more likely. 
 And you ordered a nurse 
 to prep an unindicated 
 and very risky medication. 
 I didn't order her, 
 just making a suggestion. 
 Get out. 
 What? 
 You refuse to acknowledge 
 you've made a mistake, 
 which wastes my time 
 and endangers our patient. 
 Please leave the patient's room now. 
 We need a head CT-CTA 
 to confirm it's a TIA 
 and not a brain bleed or tumor. 
 Checking pupils. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 [DR. PARK] Ligation and 
 sectioning of the viable arteries, 
 veins, and nerves complete. 
 Charriere. 
 I'll make the bone cuts 
 as distal as possible 
 - on the forearm. 
 - [DOM] Dr. Park. 
 [RETCHES] I gotta leave. 
 [JEROME] Maybe he should 
 sit this one out. 
 Bit of a worst-case scenario for him. 
 [DR. PARK] I gave him the opportunity. 
 He turned me down. 
 Have you gotten Morgan's 
 fecal-sample fridge installed? 
 I thought the idea 
 was to divide and conquer. 
 You do your half of the honey-do list, 
 and I do mine. 
 Yes, but just FYI, 
 Morgan needs the fridge installed 
 before she starts screening 
 for the IBS trial. 
 Yes, I'm aware. 
 Then I assume you're also aware 
 that it needs a new electric panel, 
 and that Gail has put a freeze 
 on all facility upgrades. 
 - Not my first rodeo. 
 - Okay. 
 And the other stuff on the list? 
 I plan to ignore. 
 You should do the same. 
 - You're advising I ignore the board? 
 - Yes. 
 Much of their complaints 
 are trivial in nature. 
 They'll either work themselves 
 out or disappear completely, 
 which is good for us, 
 because then we can do our actual jobs. 
 The current board isn't as passive 
 as the one you're used to dealing with. 
 The current board has some newbies, yes, 
 and they're very anxious to engage 
 and nitpick 
 over every little silly thing. 
 But you know what? 
 They'll learn. They always do. 
 I have an actual patient waiting. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Are we going in for a head CT? 
 Doctors Wolke and Kalu are. 
 You shouldn't have raised 
 your voice to me like you did. 
 I spoke with an urgency 
 that was appropriate to the situation. 
 It may be appropriate to some, 
 but as a person on the spectrum, 
 I don't do well when shouted at. 
 I did not shout. 
 I'm letting you know the parameters 
 for communicating with me effectively. 
 I'd appreciate your cooperation. 
 I'll go join Doctors Wolke and Kalu. 
 No. 
 You will go to the skills lab 
 and study stroke protocols 
 and procedures 
 for handling a TIA. 
 I didn't do anything wrong. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 [MONITORS BEEPING] 
 [DR. PARK] We didn't have to 
 debride as much as I thought. 
 And there's more than enough 
 palmar and dorsal flaps 
 to close the stump. 
 - [DR. PARK] 
 Checking my work? 
 - No. 
 Just rubbernecking. 
 It's not every day you get to see 
 a meat-grinder 
 partial radial amputation. 
 Thankfully. 
 But if I was checking, 
 now that I have a better view 
 of the injured area, 
 the distal forearm vessels and nerves 
 are actually better than I expected. 
 If you could bridge those gaps, 
 I'm wondering if you might 
 be able to reattach it. 
 [DR. PARK] Ischemic time 
 is less than eight hours, 
 and that's best case, which this isn't. 
 [DR. LIM] 
 Mm, not if there's 
 a blood supply. 
 You could graft it to his ankle, 
 keep it perfused 
 while you prep the forearm 
 stump for replantation. 
 You could really do that? 
 We've built new ears on forearms. 
 [DR. PARK] Wrist anatomy 
 is a lot more complex. 
 And if we spread 
 an infection to his leg, 
 he could end up losing 
 two limbs instead of just one. 
 We could reduce the risk by 
 planting antibiotic beads in the wounds. 
 [DR. PARK] Yeah, but not eliminate it. 
 Your call. 
 Prep and drape his left ankle. 
 Want a second set of hands? 
 [DR. PARK] 
 Absolutely. 
 But don't you 
 have a hospital to run? 
 That's what 
 co-presidents are for. 
 CT-CTA doesn't show any blockages 
 or atherosclerosis. 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 I'm starting to think this 
 might not be a stroke or a TIA. 
 The neuro symptoms didn't start 
 until after the esophageal mass 
 disappeared. 
 Uh, not true. 
 No, he came to the ER 
 with neurological symptoms, 
 a headache, and hearing loss. 
 Which isn't surprising, 
 given he let his idiot friends 
 slap him upside the head. 
 [ASHER] Mm. 
 Speaking of idiots, 
 you should go to the confirmation party. 
 Jerome mentioned it. 
 It's one party. 
 You might actually have fun. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Look, you love Jerome, right? 
 Right. So what makes you think 
 you wouldn't like his brothers? 
 [SIGHS] 
 - They play hockey. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 Didn't Jerome play hockey? 
 Yes, as a kid, 
 and not in something 
 called the Beer League. 
 This isn't about hockey or beer, is it? 
 You're just afraid. 
 I am not afraid. 
 I'm actually... I'm very busy. 
 Or you're scared they won't like you. 
 Or that it's the next big step 
 towards something 
 you're still not sure you want. 
 Thank you, Esther Perel, 
 but I know exactly what I want. 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay. 
 And I have it. 
 Well, maybe you should consider 
 making some sacrifices to hold on to it. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Had a nice walk with Morgan today. 
 She's preparing a living trust 
 and would like us to be Eden's 
 guardians if she and Park die. 
 Okay. 
 ""Okay"" you're fine with that plan, 
 or ""okay,"" you didn't hear a word I said 
 because you're still 
 obsessing about Charlie? 
 I'm fine with Morgan's plan. 
 I was thinking about Charlie, 
 not obsessing. 
 I can't work with her 
 constantly interrupting me. 
 She's a student, Shaun. She's excited. 
 She's enthusiastic. 
 Why does it matter 
 if she is enthusiastic? 
 She makes a lot of mistakes. 
 Well, now's the time to make mistakes. 
 She's a med student. 
 Charlie refuses to admit 
 she's made them, 
 which means she cannot learn from them. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Maybe she's embarrassed. 
 Maybe you're being 
 a little bit too rigid. 
 You know, give her a chance 
 to work things out. 
 I have not been rigid. 
 You're being rigid right now. 
 Why don't you try being 
 a little more patient? Right? 
 [STEVE FUSSES] 
 I will... try to be more patient. 
 Great. Let's eat. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 [DR. PARK] Ulnar to posterior 
 tibial artery anastomosis complete. 
 [DR. LIM] Sutured the main 
 dorsal to the saphenous vein 
 and created a fasciocutaneous flap 
 to provide temporary coverage. 
 [DR. PARK] Great. 
 Then I think we're ready. 
 Releasing the clamps. 
 [GENTLE TRIUMPHANT MUSIC] 
 Awesome. 
 Totally awesome. 
 I understand you have a bit of a 
 medical mystery on your hands. 
 Yes, it is very interesting. 
 How's your new med student? 
 She talks too much, 
 refuses to acknowledge mistakes, 
 and doesn't like to read textbooks. 
 That does sound like a challenge. 
 Dr. Glassman said 
 I should just be patient 
 and give her time to adjust. 
 Wrong. 
 Glassman's favorite way 
 to deal with a problem 
 is to avoid it and then hope 
 someone else solves it. 
 You need to tell her precisely 
 what you want her to do. 
 I have done that. 
 Well, do it again. 
 She's young and faces 
 communication challenges 
 that you need to be sensitive to. 
 All her recommendations say 
 she's smart but stubborn, 
 which, if managed properly, 
 could be a great combination. 
 You of all people should know that. 
 Uh, why should 
 I 
 know that? 
 Because you also arrived here 
 smart but stubborn. 
 You've become a great surgeon, 
 and she will be, too. 
 But for now, she's like a puppy 
 that needs to be trained 
 before all the bad habits take hold. 
 So don't be patient, be proactive. 
 Hmm. 
 [DR. PARK] There's no cyanosis, 
 severe edema, or venous stasis. 
 Looks great. 
 It looks gross. 
 Don't worry. As soon as we clean up 
 all the damage to your arm, 
 it'll go back to where it belongs. 
 Good, because I'm gonna need both hands 
 to wring that butcher's neck. 
 Dr. Park? 
 [OMINOUS MUSIC] 
 What's wrong? 
 There's some cellulitis at the forearm. 
 But don't worry. You're on antibiotics, 
 and we'll watch it closely 
 until your next surgery. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Sorry. I'm running late. 
 It's like packing for 
 the Lewis and Clark expedition 
 every time I leave the house now. 
 No worries. I got you an Americano. 
 Thanks. 
 Shaun agreed. We're good to go. 
 One thing... 
 I named you and Shaun as guardians 
 if both Park and I die, 
 but also if just I die. 
 Why wouldn't Park be her guardian? 
 Don't tell me you guys 
 are on the rocks again. 
 No, things are great. 
 Actually, better than great. 
 They're fantastic. 
 So what's the problem? 
 The last thing I want 
 is for Eden to end up 
 with an ex-boyfriend if I die. 
 We've only been back together 
 a couple months, 
 so I'll revisit the plan in a year. 
 Okay. I'll let Shaun know tonight. 
 No, Shaun can't keep a secret. 
 I haven't told Park, 
 and I'm not going to. 
 Are you insane? 
 You can't lie to Park, 
 and I can't lie to Shaun. 
 It's not a lie. It's a secret. 
 And every marriage has them. 
 Uh, sure. 
 Like how much I spend on hair color 
 and how often I use his toothbrush, 
 but this is too big. 
 No, it's a tiny, temporary detail 
 that's meaningless unless I die 
 in the next 12 months, 
 which isn't gonna happen. 
 Please, just take a few days, 
 think about it. 
 That's all I'm asking. 
 I'm not gonna change my mind, but okay. 
 [JARED] Head CT looks normal, 
 but the abdominal images 
 showed acalculous cholecystitis. 
 Hmm. That wouldn't explain 
 his neurological symptoms. 
 But it does explain the fever 
 and the abdominal pain he has now. 
 We got another abdominal CT. 
 Gallbladder's dilated 
 with extreme wall thickening. 
 Looks like it's about to rupture. 
 [SHAUN] Doesn't make sense. 
 His most severe symptoms 
 have been neurological, 
 and neither the bruise on his chest 
 nor the mass in the esophagus 
 was near the gallbladder. 
 Whatever the cause, 
 his gallbladder needs to be removed. 
 Get him prepped. 
 - [DOOR OPENS] 
 - Charlie? 
 We need to have a talk. 
 Please have a seat. 
 I'd rather stand. When I'm nervous, 
 sitting makes me feel 
 uncomfortably constrained. 
 Okay. 
 You are still a student, 
 so it is normal for you 
 to be making mistakes. 
 I haven't made any mistakes. 
 You ordered a nurse to prep an incorrect 
 and potentially dangerous medication. 
 I didn't order her. I made a suggestion. 
 And you talk too much, 
 often about things you shouldn't 
 and other times 
 when you shouldn't be talking... 
 I learn more by discussing things 
 rather than reading a textbook 
 or attending a lecture. 
 I do not lecture, 
 and I can't do my job 
 if you are always interrupting... 
 At times, my speech pattern can be... 
 - You just did it again. 
 - So did you. 
 Compulsive speech is a 
 characteristic of our neurodiversity. 
 Please s-stop talking. 
 I am being proactive. 
 I have precisely explained 
 my expectations. 
 You can't order me to do 
 something I'm incapable of. 
 I have a disability, and the law... 
 I am trying to help you. Okay? 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
 I... understand 
 that ASD is considered a disability. 
 But I also know that you are 
 capable of being silent. 
 If you want to remain on this case, 
 that is what I expect you to do. 
 You are to observe and nothing else. 
 Do you understand? 
 Yes. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Good. 
 Now you can go join Dr. Wolke 
 and Dr. Kalu in the OR. 
 [DR. LIM] We've got adequate debridement 
 of the distal forearm stump. 
 [DR. PARK] This is gonna work. 
 Good call. 
 Hubank, any thoughts 
 on what suture to use 
 for our arterial anastomosis? 
 I'm not sure. 
 [DR. PARK] 
 Take your time. 
 Look closely at the angle 
 we cut the vessels at. 
 I guess you could suture the ends 
 with a 4-0 Prolene 
 using an end-to-side formation. 
 [DR. PARK] Nice idea. 
 End-to-end anastomosis 
 with parachute technique 
 would work even better. 
 [QUIRKY MUSIC] 
 I'm Dr. Reznick. 
 I assume you know that Park 
 and I are in a relationship. 
 - Actually, no. I didn't... 
 - Don't lie. 
 I know how fast the gossip 
 gets out around here. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 How's Park as a professor? 
 He's awesome. 
 Intuitive and supportive 
 without being patronizing. 
 Stop. 
 The whole gentle-giant thing 
 is lost on me. 
 What I respect is totally brutal, 
 blunt honesty. 
 Think of me like Bill Belichick 
 but meaner and with better hair. 
 You're right. I lied. 
 I was actually told by a 
 bunch of people on my first day 
 about the relationship 
 that you and Park had. 
 I was also told how you broke up 
 then moved back in with one another 
 before breaking up again, 
 then got back together recently 
 because Park wanted to help you 
 take care of the baby 
 that you wanted to adopt 
 but were too overwhelmed 
 to do it yourself 
 while also running the clinical trials. 
 But I wasn't lying about Park 
 being an awesome professor. 
 He's been pretty patient and supportive, 
 despite the fact that 
 I don't want to be a surgeon, 
 and I faint or hurl 
 at the sight of any amount of blood. 
 But he's a great guy. 
 And I'm sure he'll be 
 a great dad or stepdad 
 or whatever the label is 
 that you need him to be for you. 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
 Is that blunt enough? 
 Yes. Thank you. 
 But careful. 
 Nobody likes a smart-ass. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [SHAUN] Freeing up the last 
 attachments to the liver. 
 [ASHER] Using ultrasonic coagulator 
 for hemostasis on the cystic plate. 
 What about an atypical 
 presentation of lupus? 
 [JARED] ANA and ESR are all normal. 
 [ASHER] That's why I said atypical. 
 I mean, what else could cause symptoms 
 in the esophagus, 
 brain, and gallbladder? 
 [SHAUN] Dr. Kalu, please irrigate 
 and lead the wound closure. 
 [JARED] 0 Vicryl sutures 
 on a long needle driver. 
 [CHARLIE] Can I feel it? 
 Sorry. I know 
 I'm not supposed to be talking, 
 but I've never felt a live organ before. 
 [SHAUN] It needs to go to pathology. 
 And please don't distract Dr. Kalu. 
 [JARED] Oh, she's not distracting me. 
 [ASHER] It's just gonna sit in the 
 pathology fridge 
 for a few hours anyway. 
 [SHAUN] Do it quietly. 
 [CHARLIE] Thank you, Dr. Murphy! 
 [JARED] Sponge here so I can see better. 
 Need another 0 Vicryl suture. 
 [ASHER] And I'll take 
 the Metzenbaum scissors. 
 [SHAUN] That's enough. Put it back now. 
 Wait. Just give me a... Ow! 
 I think a needle got left in the organ. 
 [SHAUN] That's not possible. 
 We never suture inside the gallbladder. 
 I know I felt... felt it. 
 Ow! Okay. There is 
 something sharp in here. 
 Uh, maybe it's an edge of a gallstone? 
 [PENSIVE MUSIC] 
 [SHAUN] I'm coming. 
 Okay. 
 There is something protruding. 
 Small forceps. 
 [CHARLIE] Is it a hair? 
 [SHAUN] No. 
 It's a metal wire. 
 [OMINOUS MUSIC] 
 Inside the gallbladder? 
 How is that even possible? 
 It was definitely 
 not part of a surgical tool. 
 Well, I read a case a few years ago. 
 A patient got a metal wire 
 from a barbecue grill brush 
 lodged in his intestines. 
 When we were doing surgical prep, 
 Phipps said the last thing he'd eaten 
 was a cheeseburger 
 at his frat's barbecue. 
 The disappearing mass in his esophagus 
 could've been caused 
 by that wire lodged there 
 before it traversed the stomach wall 
 and ended up in the gallbladder. 
 That would be amazing. 
 It wouldn't explain 
 his neurological issues. 
 Well, that could still 
 be from the slaps. 
 But either way, 
 we never would've noticed it 
 without Charlie's curiosity, so... 
 Yeah. Nice catch. 
 It was more of an accident 
 than a catch, but thank you. 
 [INQUISITIVE MUSIC] 
 We need the strongest 
 magnet we have. Stat! 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm teaching Steve how to run the table 
 while, simultaneously, Barry and I 
 are trying to figure out how to lower 
 the overhead cost of the clinic. 
 - Try those. 
 - [CLEARS THROAT] 
 ""The poop fridge 
 equals presidential priority""? 
 You see, Steve? I told you, 
 alliteration comes off as pompous. 
 He prefers ""poop"" to ""fecal samples."" 
 I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself. 
 Meanwhile, Gail is coming down 
 on me for things I didn't do. 
 Hey, it's my signature on the thing. 
 If Gail doesn't like it, 
 she can come to me. 
 She knows you don't listen to her. 
 So, now, every time she has a problem, 
 she comes to me. 
 Well, I can think of 
 one way to solve that problem. 
 Aaron, I don't have time 
 for these games. 
 You don't have time 
 because you're constantly 
 trying to placate the damn board. 
 All they want is to feel 
 recognized and respected. 
 All they want, they don't know it, 
 but what they really want is a well-run, 
 top-flight hospital. 
 Well, all Gail really wants now 
 is a full audit of all expenses 
 for the past year. 
 Well, that's a colossal waste of time. 
 Well, I agree. 
 And after a 30-minute discussion, 
 I got Gail to agree as well. 
 This division of labor isn't working, 
 so from now on, you can deal with Gail. 
 Fine. Send her on over. 
 Just tell her to bring cash. 
 We don't take markers here. 
 He's an ass. 
 Not an ass. 
 What are you gonna do with that? 
 It may be slightly painful, 
 but it's much safer 
 than another surgery. 
 Open wide and say, ""Ahh."" 
 Ahh. 
 [GAGGING] 
 [COUGHS, GROANS] 
 [MOANS] 
 That was in my tonsil? 
 Yes, it caused an infection 
 and fluid build-up in your ear 
 and irritated your carotid artery, 
 which caused the neurological symptoms. 
 You shouldn't ever clean a 
 cooking surface with a wire brush, 
 or let someone slap you, 
 or sh**t you with a foam shotgun slug. 
 That is so cool. 
 Yes. It is. 
 I can't wait to get back to work. 
 I wouldn't rush it. 
 It's gonna take time 
 and plenty of physical therapy 
 to get your function back. 
 I don't mean so I can work. 
 I mean so I can fire that damn butcher. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 The new CTs are all clear. 
 No more wires floating around. 
 [JARED] And you might 
 want to take it easy 
 with the frat parties for a while. 
 I'm actually not that big a partier. 
 I grew up an only child, 
 so I always wanted brothers, 
 and now I have like 50 of them. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 They've helped me through 
 all sorts of stuff. 
 A lot of the crazier stuff 
 they do isn't my thing. 
 Um... 
 But I feel like I owe it 
 to them to participate. 
 To be there for them 
 like they were for me. 
 That's very generous of you. 
 [DR. PARK] You're doing great. 
 No, I'm not. 
 Can't even watch a surgery 
 from another room without dry-heaving. 
 That patient would've bled out in the ER 
 if you hadn't helped 
 break open the grinder. 
 Yeah. I make a great crowbar. 
 Surgery is always a team effort. 
 I'm happy to have you on my team. 
 Dr. Park... 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 [KNOCKS] 
 Dr. Murphy, can I talk to you? 
 I am trying to get home 
 to put Steve down. 
 This won't take long. 
 I just wanted to tell you 
 how impressed I was with you, 
 how you were able to move 
 that wire fragment 
 from the tonsil without surgery. 
 It was very ingenious. 
 And I also wanted to thank you 
 for letting me observe you in surgery. 
 I learned a whole lot. 
 Oh. That's good. 
 And you're welcome. 
 When I found the first wire 
 in the gallbladder, 
 it saved both the patient

 That is true. 
 That's a big contribution from a

 I'm not impatient. I'm an assertive,

 Charlie should not be upset. 
 I told her she would make

 Well, you've only worked 
 with her for two weeks. 
 And isn't she hoping to be a surgeon? 
 You said that I should be proactive.

 That's not proactive. That's hurtful. 
 Maybe it's not what you meant, but...

 I'm sure you believe that, 
 but that is simply not true. 
 Dr. Melendez put me on scut work 
 and threatened to fire me. 
 Dr. Han transferred me to pathology, 
 but I never gave up, 
 and I learned how to accept criticism 
 and improve my communication skills 
 in order to become a good surgeon. 
 Han and Melendez, 
 and I'm sure many other people, 
 were wrong about you. 
 But that doesn't mean 
 you should treat Charlie... 
 I am not wrong about Charlie. 
 She should 
 not 
 be a surgeon.

 How does the crying not bother you? 
 In prehistoric times, 
 when infants awoke in the night

 it could mean they had 
 been k*lled by wild animals 
 or competing tribes. 
 Steve's cries are designed by nature 
 to alert other adults 
 to take care of him. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 How much longer? 
 Ten seconds. 
 Nine, eight... 
 seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

 No, Shaun, please stay. 
 Sorry. I was, um... 
 Sorry. 
 I was just about to tell Shaun 
 that he'll be working 
 with Charlie Lukaitis today. 
 No, I'm going to work with Dom. 
 Charlie is disruptive and distracting. 
 She should be failed 
 out of this rotation. 
 That's a harsh assessment, 
 and one you can't make until 
 she's completed her rotation. 
 Then... 
 I want to opt out of being 
 a teaching attending. 
 You can't do that, Shaun. 
 This is a teaching hospital. 
 You can't opt out. 
 Well, actually, you can, 
 but you lose access to the residents... 
 Jordan, Kalu, Asher. 
 I prefer to work alone. 
 And you'd stick to simple surgeries. 
 Lap choles, appendectomies, 
 hernia repairs. 
 Not to mention, you'd lose 
 a third of your salary. 
 I cannot teach her. 
 She interrupts me, and when 
 I point out her mistakes, 
 she just argues with me. 
 Well, why don't you stop 
 pointing out her mistakes? 
 Why don't you start 
 pointing out things she does well? 
 Why would I do that? 
 Because when you criticize 
 people, they feel bad, 
 and that leads to arguments. 
 And that leads to Charlie 
 standing alone, mute in an elevator. 
 And that leads to more meetings with us. 
 I can't just let her mistakes go. 
 So, how about you try 
 a compliment sandwich? 
 When you need to give negative feedback, 
 stick it between layers of praise. 
 Charlie... 
 doesn't have two pieces

 Then make it a compliment 
 open-faced sandwich. 
 Find the bread, Shaun.

 There's nothing cool about it,

 why would she be with him?

 they stayed at in Baja.

 [SHAUN] Okay, I am running out of bread. 
 [JARED] Shaun. 
 Her liver has yellow 
 diffuse deposits and fibrosis. 
 [SHAUN] She has advanced fatty liver. 
 If this progresses, 
 she will need a liver 
 transplant or she will die. 
 It may take a few months 
 to regain full mobility, 
 but that shouldn't stop you 
 from walking down the aisle. 
 Thank you so much, Doctor. 
 So, how'd you two meet? 
 Well, we needed some 
 legal work done at the school 
 where I teach seventh grade English, 
 and somehow, a big fancy litigator 
 took us on pro bono. 
 - Not that fancy. 
 - No. Fancy. 
 And very modest. 
 I had, uh, lost my wife, Julie, to COVID 
 a couple of years before and... 
 Well, I was a mess. 
 I certainly never thought 
 I could fall in love again. 
 Neither of us expected this to happen. 
 But we're real glad it did. 
 It's a beautiful story. 
 When's the big day? 
 Hey, are you okay? 
 Yeah, it's just my stomach thing. 
 Uh, we're just waiting for Scott 
 to finish converting to Judaism. 
 I'm sure you know how long that 
 process can be, Dr. Wolke. 
 You're Jewish, right? 
 No. 
 Oh, I-I'm sorry, I... 
 I assumed... 
 I feel sick. 
 [SCOTT] Ronit? 
 [RETCHING] 
 Ronit. 
 - Look at me. 
 - Ronit! 
 Crash cart! 
 [DR. PARK] Stomach and duodenum 
 are normal. 
 Are you ready to admit 
 you're wrong about them? 
 Fine. They're in love. 
 But why not just peacefully live out 
 his golden years together? 
 Why is she making him jump 
 through all these hoops to get married? 
 Does he really want to spend 
 the rest of his years 
 studying the Book of Ruth? 
 She's not forcing him to do anything. 
 He wants to make her happy. 
 Yeah, by pretending to care about 
 something he doesn't 
 actually care about. 
 If he wants to stay married, 
 I also recommend pretending 
 to care about every 
 other thing she cares about. 
 Transverse colon is normal. 
 Also, it doesn't hurt 
 for a man of his age 
 to have a younger medical proxy 
 who cares about him. 
 So just give her power of attorney. 
 Yeah, maybe in a ceremony. 
 She could wear white. 
 - They could exchange rings. 
 - What's that called? 
 Why are you so invested in this? 
 Why are you so cynical? 
 Guys. 
 Left ovary and pelvic organs. 
 Dr. Glassman and Dr. Lim 
 suggested the compliment sandwich, 
 but it is very distracting 
 having to find two things 
 Charlie is doing right 
 just so I can correct her mistakes. 
 There are a lot of them. 
 What do we do in sleep training 
 when Steve cries? 
 We ignore him. 
 Ignore her. 
 Charlie isn't a baby. 
 When she makes mistakes, 
 it affects patients. 
 How often do med students 
 get to do something 
 that could actually hurt a patient? 
 Not very often. 
 So, when she does something 
 annoying, just let it go. 
 If you ignore the mistakes, 
 you don't need to look 
 for the compliments. 
 Well, yeah. That is worth a try. 
 [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] 
 Lucy's coming out of anesthesia. 
 I have to go. 
 Have you forgotten something? 
 Something to steel you against

 You have stage three ovarian cancer. 
 It's spread beyond 
 the ovaries and pelvis. 
 I told my GP months ago 
 that I was having back pain and nausea. 
 He said that it was 
 probably just stress. 
 Unfortunately, that's not uncommon.

 Hey, uh, I'm guessing 
 you're not okay with this. 
 You sleeping with my mom? 
 My dad did it for years. 
 We got along fine. 
 Since you're not okay with it, uh, 
 is there anything that I can do 
 to make this a little bit less awkward? 
 There's not going out with her. 
 Short of that? 
 You asked. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Are they? 
 Please don't make me think about 
 this any more than I already have. 
 Ah! Wow. 
 You've really gotta hand it to Glassman. 
 [SIGHING] I really don't. 
 Sleeping with your competitor's mom 
 has got to be the 49th Law of Power. 
 He's not my competitor. 
 He's my colleague. 
 Imagine if they got married. 
 That's why we are recommending 
 gastric sleeve surgery. 
 She's 14. 
 [DR. REZNICK] Lucy fits the guidelines. 
 She has a BMI of 40, 
 she's 136 pounds overweight, 
 and she's having severe 
 medical problems as a result. 
 Do other kids get surgery like that? 
 There were 1,400 bariatric surgeries 
 performed on adolescents in 2022, 
 and it's becoming 
 more common every year. 
 Dr. Murphy will remove a 
 large portion of your stomach. 
 That will help you to eat less. 
 And in ways 
 we don't fully understand yet, 
 it reduces the hunger signals 
 in your brain. 
 That is not wrong. 
 I want to do this. 
 Mom, I think about food all the time. 
 I don't want to keep fighting my body. 
 I'm just so tired. 
 Baby, I didn't... 
 I didn't realize you were 
 still hurting this much. 
 I didn't want you to know. 
 I was trying to fight it 
 on my own, but... 
 I don't think I can anymore. 
 Uh, okay. Let's do it. 
 Let's do it. 
 Charlie will return with 
 the preoperative consent form. 
 Responsibility. 
 Awesome. 
 Gunderson's doing a robotic-assisted 
 thoracoscopic lobectomy. 
 Gunderson. Isn't he a little green? 
 Yeah. He'll probably push the wrong 
 button and start a robot rebellion. 
 Can you assist? 
 I could shuffle some stuff around. 
 Great. Problem solved. 
 I do need you to write 
 that memo to the board, though. 
 What memo? 
 ""Latest Practices in Lean 
 Hospital Process Management."" 
 Oh, that memo. 
 The one you were supposed to write. 
 - Now that I'm bailing Gunderson out... 
 - You don't have the time. 
 Let me guess, it's due... 
 - Tomorrow. 
 - What a coincidence. 
 Now I can't take your mom out to dinner. 
 OR awaits. 
 Before I have you sign this, 
 I need to tell you 
 about the risks 
 of gastric sleeve surgery. 
 - Yeah, okay. 
 - Okay. 
 One, acid reflux. 
 Two, vitamin or iron deficiency. 
 Three, hernias. 
 Four, internal bleeding 
 during surgery or afterwards. 
 - That doesn't sound good. 
 - It's not. 
 Five, surgical wound infection. 
 Six, fatal blood clots. 
 - Fatal? 
 - Yeah, like a pulmonary embolism. 
 Oxygen is blocked from your lungs, 
 and you start to suffocate. 
 Seven, sepsis leading to organ failure. 
 - Wait. Hold on. 
 - I've changed my mind. 
 So have I. We're not doing this. 
 Guess you don't need 
 to hear about number eight. 
 You have put that girl's life 
 at risk by telling her that. 
 I did what I was supposed to. 
 I listed all the possible complications. 
 - Did you say how unlikely each one was? 
 - No, but... 
 Or explain that many were 
 - a complication of any surgery? 
 - I didn't think! 
 Or that this was a 
 relatively safe surgery? 
 - This is unfair. 
 - Stop interrupting me. 
 You're interrupting me. 
 I am the attending. 
 I have tried complimenting you, 
 but that didn't work. 
 I have also tried ignoring you, 
 but that also didn't work. 
 But I am required 
 to keep teaching you, though, 
 so you will have to go back to learning 
 by observing only. 
 You will not bother me. 
 You will not say a word, 
 either in surgery 
 or in front of the patient. 
 You're quiet. 
 I can't stop thinking about Ronit. 
 If her doctor had 
 only taken her seriously. 
 Imagine trying to plan a wedding 
 while she's in chemo and he's 
 recovering from a broken hip. 
 Who cares about their wedding planning? 
 She could die. 
 - They care. 
 - Well, they shouldn't. 
 Marriage is an outdated institution 
 that was invented 
 as a property transaction, 
 not as an expression of love. 
 How people feel about it now is... 
 That's all that matters. 
 Well, sometimes our feelings trap us 
 in conventional ways of thinking. 
 Like, Rashi says 
 that most of the Israelites 
 stayed enslaved in Egypt 
 because it's all they knew. 
 Are you seriously comparing 
 a loving marriage to sl*very? 
 Both were invented as a means 
 of exchanging human chattel. 
 That is offensive on so many levels. 
 And I doubt it's what Rashi, 
 whoever that is, 
 meant when he wrote that parable. 
 It's a Midrash, not a parable. 
 Well, you sure know a lot about Judaism 
 for someone who isn't Jewish. 
 Okay, I'm not a practicing Jew, 
 but I don't have to share 
 my life story with a patient. 
 Why didn't you just say, 
 ""I was raised Jewish, but I don't""... 
 [INHALES SHARPLY] 
 Hold on. I'll get you a bandage. 
 Here. 
 I don't feel like cooking anymore. 
 I'm going home. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 What are you still doing here? 
 Aaron and I are going out to dinner. 
 And salsa dancing. 
 You dance salsa? 
 You dance salsa? 
 My Spanish teacher got me into it. 
 You have a Spanish teacher? 
 She could actually be a Spanish teacher. 
 Habla muy bueno. 
 - [EILEEN] Ah, bien, actually. 
 - Bien, actually. 
 So, I was doing research 
 for this very urgent memo, 
 and I came upon this great 
 article on Lean Practices 
 in the Argentinian Journal 
 for Hospital Administration, 
 and it was in Spanish. 
 So I translated it for him. 
 So she translated it for me 
 and had some great ideas 
 for the memo itself 
 and saved me hours of work. 
 Oh, don't wait up tonight, hon. 
 [ASHER] With an open surgery, 
 Park and I can get more of the tumors. 
 Laparoscopic surgery lowers 
 the risk of complications, 
 which would allow her 
 to start chemo sooner. 
 Ronit's pre-op labs. 
 - Hey, Jordan. 
 - Hey, Jerome. 
 How's Grandma E? 
 Doctor said she'll recover fine. 
 Whether they'll recover 
 from me second-guessing 
 everything they're doing 
 is another question. 
 I'm glad to hear it. On both counts. 
 What was that? 
 We had a fight last night. 
 All right, this weekend, 
 I found a box in Jerome's drawer. 
 I'm pretty sure it was a ring box. 
 Tomorrow night's the second 
 anniversary of our first date. 
 I think he's going to propose. 
 Or I should say, was. 
 I don't know about now. 
 - But isn't that what you wanted? 
 - No, it is. 
 There's just something 
 about the ceremony of it all, 
 the ancient rituals, 
 it just feels... icky. 
 Ancient rituals? 
 We're talking about you getting married, 
 not sacrificing a goat. 
 I worry we'd only be doing it 
 because we're supposed to. 
 In Brooklyn, my path 
 was laid out for me. 
 Study the Talmud, 
 get married, have kids. 
 I didn't really have a choice. 
 What if this is the same thing? 
 Do you love Jerome? 
 - Absolutely. 
 - Then you do have a choice. 
 You can make a life 
 with the man you love 
 or find another path without him. 
 Bariatric surgery is conducted 
 hundreds of thousands 
 of times a year 
 in United States hospitals. 
 But what Ms. Lukaitis talked about, 
 the bleeding, the clots... 
 Serious complications are very rare. 
 How rare? 
 Based on my surgical record, 
 site infection rate is less than 1.5%, 
 and I would identify it early 
 and treat it well. 
 Excess bleeding is less than 1%, 
 and death is 1/20th of that. 
 What do you think, Mom? 
 I don't know. 
 I don't want her to be ashamed. 
 Last year... 
 she was suicidal because of 
 the teasing and the bullying. 
 And I was too, when I was her age. 
 We got counseling 
 and were really in a place 
 where she loved herself, 
 and I don't want you to lose that. 
 I was diagnosed with ASD 
 when I was five years old. 
 [SHAUN] That's not relevant. 
 And I told you not... 
 Shaun, I think they want to 
 hear what Charlie has to say. 
 Thank you. 
 My brain... 
 it doesn't process emotional signals 
 like other people's brains. 
 Same with Lucy's brain with hunger. 
 My parents wanted what was best for me, 
 but my mom, she didn't want me 
 to feel different. 
 So she was against me 
 having an in-school aid. 
 Thought it would stigmatize me, 
 but my dad convinced her. 
 They found a great aid 
 that helped me learn 
 to navigate the world. 
 This surgery won't stigmatize 
 your daughter. 
 It will give her 
 what she needs to thrive. 
 Everyone needs help sometimes. 
 Let Dr. Murphy help you. 
 Mom, please. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay. 
 Good job. 
 [DR. PARK] After radical debulking, 
 I don't see any obvious gross tumor. 
 [ASHER] Assessing 
 abdominal organs and spleen. 
 There are sub-centimeter 
 lesions on her liver. 
 [DR. PARK] Infiltrative 
 hepatic metastasis. 
 Check her diaphragm. 
 [ASHER] It's everywhere. 
 [DR. PARK] She probably only 
 has a couple months, if that. 
 Let's close. 
 What exactly is your motivation here? 
 Are you trying to piss me off? 
 Mark your territory? 
 What are you talking about? 
 You, dating my mom. 
 [CHUCKLES] You think this is about you? 
 It's crossed my mind. 
 Are you out of your mind? 
 Oh, come on. What do you 
 have in common with her? 
 My mom's... 
 She's, uh... 
 Yes? 
 Dull. 
 - My mom's dull. 
 - No, she's not. 
 She's a great person, a loving mother. 
 But she was a homemaker. 
 Not exactly the world's 
 most interesting woman. 
 [SCOFFS] 
 Let me tell you something 
 about your mom. 
 She learned Spanish 
 so she could read Don Quixote 
 in the original. Who does that? 
 She's seen every movie 
 in the Criterion Collection. 
 That's five stars right there. 
 She buys The New York Times 
 in paper form 
 so she can do the crossword, 
 which she does through Saturday. 
 I don't even get past Wednesday. 
 - She does? 
 - Yes, she does. 
 Maybe you should get to know 
 your mom a little bit better. 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 - I certainly will. 
 Thrilled for you two. 
 Plus, the sex is amazing. 
 I want to marry you. 
 It won't be a Jewish wedding, but... 
 der mentsh trakht un got lakht. 
 ""Man plans, God laughs."" 
 But if a Beit Din, 
 a council of three rabbis, 
 approves your conversion, 
 then there are only a couple steps left. 
 The big one being a ritual bath. 
 You can have a Jewish wedding here. 
 I'll set it all up for you. 
 I was raised Hasidic. 
 [IN HEBREW] You've done this 
 with strength. 
 You will be blessed. 
 [STEVE CRYING] 
 [IN ENGLISH] I'm sorry. 
 I just can't take this anymore. 
 - No. No. 
 - I have to rock him to sleep. 
 No, that is the worst thing we could do. 
 It will teach Steve that 
 if he cries for ten minutes, 
 he will get rewarded 
 with a hug from Mom. 
 Steve isn't a test subject. 
 He's our baby, and we need 
 to be flexible with him. 
 He will be fine. 
 I'm not sure I will be fine. 
 This is so hard. 
 And you have surgery tomorrow. 
 Don't you need your sleep? 
 We should focus 
 on how much better it will be 
 for all three of us in a few weeks. 
 Okay. 
 [CRYING CONTINUES] 
 Thank you for doing this, 
 Rabbi Benjamin. 
 I've adored Scott and Ronit 
 since I met them last year. 
 I'd do anything for them. 
 Now, time for some Jewish math. 
 We need 40 se'ah of natural water 
 and a wall between the 
 natural water and tap water. 
 And we aren't getting rainwater in here, 
 but Rav Kook and the Ben Ish Chai 
 wrote that we can use ice, 
 so we're going to need a lot. 
 We have a giant ice maker 
 on every floor. 
 [SPEAKING HEBREW] 
 Where do you go to shul, Asher? 
 Uh, I don't. 
 Or, you know, not since I came out. 
 You can't be gay and Jewish? 
 Well, aside from the explicit 
 prohibitions in Vayikra 18 and 20, 
 there's the Noahide laws 
 and the sin of Sodom, 
 as explained in Sanhedrin. 
 You should brush up on Sanhedrin. 
 According to the Midrash, 
 the sin of Sodom was cruelty 
 toward strangers, not h*m*. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Is an Orthodox rabbi telling me 
 that the real sodomites 
 are the h*m*? 
 If the Midrash fits... 
 You are a Jew, Asher. 
 Whether you want to be or not. 
 Anti-Semites don't give you a pass 
 because you have no mezuzah 
 on your door, 
 so might as well get 
 something positive out of it. 
 Respectfully, Rabbi, 
 I have everything I need in my life. 
 and you can't find anything of value? 
 The Torah isn't all or nothing. 
 Try lighting some candles 
 on a Friday night. 
 Take a little break on a Saturday. 
 Put some spare change in 
 the Tzedakah box for the poor. 
 Read Rambam... 
 or Philip Roth. 
 I do love bagels. 
 They're super carby, but I can 
 always scoop out the middle, right? 
 Heresy. And yet, a start. 
 [CHUCKLES]

 right now, okay? 
 [CHARLIE] That makes sense. 
 [SHAUN] Submerge the remaining 
 stomach in saline. 
 sh**t air in from the endoscope. 
 That will tell us what the problem is. 
 It's a leak. 
 We need to reinforce our

 [SHAUN] 4-0 Vicryls, fibrin glue. 
 [NURSE HAWKS] Get the 4-0's 
 from the suture cart. 
 Why aren't they on the back table? 
 [CHARLIE] I read in The Journal 
 for Bariatric Surgery 
 that they were rarely used, so... 
 [SHAUN] You should have 
 asked an attending. 
 I know she can be quite unrelenting, 
 but you should not make changes 
 based on the instructions 
 of a medical student. 
 - Starting sutures. 
 - [CHARLIE] It's not her fault or mine. 
 You have the stitches now, so... 
 I am trying to concentrate. 
 - Suturing. 
 - [CHARLIE] I need to explain myself! 
 [SHAUN] Stop talking. 
 You're distracting me. 
 [CHARLIE] I wanted to impress you. 
 It's a top journal... 
 [SHAUN] Get out of the OR! 
 [ALARM CONTINUES BEEPING] 
 Get out right now. 
 Goggles. 
 [ALARM STOPS] 
 No more anastomotic leak. 
 Let's close. 
 Lucy, we'll keep you here 
 for a couple of days, 
 and then you'll be good to go home. 
 When will I start to lose weight? 
 You can expect to lose 
 five to fifteen pounds per week 
 over the next few months. 
 [DOOR OPENS] 
 You look nice. 
 Going out? 
 Maybe. 
 I could tell that you were uncomfortable 
 when I saw you with Aaron. 
 And I think I knew you were 
 uncomfortable even before then. 
 But I just was having so much fun, I... 
 It was unfair of me. 
 - And I think that maybe I should just... 
 - Mom. 
 It was unfair of me. 
 Go have fun. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yeah. 
 Thank you, honey. 
 Why didn't you ever tell me 
 about learning Spanish 
 or salsa dancing or anything? 
 You never asked. 
 I guess I never thought 
 there was much to hear. 
 You and Dad... 
 He always seemed so in charge, 
 and you just... 
 went along. 
 I'm sure it did seem that way, 
 because I knew it was important to him. 
 He was old school. 
 But at its heart... 
 it was a partnership. 
 I didn't know. 
 You have always been 
 so ambitious, driven. 
 Is that because you didn't 
 want to be someone who just... 
 went along? 
 Maybe. 
 Is that why you and Clay broke up? 
 He hasn't called since I've been here. 
 None of his clothes are in the closet. 
 He wanted to get married. 
 And I wasn't sure. 
 So I did my usual. 
 I just avoided him 
 and I focused on work. 
 And he took the job in Chicago. 
 I'm so sorry. 
 I love my job. 
 I like who I am. 
 I don't need to get married again. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] But I don't 
 always like being alone. 
 I am always here for you. 
 Charlie Lukaitis won't listen to me. 
 She is putting patients at risk. 
 She should finish her rotation 
 at another hospital. 
 I cannot work with her anymore. 
 Well, apparently she can't 
 work with you, either. 
 She filed a complaint against you. 
 Thanks for the ride. 
 I really enjoyed our conversation today. 
 Yeah. 
 Yeah. Me too. 
 Asher, when was the last time 
 you wrapped tefillin? 
 Maybe another time. 
 Sorry, I just have an important 
 dinner to get to with my boyfriend. 
 I think he's going to pop the question. 
 And if he doesn't, I will. 
 Mazel tov. 
 Thank you. 
 - Until next time. 
 - Yeah. 
 [GLASS SHATTERS IN DISTANCE]

 He was driven, and he was brilliant.

 [GRUNTS] 
 [SOMBER ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS] 
 Are you okay? 
 Yes. 
 I am meeting with HR 
 to discuss Charlie's 
 complaint this afternoon. 
 Okay. 
 It's just been three days 
 and you've barely mentioned Asher. 
 I've read that grief reactions 
 are delayed in people with autism. 
 When a loss finally hits, 
 it can be really intense, 
 sometimes even overwhelming. 
 If that happens, find me anytime. 
 Okay. 
 Asher and I came from different worlds. 
 I am a devout Christian from Oakland, 
 and he was an Orthodox Jew 
 turned atheist from Brooklyn. 
 But when we met at St. Bons, 
 he became my closest friend. 
 Asher had a way of making you feel like 
 he saw the best version of you, 
 but he still loved you at your worst. 
 He was also one of the most 
 courageous people I knew. 
 Brave enough to leave behind 
 the people he loved 
 to be the person he knew he was inside. 
 He was stubborn and opinionated, 
 [CHUCKLES] had a strange 
 affinity for grandpa sweaters, 
 made a crazy-good margarita, 
 and he was just so, so much fun. 
 [BLINDS OPENING] 
 I've made breakfast. 
 I'm not hungry. 
 You're barely eating. 
 I know. I'm exhausted. 
 I couldn't sleep last night. 
 I know. 
 I've heard you up every night since... 
 Isn't your friend's funeral today? 
 Yeah. I-I think I'm coming 
 down with something. 
 I'm gonna do a swab at work. 
 I don't think you're sick. 
 You should talk to a therapist. 
 [SCOFFS] I just need sleep. 
 I have to tell you something 
 about your father. 
 And I should have told you this 
 years ago, 
 but I promised him that I... 
 Mom, I cannot do this right now. 
 - [CELL PHONE CHIMES] 
 - You idolized him, 
 and he never wanted you 
 to see him vulnerable. 
 You won't listen to me, 
 but you will answer a text? 
 Well, it could be work. 
 - Honey, your father... 
 - Ma, I gotta go. 
 [DOWN-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS] 
 He was one of the most 
 considerate people I knew 
 and a damn good doctor. 
 He knew what the patient wanted, 
 so he fought for it. 
 He made it happen. 
 But that was Asher... 
 standing up for his beliefs. 
 Even if it cost him his family, 
 even if it got him in trouble, 
 Asher always did 
 what he thought was right. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] And now he's gone... 
 ...because of a couple of 
 ignorant, hateful monsters. 
 They knew one thing about Asher. 
 One thing. And they k*lled him for it. 
 Left him lying there 
 bleeding on the pavement. 
 And those animals, they get to live. 
 And now he's dead. 
 And I hate them. 
 I hate them for taking my friend.

 I hope not. 
 You gonna have a problem 
 working with Dr. Murphy? 
 I hope not. 
 Okay. 
 Doctors Park, Kalu, and Allen, 
 you'll be treating Red Tag patients. 
 Dr. Reznick, you're with the ER 
 physicians on Yellow Tag patients. 
 Dom, you're on Green Tags 
 in the waiting room. 
 Green Tags? 
 Red Tags are urgent surgical patients. 
 Yellow, urgent non-surgical. 
 And Green, minor injuries. 
 Minor injuries. I can do that. 
 What about me? 
 You're on Black Tags. 
 But they're already dead. 
 Yes, every Black Tag patient 
 needs a pronouncement checklist 
 completed before they can be 
 moved to the morgue. 
 Those bodies are taking up 
 valuable space. 
 It feels like you're punishing me 
 for filing an HR complaint against you. 
 I am not. Not working with you 
 is an unintended benefit. 
 That's not how you're gonna 
 get her to drop the complaint. 
 And you're gonna need 
 all the help you can get today. 
 Yes, and I need more surgeons. Like you. 
 I'm not available. Remember? 
 You have experience, 
 and I am very short-staffed. 
 You're short-staffed 
 everywhere you look. 
 Give me Yellow Tags. 
 Bay six. 
 I'm taking her for an Ex-lap. 
 Jordan needs you. 
 [PARAMEDIC 2] I've got a red tag. 
 I need a surgeon. 
 Flora, blunt abdominal trauma, 
 This is Ken, massive flail chest. 
 I need a surgeon now. 
 There are only two of us. 
 Move them to adjoining bays. 
 She is critically hypoxic. 
 My patient's bleeding out. 
 My guy's here because of him. 
 Ken jumped in front of the car, 
 saved a little girl. 
 - This the driver? 
 - Yeah. His leg's a mess. 
 Femoral artery's lacerated. 
 Tourniquet there. 
 - [MACHINE BEEPS] 
 - Pressure's critically low. 
 She must be bleeding into her abdomen. 
 FAST ultrasound. 
 What do you see, Dr. Allen? 
 Massive cardiac contusions, 
 pulmonary artery trunk tear, 
 lung lacs... 
 Okay, those are terminal injuries. 
 This patient needs a cut down 
 to clamp his common femoral artery. 
 I can cross clamp Ken's aorta. 
 That won't fix his heart. 
 He is a Black Tag. 
 He risked his life to save a kid. 
 That is very heroic. 
 He will be dead soon. 
 You can still save the driver. 
 We should try to do everything we can. 
 You have. Move on. 
 She's in cardiopulmonary failure. 
 [ALARM BLARING] 
 She's... dying. I can't save her, 
 but I can save the baby.

 She's minutes from anoxic brain injury. 
 There. In the pulmonary trunk... 
 Dr. Murphy, four more Red Tag 
 patients just came in. 
 There it is. 
 Amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream. 
 The clump of hair got stuck, 
 blocked her circulation. 
 Mom and baby will be fine. Yes? 
 While you've been in here, 
 four Red Tags arrived, 
 two nurses need central lines, 
 and Kalu's asking for you.

 Everything went flying.

 Cast-iron skillet, I think. 
 Let me take a look. 
 [GAGS] 
 Dr. Reznick! 
 [JARED] I think I can save his leg 
 with microvascular anastomosis. 
 [SHAUN] No, you need to 
 amputate below the knee. 
 [JARED] Limb salvage is tricky, 
 but I really think I... 
 [SHAUN] That is a six-hour surgery 
 with a less than 5% chance of success. 
 We could save six patients in that time. 
 [JARED] Okay. Clamping bone two. 
 [SHAUN] Huh. The last time 
 I was in this room, 
 Asher and I were doing a colectomy. 
 [JARED] You need a minute? 
 I am faster at limb amputation than you. 
 See the Red Tag in the corridor. 
 We're out of treatment rooms. 
 [SHAUN] Convert the storage 
 room into a trauma bay. 
 Can't. Charlie's still 
 processing the Black Tags. 
 I need to head home to Steve. 
 You want to come with? 
 I could make you a sandwich, 
 loan you a baby for an hour. 
 Steve's cuddles can be very soothing. 
 Thank you.

 - He's in a lot of pain. 
 - Who's your son? 
 Riley Larson. He's over there. 
 The driver. I know who he is. 
 Can you give him something stronger? 
 He had the standard dose 
 of morphine 30 minutes ago. 
 He's still hurting. 
 That's a shame. 
 There's a lot of people 
 hurting right now. 
 It takes some time 
 for the meds to kick in, 
 but he should feel some relief soon. 
 Move, move, move. 
 Tell the OR to prep for bypass. 
 It's okay, Amy. I'm here.

 Please just save her. 
 We're on our honeymoon.

 You can't check the pupil box 
 because this patient is still alive! 
 Starting ACLS protocol. 
 Cardiac arrest from a tension pneumo. 
 - Ethan needs this. 
 - No, that doesn't matter. 
 - He was a Black Tag? 
 - Lazarus effect. 
 When the paramedics did CPR, 
 air compressed his heart 
 until it stopped. 
 - I saved his life.

 Inserting a central line. 
 I was right about the pupil. 
 You were listening to a book

 You can't learn if you don't listen. 
 Asher was excellent at 
 receiving constructive criticism. 
 That's not a fair comparison. Asher... 
 You know what? 
 It doesn't matter who saved him. 
 Let's just keep him safe. Okay? 
 Central line is in. 
 All right, the pressure's good. 
 It's good. 
 Charlie, can you get us

 [SOUND MUFFLES] 
 [MAN, MUFFLED] Excuse me. Doctor. 
 [MUFFLED CONVERSATIONS] 
 You need to look at this. 
 I've been waiting two hours. 
 [SOUND NORMALIZES] 
 S-Someone will get to you soon. 
 After my arm gets infected. 
 We're doing the best we can. 
 Then get more doctors. 
 Hey, look around you. People are dying. 
 Sit down and wait your damn turn. 
 You have a new patient. 
 Charlie, I need that thing. 
 Sorry. I was reading Ethan's EKG. 
 Hook up the drain now. 
 Good. Start suction. 
 You're doing great. 
 Dr. Murphy doesn't think so. 
 He's still evaluating me. 
 That's why I filed the HR complaint. 
 We'll deal with that 
 when the time is right. 
 A bad evaluation will stop me 
 from getting into a surgical residency. 
 No matter what I do, 
 Dr. Murphy will 
 find something to criticize. 
 Why is he like that? 
 Dr. Murphy has been held 
 to a higher standard. 
 He's doing the same thing to you. 
 That's not fair. 
 Nevertheless, 
 he wants you to be perfect, 
 so you do the best you can. 
 I need you to treat a complex 
 liver laceration, Dr. Glassman. 
 I'm not operating. I told you that. 
 It can't wait. 
 Well, Dr. Lee should be finished by now. 
 I just gave him an open hip fracture. 
 Well, then transfer the patient to SFG. 
 They are on diversion. 
 For crying out loud, Shaun, 
 you know the last time 
 I was in an operating room, 
 and a liver lac? 
 Yes, it is a complicated, 
 multi-step surgery. 
 Exactly. I might k*ll the patient. 
 He's already dying. 
 You are my only option. 
 So it's me or the janitor? 
 The janitor is cleaning trauma two. 
 He is very bright but is... 
 Okay. Okay. Okay. 
 Just give me Nurse V. 
 At least she'll keep me honest. 
 Nurse Villanueva 
 is running the ER with me. 
 Nurse Paikin, then. 
 Assisting Dr. Lee. 
 Nurse Lashelle, 
 she is very experienced and available. 
 Okay, fine. 
 Keep an eye on Mr. Newton's 
 hemoglobin and Ethan's EKG. 
 My son's pain medication 
 still hasn't kicked in. 
 I'm on my way to surgery. 
 It's been two hours. Please! 
 Then he's likely maxed out 
 for the next couple hours. 
 I know what you think of me. 
 I can't even argue with you. 
 He left me a letter. 
 He didn't think he'd still be alive. 
 He wanted to die doing this. 
 For as long as I can remember, 
 I've been trying to help him. 
 We tried everything. 
 Pills, therapy, 
 inpatient, outpatient. 
 Seemed like he was making progress. 
 Maybe that's just what I hoped. 
 [CRYING] I'm angry, too, at him. 
 How could he have done this? 
 And I'm angry at myself for not 
 knowing what he was capable of. 
 I wish you would help him. 
 [NURSE LASHELLE] He's down a liter. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Give me two units. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Okay, here we go 
 into the triangle of death. 
 So many things can go wrong. 
 [NURSE LASHELLE] 
 You want to talk it out? 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Clamp the porta hepatis. 
 Ligate the left hepatic 
 to control the bleeding. 
 Remove the left lobe... 
 - Dr. Glassman? 
 - Yes. 
 I need you to look 
 at Ethan's rhythm strip. 
 Is it urgent? 
 He's in sinus rhythm, 
 but I noticed a run of PVCs. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Well, keep him monitored. 
 I'll check it when I'm done. 
 But a half hour ago, he had another run. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Didn't I tell 
 you to check every 45 minutes? 
 I'm being thorough. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] PVCs are fairly common. 
 Can I do a 12 lead and electrolytes? 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] 
 That's a good idea, Charlie. 
 Run it past Dr. Paxton in cardiology. 
 [CHARLIE] Mm. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] Okay. 
 Clamp the porta hepatis. 
 Ligate the left hepatic 
 to control the bleeding. 
 [DR. LIM] I need threaded 
 pins here to stabilize the pelvis. 
 [JL] What is it? 
 [DR. LIM] He looks a lot like Asher. 
 [JL] Maybe a little.

 [DR. LIM] There's bleeding

 [ALARM CONTINUES BLARING] 
 Okay, your pressure's pretty high.

 Maybe that doctor lady 
 should do another EKG. 
 I learned about mindfulness-based 
 meditation last semester 
 in psych class. 
 I think that could help you. 
 I'm here for medical care, not yoga. 
 - Is that bad? 
 - It's just a little nosebleed. 
 Pinch hard. 
 I've never had a nosebleed like this. 
 I need a doctor in here. Hello? 
 Why is it not stopping? 
 Okay, 500cc bolus. 
 Get her to OR three with Dr. Lee. 
 I need to hand off to a doctor. 
 One minute. 
 Morgan can close this when she's free. 
 Two more Red Tags in the corridor. 
 - Have Jared take them. 
 - Dr. Kalu's still in the OR. 
 Then get Asher. 
 Asher? 
 Oh. He's dead. 
 One of the Red Tags 
 has a chest impalement. 
 He could go south soon. 
 Doc, my crew has an urgent pick-up. 
 Dr. Quao needs an anesthesiologist, 
 but they're all tied up. 
 I need you to look at Ethan's EKG. 
 There are some unusual patterns. 
 Dr. Glassman is supervising you. 
 He's busy. He sent me to Dr. Paxton. 
 He thinks this is normal, 
 but I think Ethan is gonna die again. 
 Okay. 
 Dr. Paxton was right and I am very busy. 
 If you compare them over the two hours, 
 you'll see the clusters. 
 - Sorry. 
 - Quao really needs an answer. 
 And that Red Tag needs a surgeon. 
 Okay. 
 - Look, two hours ago... 
 - Okay. 
 - [SOUND MUFFLES]

 Dr. Murphy, Quao really needs an answer.

 you're covering your ears. 
 [SOUND MUFFLES] I think you're

 But maybe it would help 
 if you broke it down...

 We can't wait any longer. 
 Go find Dr. Park. 
 Get the plastics resident to 
 close for Dr. Park in OR one. 
 and send Dr. Park 
 to the corridor patient. 
 EMT can hand off to Dr. Steffy 
 in the procedure room. 
 And the anesthesiologist in trauma five 
 should be finishing soon. 
 Come with me now. 
 We are going to save 
 your patient's life. 
 He has a ventricular aneurysm. 
 His heart's going to rupture. 
 There's no empty OR and this can't wait. 
 - I will have to operate.

 - I can treat an infection. 
 I can't do anything for him 
 if he's dead.

 I am so sorry. 
 Yeah. 
 Oh. 
 What were you gonna tell me

 [CLEARS THROAT] 
 He was an amazing man. 
 Love of my life, really. 
 And he had clinical depression. 
 What? 
 He traveled for work, 
 but some of those trips, 
 they were hospital stays. 
 And he never wanted you to know. 
 - Why? 
 - Because... 
 he loved being your hero. 
 He loved being a success, 
 being immersed in his work. 
 But when those things 
 weren't propping him up... 
 he would get lost. 
 And I know that I am far from exciting. 
 No, you weren't all wrong about me. 
 More than anything, 
 I have found fulfillment 
 from the small connections 
 that I share with people... 
 like making cookies for my daughter. 
 He would have been so mad 
 that I told you, 
 but I realized that 
 I couldn't keep telling you 
 that I was worried about you 
 without telling the truth about why. 
 I loved your dad, 
 almost as much as I love you. 
 I am so proud of who you have become. 
 And I don't want you to end up like him.

 - Bilingual bonus. 
 Right? And it will be so much 
 easier to go back to work 
 if I know Steve is happy without me. 
 But Shaun has reservations. 
 There's a whole process involving 
 spreadsheets, ranked voting. 
 Screw that. Good nannies 
 are hard to find. 
 You gotta pounce now. 
 I can't just make 
 that decision without Shaun. 
 Your body is no longer 
 tolerating the dialysis, 
 and it is putting you at high 
 risk for stroke or cardiac damage. 
 We need to start you on 
 continuous renal replacement therapy. 
 ""Continuous"" meaning...? 
 [JORDAN] Your mom has to stay here 
 until she receives a kidney transplant. 
 I want you home, not living 
 in a hospital for years. 
 It won't be years. 
 CRRT is usually only effective 
 for about one week. 
 And then? 
 Complications will set in, 
 and without a transplant, she will... 
 W-We're going to find a kidney. 
 The last two donors weren't compatible. 
 Suki. Let's try to stay positive. 
 How? The video I posted last night 
 asking for donors 
 only has a few hundred views. 
 I don't have enough followers. 
 Come here, baby. 
 You have such a good heart. 
 We will place a catheter 
 in your right jugular vein 
 and start CRRT. 
 Looking forward to 
 my internal medicine rotation 
 with you, Dr. Reznick. I really... 
 Each of the urine samples 
 needs a dip test. 
 Each of the stool samples 
 in the poop fridge 
 needs a fecal occult blood test. 
 Okay. I don't know how to... 
 Dip the pee. Dab the poo. 
 Send to the lab. 
 It's not rocket science, MacGyver. 
 But first, that little blond girl, 
 Zelda, needs her TDAP vaccine. 
 And be careful. She's a biter. 
 - Excuse me. 
 - Hey. 
 I saw a video post about a patient here. 
 Where do I go to donate my kidney? 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 [LIGHT-HEARTED MUSIC PLAYS] 
 [CRASHING] 
 I was supposed to raise 
 my legs and slide on my butt. 
 Did you hear any cracking sounds? 
 No. I didn't realize my leg was 
 hurt until we were driving home 
 and the adrenaline wore off. 
 Did that say 1.6 million views? 
 Turns out that when your 
 tech-savvy daughter 
 helps you with your bucket list, 
 you end up an influencer. 
 You've got a Grade 4 
 malignant spinal cord tumor. 
 How long did they give you? 
 About a year. 10 months ago. 
 Which is why I took a break 
 from college. 
 Spend as much time with him as possible. 
 Make videos. 
 And memories. 
 [DR. PARK] Let's get x-rays 
 and a CT of the femur. 
 Get you back on your feet 
 as quick as possible. 
 Okay, if you'll lie down, 
 we'll get you down to radiology. 
 Jerome, do you mind 
 just unlocking that side? 
 Sorry. I need to leave. 
 Yes, hi. It's Aaron Glassman 
 checking in on those images. 
 Well, when... [SIGHS] 
 They were supposed to be ready today. 
 Fine. Can you have them 
 call me as soon as they come in, please? 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. 
 I'm Dr. Glassman. 
 I can just tell you what's in there. 
 World-stopping headaches. 
 Over and over for the past three years. 
 The only thing that helps is... 
 Oxycodone 20s. 
 Yeah. 
 And then, like a total klutz, 
 this morning, 
 I knocked my pill bottle off the sink, 
 and they all fell into the toilet. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Your prescribing doctor is unreachable, 
 and it says here you're drug-seeking. 
 After three years of oxy and 
 a revolving door of doctors, 
 - that doesn't surprise me. 
 - Forget it. 
 I'll find another doctor. 
 Like I said, total klutz. 
 Hang on, hang on. 
 - Sit. 
 - I don't have to listen to you. 
 I know. You don't. Please. Sit. 
 Follow my finger. Look to your left. 
 All the way to the right. 
 You have a twitch in your eye. 
 Did you know that? 
 Is that a thing? 
 It might be a thing. Tap your finger 
 and your thumb together. 
 There you go. 
 All the way to your pinky and back. 
 How about a partial refill? 
 Tide me over? 
 Just until my doc gets back. 
 No pills, but I am going to order you 
 a brain and spinal MRI. 
 Any family history of kidney disease? 
 Not that I know of. Mom's a saint, 
 and I'm adopted on my father's side. 
 Under name, you only put ""Emmanuel."" 
 Yeah, that's what people call me. 
 Like Beyonce. 
 - [CHUCKLES] 
 - Hmm. Okay. 
 If the blood and tissue type 
 match with our patient, 
 we'll do a crossmatch test 
 and we'll see... 
 Yeah, we'll match. 
 Whenever I donate, they 
 tell me I have golden blood. 
 Rhnull? 
 That's the rarest blood type on Earth. 
 Only 100 cases. 
 That makes you a universal blood donor. 
 Birthplace just says Nazareth. 
 Is that in Pennsylvania? 
 No, the other one. 
 If the blood type tests out, 
 that's great news. 
 Almost done here. 
 Uh, you left occupation blank. 
 I'm a carpenter by trade, 
 but I really consider myself a teacher. 
 - Dear Lord. 
 - Yeah, I go by many names. 
 Uh-huh. This man thinks he's Jesus. 
 I've been sent here to help. 
 EGFR and uACR are normal. 
 Both kidneys are fully functional. 
 He is an ideal donor. 
 Except he's obviously crazy. 
 He thinks he's Jesus. 
 Technically, we can't prove he isn't. 
 I mean, the Bible says Jesus 
 will return to Earth someday. 
 There's several examples 
 of ordinary people 
 becoming holy figures later on in life. 
 Muhammed didn't receive 
 his first revelation from God 
 till he was 40. 
 [CLEARS THROAT] I minored in theology. 
 He's certainly your patient's savior. 
 Without him, she's dead in a week. 
 It is possible we could find 
 another donor, but unlikely. 
 but that doesn't mean we 
 should allow a delusional man 
 to make life-altering decisions. 
 And the surgery poses 
 a bigger risk for him. 
 We can only give him blood 
 from another Rhnull donor, 
 which is nearly impossible to find. 
 Regardless, we should 
 reach out to his family. 
 Parents are dead. 
 His emergency contact is his landlord. 
 If he wants to save someone's 
 life, I say we let him. 
 UNOS policy says organ donation 
 is contraindicated 
 if there is inability 
 to give informed consent 
 due to impaired cognitive 
 or intellectual capacity. 
 That's not our call. 
 We need a psych consult. 
 Your patient is suffering 
 from delusional disorder of grandiosity. 
 However, he can reliably articulate 
 that he understands the procedure. 
 His driver's license indicates 
 that he has been an organ donor 
 for at least a decade. 
 That suggests this decision is 
 consistent with his values. 
 He is completely competent to donate. 
 Hallelujah. 
 [LAUGHS] I don't know how 
 you live over half a century 
 without trying an oyster. 
 Well, I always wanted to. 
 I just... I don't know, 
 I chickened out because 
 they always look so goopy. 
 [LAUGHS] Well, no more fear. 
 Slurp away. 
 Mmm. Wow. Mmm. 
 [CELLPHONE BEEPS] 
 Your femur's not fractured. 
 Oh. Good. 
 But the pain you're feeling is called 
 referred neuropathic pain, 
 from a fracture in your spine. 
 It's compressing your spinal cord. 
 Not good. 
 The tumor has infiltrated and 
 weakened your spinal column. 
 It likely fractured when you 
 hit the ground after skydiving. 
 So how do we fix it? 
 Open spinal stabilization 
 and fusion surgery. 
 We replace your 
 fractured vertebrae with a cage 
 and add bone grafts, screws, 
 and rods for support. 
 You should be back on 
 your feet in about six weeks. 
 That could be more than half 
 the time we have left. 
 There is another option 
 with simpler surgery. 
 No cage and no bone grafts, 
 much shorter recovery time, 
 but even a small bump 
 could break it again. 
 So I'll avoid small bumps. Let's do it. 
 Dad, are you sure? 
 We have a mountain to climb. 
 We'll go get prepped. 
 Come on, get your camera rolling. 
 I got 11 more to go. 
 Dad, you're so old. 
 Cameras don't roll anymore. 
 [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
 We still need to run an MRI 
 on the potential donor 
 to evaluate the kidney's structure. 
 But the labs show 
 he could be an excellent match. 
 Your video worked. 
 Turns out you don't need 
 a million followers. 
 Just one... who thinks he's Jesus. 
 [LAUGHS SOFTLY] 
 Hashtag blessed. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [SIGHS] 
 I would like to hire Joelle 
 as Steve's nanny. 
 I worked it out. 
 If we cut it down 
 to two streaming services 
 and I stop buying Steve 
 so many cute outfits 
 and we don't go on that trip 
 this summer, 
 we can afford her. 
 Whew. This is a very 
 - thorough spreadsheet. 
 - Mmm-hmm. 
 You clearly have 
 strong feelings about this. 
 We can hire Joelle. 
 - Shaun! Yeah! [LAUGHS] 
 - Okay. 
 Okay, we should call her. 
 Yes. 
 [LINE RINGING] 
 [JOELLE] Hello? 
 Joelle, it's Lea and Shaun, 
 and we are so, so excited 
 because we would love to hire you. 
 Oh. 
 - You stole my nanny? 
 - She wasn't your nanny. 
 Yet. And you knew I wanted to hire her. 
 I encouraged you 
 to hire her on the spot. 
 But you hemmed you hawed 
 and you dilly-dallied 
 and you spreadsheeted, so I took action. 
 And outbid me. It's so gross. 
 I told you that good nannies 
 are hard to find. 
 My current one is late half the time, 
 and she costs more than Joelle. 
 I wanted to close the deal, 
 so I made an aggressive offer. 
 I feel like I don't even know you. 
 I'm finished with the perianal abscess. 
 Great. Dressing change 
 for a diabetic foot ulcer in 5 awaits. 
 Nobody said wound care was glamorous. 
 Joelle has experience 
 with special-needs kids. 
 And she's bilingual. 
 I always wanted Eden 
 to be bilingual, so... 
 seriously, thanks. 
 You're trying to replace my 
 dream nanny with regifted wine? 
 - I'm not evil. 
 - Debatable. 
 [SIGHS] 
 You barely even looked at it. 
 Enough to see there's 
 no tonsillar herniation, 
 which is the main criteria for Chiari. 
 That's why I said Chiari Zero. 
 That's not a real diagnosis. 
 It is real. 
 It is controversial, but it's real. 
 Moderate cervical syrinx, 
 plus occipital headaches, 
 plus dizziness, 
 plus clumsiness with the finger tapping. 
 All symptoms of Chiari malformation. 
 And also symptoms of withdrawal. 
 Not the fluid in her spinal cord. 
 Too many doctors have 
 just fed her pain medication 
 or shooed her away altogether. 
 Because she's an addict. 
 And one who's around your 
 daughter's age when she died. 
 Wow. Okay. 
 Hannah's pain is real. 
 She's in actual pain. 
 Or she's doctor-shopping for a sucker. 
 Okay. So both can be true. 
 She's not gonna be able 
 to get over her addiction 
 unless somebody addresses her pain. 
 All right, fine. 
 I don't know how this is not worthwhile. 
 Leave the images. 
 Jerome bailed less than 
 an hour into his shift. 
 I'm worried about him. 
 He's going through it. 
 I was thinking you might go 
 talk to him after work? 
 I can't right now. 
 Yeah, no, of course. 
 Anything I can do for you? 
 Thanks. I've got an MRI. 
 People are free to choose. 
 God is simply aware of 
 what those choices will be 
 because He lives outside 
 of time and space. 
 Isaiah 57. 
 Sorry to interrupt your sermon. 
 Lie back. 
 I know we just met, but I sense a... 
 Like, a weight on you. 
 - A sadness. 
 - I'm fine. 
 I'm guessing you were close 
 to the young man who died. 
 How do you know about him? 
 [DOM] Dr. Allen, he's tachycardic 
 and his blood pressure's 
 elevated, 178 over 112. 
 Go get 20 milligrams labetalol. 
 People like to tell me things. 
 I like to listen. 
 So you're nosy. 
 Mmm. I'm friendly. 
 Um, his vitals are normal again. 
 Probably spiked due to anxiety, 
 maybe from the machine. 
 I'm not anxious. 
 I'm enjoying our conversation. 
 - [MACHINE WHIRRING] 
 - Oh. 
 Apparently, I'm the only one. 
 Try to keep still 
 and no talking during the MRI. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Hi. 
 Just checking in. 
 I was thinking I could 
 talk to Villanueva if you want, 
 about getting you some more time off. 
 Thanks, but I don't think 
 a few more days or... 
 weeks will make much of a difference. 
 I'm not sure I can ever come back. 
 I'm sorry. 
 [DR. PARK] Rod is placed. 
 Lock it in with set screws. 
 Thank you. 
 [DR. PARK] Jerome's still 
 not back today? 
 No. He's not sure 
 he can come back at all. 
 [DR. PARK] Too many memories. 
 He's still in shock. 
 Now tighten the instrumentation. 
 At least Paul gets to know 
 the end is coming and prepare, 
 say his goodbyes. 
 [DR. PARK] I don't think you 
 can ever really be prepared. 
 And I wouldn't want my 
 loved ones to watch me suffer. 
 Spine is stabilized. 
 Continue with 
 the endoscopic decompression. 
 So you'd rather not know it's coming? 
 I'll go to sleep one night, 
 never wake up, cut to black. 
 Hold up. 
 There's a clean margin 
 in the spinal column 
 surrounding the entire length 
 of the tumor. 
 That wasn't visible 
 in his previous imaging. 
 The impact of his landing must have 
 cut off blood flow to the tumor 
 at its perimeter, 
 caused it to shrink. [CHUCKLES] 
 I think this gives us room 
 to do a cordectomy. 
 We could remove his entire tumor. 
 And take out the majority 
 of his thoracic spinal cord with it. 
 Would paralyze him from the T3 down, 
 and his cancer will probably come back. 
 But it'd give him a lot more time. 
 Let's close him up, 
 see what he wants to do. 
 How much of his blood 
 have we banked so far? 
 Only two units, and if we draw more, 
 he'll be too anemic for surgery. 
 We found another in Australia, 
 but it wouldn't get here 
 until the end of the week. 
 [SHAUN] We can't wait that long. 
 Naomi may be too unstable 
 to survive the transplant. 
 We'll have to make it work 
 with the patient's own blood. 
 We'll need to ligate every 
 vessel twice before cutting. 
 Be precise and meticulous. 
 I really don't want 
 Jesus' blood on my hands. 
 Luckily, we will be double-gloved. 
 Give 7,000 units of Epogen 
 and 150 milligrams of iron 
 to increase RBCs. 
 Hi. 
 Are you entering your baking era? 
 Nope. They're for Joelle. 
 But I have three reject batches 
 I could bring you. 
 - I'm good. 
 - Okay. 
 Why are you making muffins 
 for Park and Morgan's nanny? 
 Because soon she'll be ours. 
 I've come up with some 
 additional cost-saving measures 
 so we can pay her a little bit more. 
 Mmm. There were other candidates, 
 many of them very well 
 qualified and less expensive. 
 Morgan stole our son's nanny. 
 That cannot stand. 
 Out of principle. 
 What principle? 
 If we get all of the tumor, 
 which I think we can, 
 we could extend your life 
 by five to 10 years. 
 Maybe more. 
 But I'll be a quadriplegic. 
 It's likely you'll maintain 
 some use of your hands, 
 unless the edema spreads upwards. 
 No, no, no, we're sticking with 
 our original plan. 
 Just get me back on my feet again, okay? 
 Dad, they said years. 
 You'd still have 
 all your mental faculties. 
 And you'd have me to help. 
 Can you get me some ice chips? 
 My mouth is really dry. 
 Just think about it, please. 
 Eve drew this in kindergarten. 
 I'm the tall one. 
 She's the one with the hair. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 She told me that her dream 
 was touching the sky with me. 
 And I promised her 
 that we would do that one day. 
 And then her mom and me, 
 we got a divorce, 
 and I lost a lot of years 
 with my daughter. 
 Well, this surgery would 
 give you a lot of years back. 
 After all these years of being absent, 
 I can't ask her to spend 
 her 20s taking care of me. 
 She should finish college, 
 start her own life. 
 Hi. This is Dr. Aaron Glassman again. 
 No, okay. I don't understand the delay. 
 Fine. Um, can you please have 
 them call me back either way? 
 Thank you. 
 [EXHALES] How you feeling? 
 Mm. You gave me the good stuff, so... 
 Yeah, well, guess what? 
 After the surgery, you're not 
 gonna need the good stuff, 
 nor are you going to need 
 to be telling stories 
 about spilling pills into toilets. 
 - It wasn't... 
 - Don't bother. 
 You left the emergency contact 
 blank on your pre-op form. 
 You planning to off me on the table? 
 Well, I'm not planning on it. 
 But if something were to go wrong, 
 I'm gonna need to contact 
 your mom or your dad. 
 Good luck. They kicked me out 
 years ago, so... 
 if you want someone who cares if I die, 
 guess again. 
 I'm gonna take the wild guess 
 that they still care. 
 You'd be wrong. 
 Father, thank you for loving us so much, 
 and we ask that you heal 
 Ruth's back pain 
 so she can get back to 
 the pickleball court. 
 - Amen. 
 - [RUTH] Amen. 
 The pain is gone! Thank you. 
 I think that's your pain meds 
 kicking in, Mrs. Wyatt. 
 Let's go. 
 I don't have time 
 to be looking all over for you. 
 I'm sorry. Helping people 
 in pain is kind of my thing. 
 No, it's my thing. I'm the doctor, 
 and my patients don't need 
 your snake oil. 
 - I'm giving them comfort. 
 - You're giving them false hope. 
 It's okay if you're angry. 
 He gets that a lot. 
 I'm not angry. 
 I just need you to stay put. 
 - [SIGHS] 
 - I didn't mean right now. 
 I just feel a little... 
 [GRUNTS] 
 I need help! 
 We cannot do the kidney transplant 
 until we know why he collapsed. 
 He's hypertensive 
 and tachycardic one moment 
 and then stable the next. 
 Could be carcinoid syndrome 
 or renovascular hypertension. 
 There are no suspicious masses. 
 His renal arteries look normal. 
 His labs rule out hyperthyroidism. 
 Everything about this guy is crazy. 
 Crazy is not a DSM-recognized 
 diagnosis, but you are correct. 
 His underlying condition 
 must have psychiatric 
 as well as physical symptoms. 
 He has a pheochromocytoma. 
 We need to surgically remove it. 
 It could not be seen on the MRI, 
 but it has been flooding 
 his system with hormones. 
 Once the pheo's out, we may find 
 Jesus has left the building, 
 taking both kidneys with him. 
 If that happens, 
 Naomi almost certainly dies. 
 We could remove the pheo 
 and the kidney at the same time. 
 Given his blood type, 
 every surgery is dangerous 
 because of our limited supply 
 of Rhnull blood. 
 [SCOFFS] Ethically, 
 there's no debate here, 
 regardless of medical issues. 
 We remove the pheo, then ask Jesus 
 if he still wants to move 
 forward with the donation. 
 Prep him for surgery. 
 [DR. PARK] You're trying 
 to steal our nanny? 
 Oh, Lea is trying to steal your nanny 
 because Morgan stole her first. 
 She didn't mention that part. 
 Although, Joelle was not 
 technically our nanny yet, 
 but Lea is very passionate about this, 
 and I'm choosing to support her. 
 Yeah. Me, too. 
 Oh, you're supporting Lea? 
 No. Morgan. 
 We need to do something 
 before this escalates 
 and we're ordered not 
 to talk to each other anymore. 
 We gotta sit down, 
 the four of us, and work this out. 
 Atrium Cafe. Tuesday, noon. 
 [KNOCKING ON DOOR] 
 Me again. 
 You don't have to keep checking in. 
 I, um... 
 I need a favor. 
 It's kind of a big one. 
 Due respect, Doctor, 
 the source of my divinity 
 isn't just a pheo-whatever- you-call-it. 
 Your BP and heart rate are stable. 
 Our connection to God 
 is not that easily severed. 
 I think you know that. 
 Why do you keep thinking you know me? 
 You don't. 
 You didn't know my dead friend. 
 You don't even know who you are. 
 I need to place an arterial line. 
 I know you're grieving. 
 - I don't want to talk about it. 
 - And you can't understand 
 how your friend's death 
 could be part of God's plan. 
 There is no plan. 
 It's a lie, and it's cruel. 
 And I used to believe in it so much. 
 Every time I lost a patient, 
 I would tell myself 
 it's all a part of a bigger picture. 
 I took comfort in believing 
 you were watching out for us. 
 Even in the midst of suffering, 
 you were working things out 
 for our good, 
 but it is all a lie. 
 My friend was m*rder*d 
 defending one of your children. 
 You let him bleed out 
 on the sidewalk all alone, 
 and there was no one there to 
 tell him how much he was loved. 
 He knew. 
 I promise. 
 He knew. 
 Hey. God will love you, 
 no matter what you say to Him 
 or about Him. 
 You just need to keep talking. 
 Okay, everyone, time to vote. 
 We need your help. 
 Which peak should we climb, 
 Mission Peak or Mount Umunhum? 
 Uh, Mission Peak is an easier hike, 
 but Mount Umunhum has 
 a better view of the sunset. 
 [JEROME] I vote neither. 
 [CELL PHONE BEEPS] 
 I hope that wasn't a livestream. 
 You're the disappearing nurse. 
 Jerome Martel. 
 I'm sorry about that. I, uh... 
 I lost the love of my life 
 recently, very suddenly. 
 And seeing the two of you, you know... 
 It must have struck 
 a little close to home. 
 I wish I had known my last day 
 with him was my last day. 
 Or my last month. 
 So we could have made 
 the most of that time. 
 Are you here to talk me 
 into the cordectomy? 
 Asher and I made a plan 
 to watch every Best Picture 
 winner since 1928. 
 We made it to The Godfather Part II. 
 Asher fell asleep 
 halfway through, as usual. 
 He was snoring so loudly, I could 
 hardly hear what Pacino was saying, 
 I don't know what the right 
 choice is for you and your family. 
 But I know there is nothing 
 I wouldn't give 
 to sit by Asher's side 
 and listen to him snore 
 through The English Patient. 
 Dad. We could watch every one 
 of those 30 for 30 
 documentaries you like. 
 Even the ones about hockey. 
 Or we could start our own 
 two-person true-crime book club. 
 It wouldn't just be fun and games, Eve. 
 You'd also be stuck. 
 Not stuck. 
 Honored. 
 Sure, I'd need help, 
 but I can't lose you 
 after just getting you back. 
 I want you to be there 
 when I graduate from college. 
 Maybe walk me down the aisle someday. 
 Okay if I wheel you down? 
 I'd love that. 
 We removed the pheochromocytoma. 
 Do you still believe you are Jesus? 
 [EXHALES SOFTLY] 
 My name is, um... Is Carl. 
 I remember everything, but... 
 I know I'm not Jesus. 
 Are you still willing to move forward 
 with donating your kidney? 
 I... 
 I have no idea what to do. 
 We now only have one 
 remaining bag of Rhnull blood. 
 That makes another surgery 
 quite high-risk. 
 Donating your kidney to Naomi 
 would be a very kind thing to do. 
 But as your surgeon, 
 it is not medically advisable. 
 I can't do it. 
 We've discussed and would be willing... 
 Reluctantly willing. 
 ...to hire Joelle as a part-time 
 nanny so we can all share her. 
 Returning half of what you stole? 
 What a cop-out. 
 - Told you. She's totally unreasonable. 
 - Excuse me? 
 If you want to see unreasonable, 
 let me hold up a mirror. 
 Unless you already swiped that 
 from my bag. 
 I've seen you knock-off bag. 
 There's nothing worth taking. 
 [SHAUN] Okay. 
 Would you be willing to employ her 
 on Tuesdays and Thursdays? 
 And give you a 60/40 advantage? 
 We're the ones who found her. 
 We're the ones who hired her. 
 You take Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
 I'll throw in my wine. Deal? 
 No deal, but I will give you 
 the stack of resumes 
 from the people we didn't hire. 
 So we're supposed to just 
 pick through your leftovers? 
 You already did, 
 except we were still eating her. 
 I did not mean that the way it sounded. 
 How about a 50/50 split, 
 alternating weeks? 
 I have a better idea. 
 You're a genius. 
 Savant. 
 [DR. LIM] So, St. 
 Bon's is now in the daycare business? 
 - [DR. GLASSMAN] You agreed. 
 - No, I just didn't contradict you 
 when you almost immediately said yes. 
 I'll take more 4-0 for tackups. 
 You're opposed to being family-friendly? 
 I just didn't realize your mini 
 strokes had turned you into 
 such a softy. 
 Between the daycare... and her. 
 [DR. GLASSMAN] What about her? 
 She's a patient, 
 who I happen to be right about. 
 Let's find out. 
 Opening the arachnoid. 
 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 Significant adhesions, 
 fourth ventricular veil 
 restricting CSF flow. 
 You were right. Chiari Zero.

 My, uh, emergency contact

 You want me to call him? 
 I think my, um, 
 brain tricked me into thinking I was 
 the most significant person 
 around because... 
 I don't really matter to anyone. 
 Your friend, what kind of man was he? 
 Clever. 
 Honest. 
 Would make you laugh as much as he would 
 call you out on your nonsense. 
 And really brave. 
 Maybe it wasn't a trick. 
 Maybe your brain just showed 
 you the type of person you could be. 
 Maybe you came here for a reason. 
 Yeah.

 [DR. LIM] Sutures aren't holding. 
 [JORDAN] Less than 100 cc of blood left. 
 - Can we ligate the vena cava? 
 - [SHAUN] Tissue is too friable. 
 That could cause complete renal failure. 
 We should put in a graft. 
 [DR. LIM] The walls are tearing. 
 We need something 
 to get vascular control now. 
 [JORDAN] A double-balloon occlusion. 
 We can block it from above

 Autistic children often demonstrate 
 less attachment to significant... 
 Shaun, you know a six-month-old 
 cannot be diagnosed with autism. 
 Not definitively, but it is 
 important to look for signs. 
 Which may not appear 
 for another 18 months. 
 I would still like to consult 
 a pediatric neurologist. 
 No. No matter what they say, 
 you'll still be looking for signs, 
 you'll still be trying to 
 find out what's wrong with him. 
 Not wrong. Just different. 
 You're right. I'm sorry. 
 It's just... 
 I don't want to be evaluating him 
 every time he smiles

 I just want to enjoy the magic

 Severe neck, back, and extremity pain. 
 [DR. PARK] I'm gonna feel for

 Anything that could be 
 causing this pain? 
 Well, I just spent eight months 
 on the International Space Station. 
 Whoa. Like, spacespace? 
 Yeah, I'm a botanist. 
 Studying the effects 
 of zero gravity on soybeans. 
 [SPANISH ACCENT] Selected from 
 hundreds of others for the job. 
 [DR. PARK] That could explain the pain. 
 Returning to Earth's gravity 
 puts enormous stress on the joints. 
 It was worth it. 
 He can barely walk. 
 And he's had a bunch of other 
 health problems since coming back. 
 Palpate arms and legs for pain. 
 Low gravity decreases bone mass. 
 We should do a DEXA scan 
 to assess how much he's lost.

 [SHAUN] I have seen a third thumb, 
 a third kidney, and a third nipple. 
 [JARED] Must be tough 
 for the kid, living with that. 
 [CHARLIE] Not if he learns 
 to embrace his differences. 
 [SHAUN] Do you think we should 
 get Steve tested for ASD? 
 [CHARLIE] Attempting 
 a diagnosis at Steve's age 
 will likely lead to a misdiagnosis, 
 and then you'll likely be disappointed 
 if you discover that your child 
 is just typical. 
 [JARED] Approaching bifurcation. 
 There it is. 
 Constriction coming from 
 outside the trachea. 
 [SHAUN] Something very strange 
 is going on inside Tayo's chest.

 We can discharge you now. 
 Oh. Cool.

 What are you gonna do for money? 
 Do you have any friends

 I'll be okay. 
 Uh, I just need something for the pain. 
 I can give you Tylenol. 
 No, that's not gonna be enough. 
 Hannah, you just had 
 a very successful surgery. 
 Your neuro exam 
 is completely normal now. 
 You don't need anything stronger. 
 Yes, I do. I do. 
 You just want the oxy? 
 Yeah, because I'm in pain. 
 Because you're an addict. 
 Thank you for everything.

 [MONITOR BEEPING] 
 [DOM] I-I can't believe I broke his arm. 
 [DR. PARK] Not your fault. 
 He must have lost

 [JORDAN] Do you and Morgan still need 
 me to watch Eden tomorrow morning 
 while you get married? 
 [DR. PARK] No. Because we're not 
 getting married tomorrow morning. 
 You can place the last screw. 
 [JORDAN] I don't know much 
 about weddings, 
 but it seems like agreeing on 
 a date is a prerequisite. 
 [MONITOR ALARM BEEPING] 
 [DOM] He's in V-tach and hypotensive.

 [ALARM STOPS] 
 [JORDAN] Normal sinus rhythm. 
 [DOM] Did I almost k*ll him? 
 [DR. PARK] No. 
 But we need to figure out 
 what almost did. 
 [TENSE MUSIC] 
 Tayo doesn't have asthma. 
 Because of his third arm, 
 he has an unusually large blood vessel 
 compressing his trachea 
 and constricting his air flow. 
 We placed a tracheal stent 
 to relieve the pressure, 
 but that is a temporary fix. 
 We can't remove the vessel 
 because that supplies blood 
 to both left-side arms. 
 But we can't leave it as it is 
 because he can't breathe properly. 
 We need to remove one of his arms. 
 A blood-flow test will... 
 We talked about this. 
 His big arm should go. 
 We talked. We never agreed. 
 I want to remove the little arm. 
 The big arm can't hold a pencil 
 or squeeze a hand or... 
 The little arm is not much better. 
 He doesn't want to lose 
 his little brother. 
 Without his big arm, 
 do you know how odd he will look? 
 Okay. Stop talking. 
 We need to do a Doppler ultrasound 
 to test the blood flow. 
 That is how we will choose. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 The echo showed he has 
 a dilated heart chamber. 
 It's causing arrhythmias. 
 We'll have to implant a defibrillator. 
 Is this from being in space, too? 
 [DR. PARK] Most likely. 
 In zero gravity, the heart 
 can weaken significantly. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Ana, I'm gonna be fine. 
 They warned me my body would change. 
 Not just your body. 
 Let's talk about this later. 
 Mason's been a totally different person 
 since his return. 
 I think something's off 
 with him mentally. 
 What's off about wanting 
 more time with you? 
 More time with me means I give up 
 a dream fellowship in Buenos Aires, 
 so we can both stay here 
 and take care of the children 
 you now suddenly want? 
 Being up there made me realize 
 what's important. 
 Putting down roots, starting a family. 
 So, give me a brain scan. 
 Show her this isn't 
 just some tumor talking. 
 We need a medical reason. 
 Marital disputes don't count. 
 Right now we need to implant 
 the defibrillator.

 Are you a big fan of track or something? 
 I used to be. 
 What about your folks?

 You're living on the street. 
 You're panhandling or, worse, stealing,

 I have a job at Goodwill, part-time. 
 And I probably have

 What about recovery? 
 I have it under control. 
 Well, y-you have to go to rehab. 
 You know that, right? 
 I tried quitting. It didn't work for me. 
 Because you need rehab. 
 You can't do this alone.

 Get back to Ana. 
 Turns out the thing I thought 
 would bring us closer together 
 is actually the thing 
 that may break us up. 
 Uh, did you figure out 
 what's wrong with my head? 
 You have hydrocephalus... 
 excess fluid compressing your brain. 
 A delayed reaction to being in space. 
 We have to install a shunt to drain it 
 before it damages your brain. 
 The blood flow 
 is 8% better in the little arm. 
 So we should amputate the big arm. 
 Should have done this years ago. 
 For only 8%? 
 If you are going to keep arguing, 
 we should move to 
 where Tayo can't see you. 
 He thinks he makes you unhappy. 
 And that makes him sad. 
 He said this to you? 
 Yes. 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Can we remove the big arm? 
 Yes. 
 I will schedule 
 the surgery for tomorrow. 
 Could the hydrocephalus 
 explain his personality change? 
 No. Based on his post-landing test, 
 hydrocephalus is a recent issue. 
 You know the Overview Effect... 
 what many astronauts experience 
 when they see Earth from space? 
 Is that a medical condition? 
 No, but it is a real phenomenon

 And it can be wonderful. 
 Assuming they want their life to change. 
 I don't. 
 We had a great thing.

 We flew coach, 
 we stayed at cheap, little hotels, 
 eating nothing but street food. 
 But we loved that life. 
 Seems like he's ready for more. 
 I've waited years for this fellowship.

 And what was important to me 
 used to be important to him. 
 You'll find a middle ground.

 It's okay, Shaun. 
 It's okay. 
 We need to get a diagnosis 
 from an expert in autism 
 as soon as possible. 
 Any assessment before Steve 
 is two is a waste of time. 
 I discovered a new study 
 that uses fMRI imaging 
 to identify earlier predictors 
 of autism. 
 We can't subject Steve to that. 
 An fMRI is non-invasive and harmless. 
 Not for a baby. 
 Steve would have to be sedated. 
 That is non-invasive and harmless. 
 No, Shaun, I'm not signing 
 Steve up for any study. 
 Okay. I can do it. 
 No. 
 This is not the kind of decision 
 you can make on your own. 
 Neither can you. 
 That's why we have to compromise. 
 I want to get Steve tested. 
 You do not. How can we compromise? 
 I don't know. I just... I just... 
 This... This doesn't feel right to me. 
 - Why?

 That is not a reason. 
 I will make an appointment

 My father was not supportive. 
 Mine was my biggest advocate. 
 Wouldn't it be awesome if 
 we could strip Tayo's big arm 
 to restore his little arm 
 to full capacity? 
 That would be awesome, 
 but the big arm 
 has neurological deficits 
 and atrophied muscles, so... 
 [CONTEMPLATIVE MUSIC] 
 I think we need to strip the other car! 
 I used a metaphor.

 - Hey. 
 - Hey. 
 How did things end up with Hannah? 
 Oh, she was discharged yesterday. 
 I saw. Did she agree to any 
 follow-up addiction treatment? 
 I even bought her pancakes, 
 and I couldn't get through. 
 You... You bought her breakfast? 
 More like brunch. 
 [SIGHS] You should stick 
 with the medicine 
 and let social services do the rest. 
 - I mean, there are rules for a reason. 
 - [CELL PHONE RINGS] 
 Where would Shaun be 
 if I followed the rules? 
 - Shaun wasn't your patient. 
 - Excuse me. 
 Yes, hello? 
 Okay. Where... Where are you? 
 Are you okay? 
 Okay. I'll be right there. 
 This new surgery 
 is much more complicated. 
 There is a small chance that Tayo 
 will be left with only one working arm. 
 Then that is not an option. 
 He said the risk is small. 
 But Tayo could end up worse off. 
 Or he could finally have 
 a proper-sized arm that works. 
 That is what is important 
 to you? How it looks. 
 - That is not what... 
 - Stop arguing. 
 You should ask Tayo. 
 It is his life you are fighting about. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Hey. 
 You okay? 
 It was the crappiest car ever. 
 Why... [SNIFFLES] would anyone... 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Maybe it was that sweet rear spoiler. 
 [LAUGHS, SOBS] 
 Hey, I know a-a shelter on Lexington. 
 It's clean, it's secure. 
 No, I have a friend I can stay with. 
 I just need a ride. 
 You were right. 
 And as humiliating as that was, 
 I deserved it. 
 But I am taking this seriously. 
 In World w*r I, 
 my great-grandfather survived 
 a winter in the trenches. 
 He met this lovely French farm woman. 
 They fell in love. 
 When they were married, 
 my great-grandmother gave him this ring. 
 And now I want to give it to you. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Will you marry me? 
 For real. 
 I'm not gonna do 
 the whole knee thing again. 
 Yes. I will.

 That's incredible. 
 It would be, except that it 
 actually says ""Bunny Hearts Irv."" 
 And let me rephrase... 
 No, I won't. 
 I spent my lunch hour at a pawnshop 
 so you could feel romantic 
 about your second marriage. 
 Well, maybe if my first marriage 
 had been a bit more romantic, 
 I wouldn't need a second one. 
 Oh! [GROANS] 
 I'm sleeping in the guest room tonight. 
 I sleep better without you anyway! 
 I could lose my big arm too? 
 Unlikely, but possible. 
 Your mother and I fight far too much. 
 But it is because we both 
 care so much about you. 
 More than anything else in the world. 
 But I know it makes you sad, 
 and that breaks my heart. 
 I am sorry, Tayo. 
 What do you want to do? 
 Hmm? 
 You're a big boy. 
 We want to hear what you think. 
 I don't want to say goodbye 
 to my little brother. 
 But I know he'll understand.

 Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hannah? 
 Hey. Look... 
 I have a-a very comfortable 
 couch in my living room. 
 Nobody's using it. 
 What do you think? 
 [SOMBER MUSIC] 
 Good morning. 
 Morning. 
 I wasn't lying about the couch, was I? 
 You were not. 
 Payback. 
 Fantastic. 
 Unnecessary, but... 
 The key is adding the chips by hand 
 after the batter's already on the grill. 
 That way, there's no weird 
 clumps of chocolate. 
 I like to pay my own way. 
 Uh, there's a guy at work 
 who said he'll rent me 
 a room in his house. 
 I'm checking it out today. 
 You know what? 
 I can get you a bed 
 in the St. Bons rehab unit. 
 When I tried to quit, 
 it was the worst week of my life. 
 Hmm. 
 Well, you can always stay here 
 until you get back on your feet. 
 I don't feel good putting you out. 
 It wouldn't put me out. You just... 
 Couch is right there. 
 You can earn your keep in pancakes. 
 I guess I could stay one more night. 
 I'll even restock the chocolate chips. 
 [GENTLE MUSIC] 
 Is he okay? 
 When he was in space, 
 his brain shifted 
 due to the microgravity, 
 and now it's shifting back and 
 blocking the flow of the shunt. 
 And we need to remove a piece 
 of the skull to relieve the pressure. 
 Could he die? 
 This is a risky surgery. 
 But it's our best shot. 
 We need your consent. 
 Thank you. 
 [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 Oh, God, and then I lost it, 
 and then Shaun lost it. 
 Now he's totally dug in, 
 but there's no way I'm gonna 
 let Steve do this study, 
 but he's being so unreasonable. 
 Why are you so worried about this study? 
 It's way too early 
 for Steve to be tested. 
 And no matter what happens, 
 it'll label him. 
 And that's what you're 
 worried about, being labeled? 
 Once that happens, 
 he'll be seen as different. 
 - By whom? 
 - By everyone. 
 Since when are you 
 so concerned about everyone? 
 Since I became a mom? I don't know. I... 
 How can I not? 
 You're a new parent. That's scary. 
 But how often do we make the 
 right decision when we're scared?

 - Look at the little cheeks. 
 - I know. 
 How are things at Centro de Salud? 
 Great. 
 I've managed to make a ton of 
 improvements since you were there. 
 Did you get a new CT machine? 
 Yeah, and an MRI. 
 Also, we opened a prenatal clinic, 
 and I've instituted a bunch of protocols 
 to decrease Hospital 
 Acquired Infections. 
 And on the personal front? 
 Uh... that is a work in progress. 
 But good. 
 I told Lea about 
 the lump in your breast. 
 It was before I convinced you 
 to have your surgery here. 
 Not a HIPAA violation. 
 I hope you also told her 
 that the biopsy was negative. 
 It's not cancer, so there's 
 nothing to worry about. 
 He did. I reserve the right to worry. 
 But let's save the medicine for later 
 and focus on more important 
 stuff like Latin lovers. 
 Oh. Oh, is that banana bread? 
 That smells amazing. 
 Resistance is futile.

 That was a nice start to the day. 
 A fantastic start.

 least wear something special. 
 We can't get married at City Hall. 
 - Alex, we've been over this. 
 - I know. 
 And you say you don't care 
 where we get married. 
 - I don't.

 wedding to be special like I do. 
 I don't want to delay our adoption.

 you have to focus on today. 
 I know. I'm gonna get clean.

 professional treatment... 
 No.

 And it's the only way forward. 
 No, it's not. I don't want methadone. 
 I hate meetings

 So we'll find you 
 a program that works for you, 
 but getting sober is the point. 
 It's the only point. 
 You can't make this a solo act.

 Shaun, I was being nice. 
 You could try harder to do the same. 
 - Thank you, Dr. Brown. 
 - Oh, call me Claire. 
 Okay, I'm sure the new MRI 
 you acquired is excellent, 
 but we should do a stereotactic biopsy 
 and breast MRI. 
 Instead of a mammogram? 
 New research shows that breast MRI 
 are more accurate for younger women 
 with denser breast tissue. 
 I was about to say that. 
 Sorry, I'm working on 
 controlling my impulsive speech. 
 It just seems you're eager 
 to demonstrate your knowledge 
 as med students are supposed to do. 
 Thank you, Dr. Brown. I mean, Claire. 
 Now you are being too nice.

 want to seem ostentatious. 
 Mm. 
 No, I'm happy you've 
 stopped worrying so much

 and we went over your MRI together.

 Ooh. Tell me about being

 Mm. It's been interesting. 
 Collaborative. 
 By collaborative, 
 you mean you get stuff done, 
 and then he tells you how 
 you should have gotten it done? 
 Oh, you have one of those in Guatemala? 
 - Just one? I wish. 
 - [BOTH LAUGH] 
 - Oh, I miss the old days. 
 - Mm. 
 You mean when you were

 Hey, I do not need 
 a Ducati to be a badass.

 - More sleep? 
 - I was thinking more sex, 
 but sleep is good. 
 Tell me about it. Sometimes I 
 wonder if I... 
 - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] 
 - Hold that thought. 
 [SIGHS] 
 - To be continued. 
 - I'll be here. 
 Hey, we need to talk. 
 Hello, I need to get Claire 
 prepped for her surgery. 
 There's a girl living 
 in Glassman's apartment. 
 She says her name is Hannah 
 and claims she's his niece. 
 He does not have a niece named Hannah. 
 I know, but she had a key 
 and her clothes were there. 
 He had a patient last week named Hannah. 
 She was a homeless drug addict 
 who needed cervicomedullary surgery. 
 Why would he let a homeless 
 drug addict live with him? 
 I... 
 don't know. 
 - [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] 
 - I have to go. 
 The MRI confirmed the mass 
 is under 2 centimeters. 
 That's only Stage 1A. 
 With your hormone profile, 
 you should be responsive 
 to hormone therapy after the surgery. 
 You probably won't need chemo. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Do you disagree? 
 No. 
 Tell me if you do. 
 I'd rather get the bad news now. 
 I agree completely. 
 I was just thinking about someone else. 
 But I will be focused in the OR. 
 [GROANS] 
 Another 10 milligrams morphine. 
 [LIM] Sorry. 
 I just need to remove 
 the necrotic skin and tissue 
 to avoid infection. 
 That's okay. 
 It hurts 'cause I'm alive. 
 Never taking that for granted again. 
 Good for you. 
 I never should have even 
 started working construction. 
 [GRUNTS] 
 [LIM] Take a couple deep breaths. 
 Maybe just not outside 
 during a thunderstorm. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I used to have a band. 
 Even put out a couple EPs, 
 but we just couldn't break out. 
 I got a day job, turned 30. 
 Next thing I know, 
 I'm a foreman for a roofing company. 
 Sometimes, big decisions are 
 just a bunch of small ones 
 you don't even realize you made. 
 I just feel like I should recommit. 
 You know, I could eke out a 
 living playing clubs and bars. 
 I'd rather look in the mirror 
 and know... 
 I'm the person I want to be. 
 [SHAUN] A curvilinear incision 
 along the natural crease line 
 of the breast 
 gives the best cosmetic result. 
 Who were you thinking about? 
 You told Claire you were 
 thinking about someone else. 
 I shouldn't talk about it. 
 Raising the flap with 
 a wide margin around the mass. 
 Did I say something inappropriate? 
 I wasn't thinking about you. 
 - Was it... 
 - Charlie. 
 He said he doesn't want 
 to talk about it. 
 Send this to pathology. 
 The tissue orientation 
 is marked with ink at 12:00. 
 Dr. Kalu, your suture spacing 
 is quite excellent. 
 You can close. 
 Suture with vicryls 
 and monocryl, please. 
 Is the Hannah who's living with you 
 the same Hannah 
 you treated for Chiari Zero? 
 Yes. 
 Seven ball, corner pocket. 
 Sh-She is a drug addict. 
 Who I am helping. 
 Helping her detox? 
 She's a patient under my care, Shaun. 
 That's all you need to know. 
 If she's a patient, 
 that means you are 
 continuing to treat her 
 while she is living with you. 
 - How? 
 - Shaun... 
 Are you prescribing her opiates? 
 I'm helping her get sober. 
 I can't have her go out 
 on the street and buy dr*gs. 
 Prescribing her oxycodone 
 in this situation is unethical. 
 - I'm aware. 
 - And possibly illegal. 
 - I'm aware. 
 - You could lose your medical license. 
 You need to make her leave. 
 I'm not giving up on her. 
 But thank you for your concern.

 Over four minutes. 
 - Then give four milligrams lorazepam. 
 - Already did. 
 Then give four more 
 and one gram levetiracetam. 
 [BLARING CONTINUES] 
 He's got a mass in his frontal lobe. 
 - Could it be from the lightning strike? 
 - No. 
 In fact, the lightning probably saved 
 his life, putting him in the hospital. 
 He has that seizure anywhere 
 else, he'd probably be dead. 
 A supramaximal resection 
 might get at all. 
 - If we're lucky. 
 - And if we're not? 
 It'll likely progress 
 to a glioblastoma and k*ll him. 
 [PARK] We had our first 
 official date here. 
 She jumped on stage 
 and tried to join Cory Henry's 
 backup singers. 
 She loves music, 
 and this would be the perfect place. 
 Yeah, I'd love to help you, 
 but I got bands booked every night. 
 Couldn't you reschedule one? 
 I-I'll pay their fee, 
 cover whatever the difference 
 ends up being in your gate. 
 I mean, name your price. 
 Sorry. 
 But I think you're gonna have 
 to choose between immediate 
 and meaningful. 
 The glioma is 
 in your posterior frontal lobe 
 near the motor strip. 
 We have to be very aggressive. 
 If we leave any tumor behind, 
 it could grow back as a glioblastoma, 
 which could be terminal. 
 Okay. 
 Because of the placement of the tumor, 
 we may need to cut 
 into your eloquent cortex, 
 the area of your brain 
 which controls motor function. 
 Are you saying 
 I won't be able to play guitar? 
 It's possible. 
 Alive is alive. 
 I'll take it. 
 I am going to tell Dr. Lim 
 about Dr. Glassman and Hannah. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 He'd probably consider it 
 an even worse betrayal 
 than when you ended his surgical career. 
 I was right about that, 
 and I am right about this, too. 
 He could lose his medical license. 
 I am saving him. 
 Shaun, I don't think it's just 
 about helping a former patient. 
 What else is it about? 
 You know why he helped 
 you back in Wyoming? 
 Because he knew I needed help. 
 Of course. 
 Also... his daughter had just died. 
 He was grieving. 
 Maybe he did for you 
 what he couldn't do for her. 
 What does that have to do with Hannah? 
 Hannah's a drug addict, 
 just like Maddie was. 
 I think some of this is 
 Glassman dealing with his sense 
 that he failed his daughter. 
 After everything 
 he's done to support you, 
 don't you think you should 
 let him help Hannah? 
 Dr. Glassman... is only putting 
 himself at risk, 
 which I guess is okay. 
 I won't tell Dr. Lim. 
 Okay. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'm thinking an awake craniotomy 
 with intraoperative motor brain mapping. 
 Respiratory failure leads 
 to brain edema and herniation, 
 air embolism, intraop seizures, 
 just to name a few of the risks. 
 He was struck by lightning 
 and remembered who he was. 
 A guitarist. 
 I don't want to take that away from him. 
 Big swing. 
 I think I'm gonna do it. 
 You seem amped up about this. 
 It suits you. 
 You need to keep him playing 
 guitar during the surgery. 
 If his playing gets worse 
 during motor mapping, 
 then you can't cut into that area. 
 If he keeps playing well, 
 then it's safe to cut. 
 Digale a Dr. Maldonado 
 que cubra esos turnos... 
 Esperemos la semana que viene. 
 Me tengo que ir. 
 Gracias, Imelda. 
 Your pathology just came back. 
 We didn't get clean margins. 
 Now, you're already on 
 the board for this afternoon. 
 We'll perform a re-excision, 
 removing a wider margin 
 of the breast tissue, 
 followed by a sentinel lymph node biopsy 
 to see if it's spread. 
 But... 
 [SIGHS] 
 ...if it has... 
 ...well, then, who better 
 to take this on? 
 You grew up in a trailer park. 
 You were raised by a bipolar mother. 
 Went to a top med school on scholarship. 
 Then you were recruited to be 
 chief of surgery in a country 
 where you didn't even know the language. 
 Now, two years later, you, uh... 
 you speak perfect Spanish and 
 you've overhauled the hospital. 
 You are an unstoppable force, 
 Claire Browne. 
 And on top of all of that, 
 you are kind, compassionate, 
 and [CHUCKLES] heart-stoppingly 
 beautiful. 
 Cancer doesn't stand 
 a chance against you. 
 Forgot how great your bedside manner is. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 And my Spanish is far from perfect. 
 Play guitar during surgery? 
 The risk of complications is higher, 
 but an awake surgery is the only way 
 to ensure full post-op function 
 of your fine motor skills. 
 We test each resection area 
 and get immediate feedback 
 before removing any tissue. 
 And won't it hurt? 
 You won't even feel it. 
 Any song requests? 
 Thank you for coming. 
 So, what does she want? 
 She doesn't want anything. 
 She doesn't know I'm here. 
 I want your help. I'd like to 
 stage an intervention for Hannah. 
 You think we haven't 
 tried that... multiple times? 
 Well, let's try again. 
 Your daughter needs your help. 
 What do you know about my daughter? 
 She came to me with Chiari Zero. 
 That is a malformation of the brain 
 which causes persistent and 
 sometimes very intense pain. 
 That's why she started on the oxycodone. 
 Can that be treated? 
 My colleague already performed surgery. 
 It was a complete success. 
 She had brain surgery? 
 Is she still in the hospital? 
 She's staying on my couch. 
 It was there or the streets. 
 So she's using in your home? 
 Yes, under my supervision. 
 I wrote her a prescription 
 for oxycodone, 
 which I'm administering on a schedule. 
 You're her new drug dealer. 
 Her first night in my apartment, 
 she OD'd on fentanyl... 
 fentanyl that she bought on the street. 
 Street dr*gs right now 
 are Russian roulette. 
 What I'm doing is much safer. 
 I could call the cops on you. 
 Do you know that? 
 Tell me something... 
 is it just the dr*gs? 
 Are you also sleeping with her? 
 If I were doing that, 
 would I be calling you? 
 Can we please stop 
 with the nonsense now? 
 I'm trying to save her life. 
 The only way she turns this around 
 is if she hits rock bottom. 
 - Rock bottom. 
 - Mm-hmm. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 I kicked my daughter out of my house. 
 And I told her, ""Do not come back 
 until you're clean and sober."" 
 The next time I saw her was 
 on the coroner's table. 
 Well, I'm very sorry. 
 But Hannah is not your daughter. 
 And the only person 
 that can save Hannah is Hannah. 
 But she has to want the help. 
 And that's never gonna happen 
 as long as you keep enabling her. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 I heard your second surgery 
 was boring... 
 just the way we like them. 
 [SIGHS] I'm still a little sore. 
 That's why I brought this. 
 Oh, thank you. 
 Oh, yeah, that is much better. 
 Bless you. 
 Now, show me that baby. 
 Oh, she is gorgeous. 
 The spitting image of Winston Churchill. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 - She, too, will one day rule an empire. 
 - Park looks so happy to be her dad. 
 - Doesn't he? 
 And as soon as we get married, 
 we can finalize the adoption 
 and make it official. 
 Way to bury the lede! Congrats. 
 When's the big day? 
 Sometime this week, actually. 
 - Do you want to come? 
 - Absolutely. 
 Oh, I'm just glad that Park is making 
 an honest woman out of you. 
 Me, too. 
 I can't believe how close I 
 came to letting him get away. 
 - [HANNAH] Hi. 
 - Hi. 
 I'm making Coq au vin. 
 I found a bottle of Burgundy 
 in the cabinet. 
 I hope you don't mind. 
 We're celebrating. 
 Celebrating? 
 What are we celebrating? 
 I got a job... 
 at L'Amour, as a hostess, 
 but it's one of the best 
 restaurants in the city, 
 and I can work my way up. 
 Wow. That is amazing. 
 I am very, very proud of you. 
 Thank you. 
 I'm proud of me, too. 
 - Mmm. 
 - [ALARM BEEPS] 
 Oh. Time for your pill. 
 Um, after my shower. 
 This has to simmer 
 for 30 minutes, anyway. 
 [DOOR SLIDES CLOSED] 
 - Those aren't mine. 
 - Please don't lie to me. 
 I found them in your jeans. 
 Why were you going through my stuff? 
 Well, obviously, 
 I can't trust you, can I? 
 I want to get clean. I do. I just... 
 You're making me go too fast. 
 We're gonna get you treatment. 
 I'm gonna take you, 
 and we're gonna go, and... 
 No, I told you, I'm not going to rehab. 
 It doesn't work! 
 - It's the only thing that does work! 
 - I'm outta here. 
 I'm gonna flush it 
 - right down the toilet. 
 - Stop. What are you doing? 
 That's mine. Stop it. 
 - I paid for those. Stop it. 
 - Too bad. 
 - There you go. 
 - [TOILET FLUSHES] 
 Okay? 
 This is your fault! 
 How could you think giving me more pills 
 was gonna help me get clean?! 
 How is it my fault? 
 I'm giving you too many dr*gs 
 or I'm making you kick too fast... 
 Which is it? It can't be both. 
 I hate you! 
 - No, you don't. 
 - Yes, I do! 
 I hate you. I got to go. 
 - You can't leave. 
 - Like hell, I can't. 
 If you leave, you're g... 
 you're gonna end up dead. 
 Is that what you want? 
 This isn't working. 
 - I have to go. 
 - Okay. Alright. Alright. 
 Alright, alright. 
 [DOOR CLOSES] 
 Your pathology report 
 hasn't come back yet. 
 Oh, that wasn't why I, um... 
 why I texted. 
 What's been on your mind? 
 You're not very good 
 at keeping secrets, Shaun. 
 I... can't tell you. 
 - Do you want to? 
 - Yes, I think you could help. 
 I've never betrayed your trust. 
 Dr. Glassman is prescribing oxycodone 
 to a teenage drug addict 
 who is living with him. 
 He says he isn't concerned 
 about losing his medical license 
 or going to jail, but he should be. 
 If I don't understand his decisions, 
 how can I stop him from making bad ones? 
 Oh. [EXHALES SHARPLY] 
 When I was a kid, I... 
 I didn't even ask why my mom used. 
 I was too busy trying to survive. 
 But now, I think what my mom needed most 
 was one thing in her life 
 without an ""if"" attached. 
 With addicts, 
 everything becomes conditional. 
 A home, a job, even love. 
 They only get them if they get clean. 
 Dr. Glassman told Maddie 
 she could only come home 
 if she got sober. 
 Then she died. 
 The ""if"" k*lled her. 
 The dr*gs k*lled her. 
 And a car accident k*lled my mom, but... 
 ...sometimes I can't help but feel 
 if I'd told her 
 I loved her unconditionally... 
 she would still be alive. 
 So, Dr. Glassman 
 needs to keep giving Hannah 
 unconditional love, 
 even if it risks his career? 
 I think so. 
 And if I want to help Dr. Glassman, 
 I need to help Hannah. 
 How? 
 I-I'm sorry, Shaun. I don't know. 
 But if someone told me 
 the day we met outside, 
 when you were soaking wet, 
 barely able to communicate, 
 that you would become a top attending, 
 a wonderful husband and father, 
 I wouldn't have believed them. 
 But you have grown so much. 
 You're really, really good 
 at helping people, Shaun. 
 You're gonna figure out how to help. 
 I've missed this. 
 Me, too. 
 Ojemann stimulator. 
 [GUITAR PLAYING] 
 Beginning motor mapping. 
 No motor arrest. 
 Mark area one safe for resection. 
 [PLAYING STOPS] 
 Area two not safe for resection. 
 Are you okay, Clint? 
 I think so. 
 Can you keep playing? 
 [GUITAR PLAYING] 
 Continuing motor mapping. 
 Totally clean margins, 
 lymph node negative, 
 no more surgeries. 
 You are good to go. 
 Oh, that is fantastic. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Oh, thank you. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I'm so glad I got to see you again. 
 Me, too. 
 Seems like you're back where you belong. 
 I wasn't gonna come back. 
 I, um... 
 I-I told Shaun 
 that I'd just get 
 the lumpectomy in Guatemala, 
 and then he told me 
 that you would be here. 
 You know, since being back, 
 I, um, think about you all the time. 
 Not like I didn't before, but... 
 I don't know why 
 I couldn't commit to you. 
 I think I was just young, stubborn. 
 It's okay. 
 We got all of it. 
 You'll need to do some radiotherapy, 
 but it shouldn't interfere 
 with your music career. 
 Well, I'm not sure 
 any crowd will compare 
 to playing with my brain exposed. 
 Thank you so much. 
 You look upset, 
 like you have been crying. 
 Are you okay? 
 No. 
 Hannah bought pills on the street. 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I can't help her. I tried. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I-I don't want to... 
 [SOBS] 
 I don't want to fight anymore. 
 Do you want me to stay with you? 
 No. 
 [SIGHS] I'm gonna go for a walk. 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 Who are you? 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 Dr. Glassman's... son. 
 Not biologically. 
 Dr. Glassman helped me 
 like he's helping you. 
 So, basically, we're both broken toys 
 that are supposed to replace 
 the daughter he couldn't fix? 
 Dr. Glassman didn't fix me. 
 He loved me. 
 I'm not like other people. 
 Other kids called me weird. 
 My parents didn't want me. 
 So, that was how I saw myself. 
 But Dr. Glassman saw 
 that I could be more. 
 And now I see myself as so much more 
 because Dr. Glassman loved me... 
 ...unconditionally. 
 I am still different. 
 I will... always have autism, 
 but now I'm proud of that. 
 You will always be an addict, 
 even if you stop using dr*gs. 
 But Dr. Glassman sees you can be more. 
 Why can't you? 
 Mm. It's after midnight. 
 I know. 
 Joelle's on her way to babysit. 
 Why? 
 I borrowed your favorite dress, 
 gave it to the dressmaker, 
 so she'd have the right size. 
 I haven't looked. 
 I'm not supposed to see it until later. 
 We're getting married now? 
 the perfect venue was available. 
 Idle Time Jazz Bar, where we... 
 Had our first official date. 
 You're amazing. 
 I'm glad you're here. 
 I know I'll always be an addict. 
 But I'd like to be more. 
 I know I need rehab. 
 I'd really like it... 
 if you could still be here for me... 
 ...after rehab. 
 Like you were for Dr. Murphy. 
 As long as I'm here, 
 I'll be here for you. 
 We have to find you the right program. 
 I am a president of a hospital, 
 so I should be able to pull 
 some strings. 
 Mr. Big Shot. 
 You better believe it. 
 To always support 
 your boundless ambitions. 
 To never complain, 
 no matter how many times 
 you make me listen 
 to the same show tunes. 
 And most of all, I... 
 I vow to be the man and the father 
 and the best friend you and Eden need. 
 Always. 
 Well, I think I was the last person 
 that knew we were 
 getting married tonight, 
 so I didn't write any vows. 
 But the truth is that I will never be 
 as romantic or as sweet as you are. 
 But I will never stop loving you. 
 Or stop teasing you 
 because I know it turns you on. 
 [ALL CHUCKLE]

 Hannah told me about your talk. 
 Her parents are taking her 
 to rehab tomorrow. 
 Thank you. 
 You're welcome. 
 You have grown... a lot. 
 As a doctor, as a father, as a man. 
 Thank you. I have. 
 My cancer is back. 
 It's progressed to a glioblastoma. 
 There are... new experimental... 
 No, no, no, no, no, no. 
 It's terminal. 
 I'm dying. 
 [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 Amir will be here in a minute 
 to take you to your hotel. 
 Or we could go back to your place. 
 I can't. 
 Not if it's gonna be a one-night stand. 
 It's not gonna be a one-night stand. 
 Oh. 
 You okay? 
 Oh, yeah. I just feel a little bit sick. 
 Yeah, you feel warm. 
 You didn't drink anything, did you? 
 No, because of the medication. 
 Claire? 
 Claire? Clai... 
 [AMIR] Hi. Are you Jared? 
 St. Bonaventure, 
 as fast as you can drive. 
 [CLOSING THEME MUSIC PLAYING]"
,6470478,7,10,"[LEA] How long have you known? 
 [SIGHS] 
 About a week or two. 
 My doctor found it on the yearly scan. 
 [STEVEN BABBLING] 
 Did they give you a sense of how long? 
 - Three to six. 
 - Years? 
 Months. 
 What's your plan? 
 Is there a surgery or chemo? 
 No. This is my plan right here. 
 You. You're it. 
 You're the plan. 
 And you. 
 And that one. 
 And maybe some bowling. 
 I have to go to work. 
 Last time, you also said 
 it was inoperable. Goodbye. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 He just took your medical file. 
 Yeah. 
 I'm so sorry, Glassy. 
 Me too. 
 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] 
 Despite having you on 
 vancomycin and ceftriaxone, 
 your post-op infection 
 is still progressing. 
 We're waiting for 
 the cultures to grow out, 
 but we suspect MRSA. 
 I'm thinking we debride 
 the infected tissue, 
 then flush antibiotics 
 directly into the wound 
 and put in drains. 
 Good call. 
 I'll put it on the schedule, 
 and leave you two alone. 
 I guess we weren't exactly subtle. 
 No. 
 You said you wanted more 
 than a one-night stand. 
 I did. 
 But, uh, 
 how would we do that? 
 I don't know. 
 But... 
 I would like to make it work. 
 Me too. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 [PAGER BUZZES] 
 Oh, it's Shaun. He wants me in 
 the Residents' Lounge, stat. 
 The patient is a 68-year-old man 
 diagnosed with grade IV 
 butterfly glioblastoma, 
 from the left frontotemporal lobe. 
 Do we have a full medical record? 
 Patient history? 
 Or a name? 
 Successful surgical resection 
 for glioma five years ago, 
 followed by chemo and radiation. 
 And within the past year, 
 several minor strokes. 
 Glioma and strokes. 
 Are those Glassman's? 
 His cancer's back? 
 The patient's identity 
 isn't medically relevant. 
 How is he? How are you, Shaun? 
 The patient's identity 
 isn't medically relevant. 
 Shaun, did Dr. Glassman 
 ask you to develop a treatment? 
 No, he didn't. Otherwise, he'd be here. 
 The patient is reluctant 
 to pursue treatment, 
 but the patient is also 
 not aware of new developments. 
 You and Jordan go do 
 Claire's debridement. 
 I'm sorry, Shaun. I can't. 
 Looking at the axial images 
 with contrast... 
 How's Claire? 
 Looks like MRSA. We've got her 
 on vanc and ceftriaxone. 
 Rack 'em up. 
 Said the woman who 
 hates the fact that there's 
 a pool table in the president's lounge 
 to a dying man? 
 Shaun? 
 He's got a group brainstorming 
 a treatment plan for you. 
 - I'll rejoin them if you want me to. 
 - No. 
 Thank you. 
 Hey, look at the bright side. 
 When I'm gone, no more co-presidency. 
 You can run this joint however you want. 
 I never wanted it in the first place. 
 Stop. You're a natural. 
 Even if you are overly invested 
 and too accessible... 
 In every other way, you're amazing. 
 This sucks. 
 Shut up and rack 'em. 
 [JARED] No sign of any more 
 devascularized tissue. 
 [JORDAN] Proceeding with 
 antibiotic irrigation. 
 Looked like you two were 
 reconnecting last night. 
 [JARED] Yeah. 
 Did that... Does that bother you? 
 It caught me off guard a little. 
 You could have told me you two 
 had unfinished business. 
 You're with Perez. 
 Danny and I are texting a lot, 
 and, yes, I do hope and pray 
 my future is with him. 
 That's why I backed off 
 and stopped flirting with you. 
 You and me, we're friends. 
 Placing the drain. 
 Thing about friends is, no holding out. 
 I told you about me and Danny, 
 you tell me 
 when your ex you're not over 
 is back in town. 
 I can close. 
 Deal. 
 To both. 
 I'll go check on the cultures, 
 see which antibiotics are working. 
 Shaun, have you tried calling 
 the Tisch Brain Tumor Center 
 or Cleveland Clinic about 
 their in-progress GBM trials? 
 That is an excellent idea. 
 I'll keep things rolling here. 
 Come on, guys, I need some energy, 
 some enthusiasm. 
 Stop pitching the same idea. 
 Start pitching any idea. 
 I ran out an hour ago. 
 How long are we supposed 
 to keep doing this? 
 Until Shaun accepts 
 what we already know. 
 That there is no treatment. 
 - What do you got? 
 - Nothing's working. 
 Not a single antibiotic made 
 a dent in Claire's infection. 
 It's not MRSA. 
 We cleared out all the infected tissue, 
 but initial cultures confirm 
 you don't have MRSA. 
 You have acinetobacter. 
 It's resistant to everything. 
 One of the antibiotic combos 
 slowed growth a little. 
 We'll try that. 
 But mostly, we need your 
 immune system to beat this thing. 
 Are you scared? 
 I heard about Glassman. 
 How's he holding up? 
 Better than the rest of us, I think. 
 At least, he's acting like it. 
 Congratulations. 
 I assume they'll 
 offer you the presidency. 
 - [SCOFFS] 
 - Look, 
 it is a terrible way to get the offer, 
 but it is still a huge accomplishment. 
 [SIGHS] There's another offer. 
 Chief of surgery at the hospital 
 where Clay's doing 
 his fellowship in Chicago. 
 I'd get to focus on surgery again, 
 be with Clay again. 
 But? 
 How did you know it was the right choice 
 to move to Guatemala? 
 It made me want to throw up. 
 [BOTH CHUCKLE] 
 It was so terrifying. 
 But in an exhilarating kind of way. 
 What? 
 You're sweating. 
 [KNOCK ON DOOR] 
 I'm looking for stuff to scavenge. 
 Oh, well, help yourself. 
 Just stay away from the scotch. 
 I'm gonna need that. 
 Tell me about your bucket list. 
 Bucket list? Hmm. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 Criss-cross the Serengeti with 
 a backpack and a pitch tent. 
 Wrestle an alligator and win. 
 Or go bowling. 
 I didn't take you for a Pin Prince. 
 A bowler? 
 I'm kind of a Strike Siren myself. 
 Park and I are in a league. 
 I wasn't expecting that. 
 I know what I want. 
 When you were treating 
 my rheumatoid arthritis, 
 there was this 
 one day when you were going over my 
 X-rays and blood work 
 and medical history, 
 all this stupid paperwork 
 about me and my stupid hands, 
 and it all felt so overwhelming. 
 And then you gathered it up 
 into this nice, neat pile, 
 and you paper-clipped it together. 
 And all of a sudden, 
 it felt manageable, like, 
 maybe I would be okay. 
 Also, I can use it to jimmy open 
 the filing cabinet in my office. 
 I can't find the key. 
 Thank you. 
 I sense you've cracked it. 
 No, we've made no progress at all. 
 Shaun, we've been at this all day. 
 It's only 3:15. 
 We've been at this for over seven hours, 
 with six people looking non-stop. 
 If there was a miracle cure to find, 
 - I think we would've... 
 - I found something! 
 A maximal resection 
 would debulk the tumor 
 down to a one-centimeter margin. 
 Minimally invasive techniques 
 could be used. 
 You would only be in the 
 hospital for one to two nights, 
 and overall recovery would be faster 
 because they wouldn't be 
 operating in the brain stem. 
 [CHARLIE] The surgery would be followed 
 by an experimental ultrasound therapy. 
 Thank you. An experimental 
 ultrasound therapy, 
 breaking down the blood-brain barrier 
 to increase chemo penetration, 
 allowing for a lower dose. 
 There would still be some side effects, 
 but we could take more edibles together 
 and eat Mallomars. Mm. 
 It could give you as much as a year. 
 Maybe more, if you respond well. 
 [CELLPHONE VIBRATES] 
 Claire is in septic shock. I have to go. 
 I will be back later 
 to answer any questions. 
 [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] 
 [DR. LIM] Temp's 103. 
 BP's low, cardiac output is declining. 
 We could do another wound debridement. 
 It's in her blood. The wound is 
 not the biggest issue anymore. 
 But clearing it out 
 allows her immune system 
 to focus its resources elsewhere. 
 Not enough. We could try 
 a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. 
 [CLAIRE] Guys. 
 We all know the answer. 
 You have to put me in a coma. 
 - No. 
 - We're not there yet. 
 We are. 
 Shutting down your 
 other metabolic demands 
 will allow your body to focus 
 on fighting the infection. 
 I know, once you put me under, 
 that may be... 
 But this is my best chance 
 to beat this thing. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Hey. 
 Have you looked over the materials? 
 I highlighted relevant sections. 
 I have, and I appreciate 
 what you're trying to do, Shaun. 
 Yes. It is a very good plan. 
 I'm not going to do it. 
 I don't want to spend my 
 remaining days sick and in pain. 
 I might not be able to talk normally. 
 I might not be able to walk normally. 
 I'll have memory loss. 
 Oh, there is a less than 20% chance. 
 I don't want to take that chance. 
 But it could give you more time. 
 A year, maybe, 
 and in and out of hospitals 
 half the time. 
 Or, Shaun, 
 or I could do nothing 
 and have six good months. 
 I could spend those good months 
 with you and Lea 
 and Steve. 
 [TIMER RINGING] 
 [TIMER RINGING] 
 Please don't touch anything. 
 Glassman rejected the plan. 
 His three concerns were 
 impairment of motor and speech, 
 loss of memory, 
 side effects of the chemo. 
 I just need to find ways 
 to mitigate those risks. 
 You are just standing there. 
 You are here to tell me to stop working 
 on Dr. Glassman's case. 
 No, Shaun. 
 It's your choice. 
 [TIMER RINGING] 
 The rocuronium will 
 temporarily paralyze you 
 to make intubation easier. 
 Once the tube is in, we'll do 
 a continuous propofol drip. 
 You ready? 
 [SNIFFLES] 
 I forgot a med. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 I can't say goodbye. 
 Just got you back. 
 I love you. 
 I... 
 I'm so sorry 
 we lost so much time. 
 Hey. 
 We needed that time to get back here. 
 We weren't ready before. 
 - We were too dumb. 
 - [LAUGHS] 
 We were so dumb. 
 [GASPS SOFTLY] 
 But I did tell you 
 that I think, one day, 
 we'd both be very happy. 
 I just didn't realize 
 it would be together. 
 I love you, too, Claire Browne. 
 [EXHALES] 
 And I really wish 
 I could kiss you right now. 
 Where is Shaun? 
 Claire's asking for you. 
 I am working on her case. 
 Currently, I'm working 
 on Dr. Glassman's, 
 but I will switch back 
 in 3 minutes and 27 seconds. 
 She might not wake up, Shaun. 
 She wants to say goodbye. 
 I will find a way to save them both. 
 Oncolytic viruses 
 have been used to infect 
 and destroy cancer cells, 
 but the viruses won't work 
 because Dr. Glassman's tumor 
 was previously EGFR negative... 
 - Shaun. 
 - ...so there is no target 
 for the virus to attach to, 
 but if I could find 
 - a different receptor... 
 - Shaun. 
 Your very good friend, who might die, 
 is asking for 
 a few minutes of your time, 
 but you're too busy ignoring 
 the expressed wishes 
 of your other friend who's dying. 
 I know you're scared. 
 But you're being a bad friend 
 when the people you love 
 could really use a good one. 
 I know how to save Claire. 
 Hello. We can use viruses 
 to cure Claire's bacterial infection. 
 Bacteriophages, to be precise. 
 They are viruses 
 that attack and infiltrate 
 only bacteria, and then 
 destroy them from the inside. 
 Every bacteriophage only 
 infects certain kinds of bacteria. 
 All we need to do is find one 
 that will attack Claire's infection. 
 There are billions of phages. 
 Are any of them known 
 to work on acinetobacter? 
 - No. 
 - [JORDAN] So, we're searching 
 through a billion haystacks 
 for one needle? 
 [SHAUN] Not exactly. 
 Each phage can attack 
 more than one kind of bacteria, 
 so it is more like searching 
 a billion haystacks 
 for a million needles. 
 [DOM] And where are 
 we supposed to find these 
 haystacks, or needles? 
 Bacteriophages. The metaphor 
 is not helping. 
 We need to collect the phages, 
 as many as we can, as fast as we can. 
 [CHARLIE] Phage therapy is experimental. 
 We would need a compassionate 
 use authorization from the FDA, 
 - but they've... 
 - But that's tomorrow's problem. 
 Today, we've got to find 
 the right phage. 
 According to the microbiology department 
 of the CDC, the most common sources 
 of bacteriophages are swamps, 
 farms, storm drains, and sewage plants. 
 I noticed her left forearm 
 felt cold with a weak pulse. 
 - Septic emboli? 
 - Poor blood flow. 
 Already showing signs of ischemia. 
 We can do a thrombectomy, 
 try to remove the clot 
 and slow progress of infection. 
 Her body's putting a ton of 
 resources into saving this arm, 
 which is taking energy away 
 from saving her vital organs. 
 She can live without an arm. 
 [SIGHS] 
 Let's try the thrombectomy first. 
 We need transport. 
 I have taken your concerns into account 
 and formed a new treatment plan. 
 I don't want 
 a new treatment plan, Shaun. 
 You don't know. You haven't looked. 
 We will do a fluorescence-guided 
 awake brain surgery 
 with cortical stimulation. 
 Shaun, I appreciate that 
 you're doing this out of, 
 you know, love. 
 But sometimes when you love someone, 
 you don't have to fight every fight. 
 You don't have to persevere 
 to the ends of the earth. 
 Sometimes, when you love someone, 
 you just, you know, take 'em bowling. 
 Six years ago, you didn't give up, 
 and you got to see me get married. 
 You got to meet your grandson. 
 You got to save more lives. 
 You were wrong then, 
 - and you are wrong now. 
 - Shaun, look at me, please. 
 Listen to me. Look at me, please! 
 Is my tumor recurrent, yes or no? 
 Yes. 
 Is it aggressive? 
 Is it even more aggressive? 
 There are better treatments now. 
 We just need to buy you some time. 
 I shouldn't have told you. 
 [THUD] 
 You are being selfish. 
 And you are a coward. 
 You could keep fighting 
 and have more time with me 
 and with Lea and with Steve, 
 but you are giving up. 
 You are giving up on all of us. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 If you are giving up on me... 
 then I have to give up on you. 
 [DR. LIM] The thrombectomy 
 didn't fully clear the blood clot. 
 It's obstructing blood flow, 
 and the arm is showing 
 signs of necrosis. 
 I think we need to amputate. 
 Or we could try an open thrombectomy. 
 It'll give us better access to the clot. 
 It'll also risk seeding 
 the infection to other places. 
 We could start a heparin drip, 
 see if it'll give us better blood flow. 
 The arm is taking resources 
 the rest of her body desperately needs. 
 Her creatinine and LFTs are trending up. 
 Her liver and her kidney 
 are starting to fail. 
 Putting off amputation any longer, 
 it risks her life. 
 She wouldn't be a surgeon anymore. 
 She loves her job 
 and is very good at it. 
 I know. 
 But what she loves 
 is the young girl in Guatemala 
 who walked half a day 
 to the hospital with a broken ankle. 
 And the old man who 
 just lost his wife of 52 years 
 and needed someone to hold his hand. 
 And the first-year surgical resident 
 who was different, 
 but she saw something special in him. 
 Claire loves people, 
 and she will find a way 
 to take care of people, 
 no matter what. 
 And I think, if she was here right now, 
 listening to all of this, 
 she would tell us 
 to take her damn arm 
 and trust that she will find 
 a way forward, 
 because she... 
 she always has. 
 Prep the OR. 
 I thought you could use 
 some baby snuggles. 
 [CHUCKLES] 
 You have no idea. 
 [LEA] Mm. 
 Come here. 
 Come here. I gotcha. 
 I gotcha. 
 Hi. 
 Hi. I gotcha. I gotcha. 
 [SIGHS] I said no to 
 Shaun's plan twice. 
 I thought he'd be ready to 
 accept this eventually. 
 Well, ""eventually"" probably 
 means more than 48 hours. 
 [SIGHS] 
 I spent a couple of decades 
 trying to prepare him 
 for when I 
 wasn't going to be around anymore. 
 Apparently, that wasn't enough. 
 Glassy... 
 I love you. 
 You are the first-wisest 
 and second-smartest person I know, 
 but if you think you 
 haven't done enough for Shaun, 
 then I am sorry, 
 but you are a ginormous idiot. 
 Look at who you're holding. 
 That baby is here 
 because of what you did. 
 I'm here because of what you did. 
 You saw who he was, who he could be. 
 You saved his life, and he knows it. 
 He will come around... 
 eventually. 
 Hi. 
 He doesn't have a whole lot of time. 
 [MONITOR BEEPS, RESPIRATOR HISSING] 
 [DR. LIM] 10-blade. 
 We've concluded our tour 
 of the most disgusting barns 
 in Northern California. 
 I have received hundreds 
 of phages from the CDC. 
 Charlie and Dom 
 are on their way with 87. 
 Have any showed promise so far? 
 None whatsoever. 
 Shaun, uh, can I talk to you? 
 I have samples to test. 
 Uh, it's important. 
 We'll keep gathering. 
 I know of a slaughterhouse nearby. 
 [DR. PARK] You know of a slaughterhouse? 
 [DR. REZNICK] Mm-hmm. 
 You can't shut Glassman out. 
 I presented him with two plans. 
 He doesn't want them. That's his choice. 
 His choice is wrong. 
 No, it isn't, Shaun. 
 I know how hard it is for you to accept. 
 I know you don't want 
 to face any of this, 
 but Glassman is dying, Shaun. 
 And all this work you've 
 been doing to try to save him 
 is really for you. 
 You need a new plan. 
 A plan to say goodbye. 
 Right now, you can't 
 make yourself feel okay 
 about Glassman's decision, 
 and that is okay. 
 You don't have to. 
 But... 
 he is going to die, 
 and if you are not with him 
 for his final days, 
 you will regret it 
 for the rest of your life. 
 So... 
 you need to plan, 
 for your final days with your father. 
 You are a very good friend. 
 I should have come earlier. 
 I am sorry. 
 Goodbye, Claire. 
 [CHARLIE] We've got it! 
 We've got it! 
 - The bacteriophage? 
 - Yes! 
 The right bacteriophage? 
 I said, ""We've got it."" 
 What else would I have meant? 
 Oh-ye! 
 I told you. I was not wrong. 
 I was not wrong to not say goodbye. 
 I will see you very soon. 
 You have the data. 
 It's in the green folders. 
 Stress the time frame, 
 the bacterial lysis times 
 were very striking, 
 and there were low levels of endotoxins. 
 Oh, also, uh, her amputated arm 
 isn't strictly relevant, 
 but because we're applying 
 for a compassionate use, 
 anything that'll make her appear 
 more sympathetic will be helpful. 
 We can appeal. 
 But the whole point 
 of a compassionate use 
 is to allow people with no other option. 
 They can take risks. 
 I am so angry. 
 Are you not angry? 
 Go back to the hospital 
 and prep Claire for 
 the bacteriophage treatment. 
 Are you going to... 
 I don't know. I need to think. 
 Are you okay, Shaun? 
 Is Claire going to be okay? 
 Why did you text us? 
 I texted you 
 because when I have important news, 
 you two are the people 
 I need to share it with. 
 On the day the copper pipes 
 in the old building 
 smelled like burnt food... 
 my brother taught me 
 that just because you 
 love somebody doesn't mean 
 you get to love them forever. 
 But I was okay 
 because I had you, Dr. Glassman. 
 And on the day that... 
 On the day that you go to heaven... 
 I will have Lea. 
 I will have little Steve. 
 And on the day 
 the carousel smelled like oil, 
 the carousel you used 
 to go to with Maddie, 
 I told you I would go there 
 and think of you 
 after you're gone, and I will. 
 But I want to go before then too. 
 I will go there with you. 
 And I will go bowling. 
 I will go bowling with you. 
 I will make a plan. 
 But I can't today because... 
 Because on the day you stood up 
 for me, I met Claire. 
 And she believed me. 
 And I spoke to people in this room, 
 and I told them I want to save people 
 so they can become adults 
 and have children 
 and love those children. 
 [VOICE BREAKING] But I don't... 
 I don't need to save everyone. 
 I just need to save Claire. 
 [BREATHES SHAKILY] 
 The FDA did not approve her treatment. 
 But I am going to give it to her anyway. 
 And then I won't be a doctor anymore. 
 And that's okay. 
 No. No. 
 No, Shaun, that's not okay. 
 Thank you. 
 I am Dr. Shaun Murphy. 
 I am Chief of Surgery 
 at San Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital. 
 I have autism spectrum disorder, 
 which is part of the reason 
 that I remember the names 
 of all 1,524 people 
 whose lives I've helped save. 
 There were a lot of people 
 who did not want me to be a surgeon 
 at Saint Bonaventure Hospital, 
 or anywhere, 
 because I was different. 
 I couldn't make eye contact. 
 I didn't know how to lie. 
 I made people uncomfortable. 
 But someone believed in me.

 [REMOTE CLICKS] 
 Dr. Claire Browne 
 is my friend. 
 Hello. 
 Dr. Glassman and I saved her life. 
 Dr. Glassman saved over 4,000 lives. 
 He would say less, but I give him credit 
 for all the lives that I have saved, 
 because he taught me 
 a mnemonic for remembering 
 the effects 
 of organophosphate poisoning, 
 and he taught me that 
 if you just palm grip the needle driver, 
 you will get way more maneuverability, 
 and force control. 
 And he taught me... 
 that when you touch one life, 
 you don't just touch one life. 
 You touch every life 
 that that life touches. 
 Dr. Glassman said many wise things. Yes. 
 And over the years, I have 
 tried to write them down. 
 ""Think about what people can do, 
 not about what people can't do."" 
 ""Hear what I have to say, 
 and then decide if it's bad advice."" 
 ""Questions are good."" 
 ""Leads to awareness and understanding."" 
 ""And, who knows, maybe even acceptance."" 
 And when he wanted the board 
 to hire me, he said, 
 ""We will be a better hospital 
 for hiring him."" 
 ""We will be better people 
 for hiring him."" 
 And then he slammed 
 the desk with his hand, 
 because that is how you communicate 
 that you really mean 
 what you are saying. 
 [SOFT LAUGHTER] 
 He always knew people 
 were looking to him, 
 that they might take lessons from him. 
 And if they did, 
 he always wanted that lesson to be... 
 ""Don't be an ass."" 
 [LAUGHTER] 
 ""Don't be an ass."" 
 It's not always easy. 
 Together, we planned, 
 and six months after he died, 
 I started... 
 the Dr. Aaron Glassman Foundation 
 for Neurodiversity in Medicine, 
 which is today run by myself 
 and Dr. Claire Browne, 
 and has affiliations with 17 hospitals 
 and 32 medical schools. 
 I wanted to help people 
 and save lives. 
 And I wanted to make a lot of money 
 so that I could buy a television. 
 But because of Dr. Glassman, 
 I have much more than that. 
 I have many friends. 
 And I have a family. 
 And I have two televisions.
