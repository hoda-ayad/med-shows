Turk, who is a surgical intern, introduces J. D. to Dr. Todd Quinlan, the Todd, who proves to be a scalpel jock with a wicked high five. J. D. cautiously drifts through his first days trying to get the staff's approval, attempting to prove himself as a doctor, and hoping he is the doctor his patients expect him to be.
